Very strong winds aloft accompanied this system. A streak of very strong mid level winds punched northeast from the Arklatex region into the Lower Ohio Valley during the afternoon. A low level jet from 50 to 60 knots over the Lower Mississippi Valley nosed into the Lower Ohio Valley. At the surface, a low pressure center tracked from north central Arkansas to near St. Louis by late afternoon. Though surface dew points climbed into the lower to mid 60's, extensive cloudcover along and ahead of a warm front limited instability. The instability was generally weak, characterized by cape values below 1000 j/kg. Most of the damage was the result of a line of thunderstorms that suddenly accelerated northeast from New Madrid and Mississippi Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A macroburst approximately eight miles long and three miles wide struck the East Prairie area with winds up to 120 mph. The origins of the macroburst were in New Madrid County, but the vast majority of the event occurred in Mississippi County. The highest concentration of damage was in East Prairie. On County Road 535 on the outskirts of East Prairie, two mobile homes were demolished. A single-wide mobile home was completely separated from the frame, which was blown 100 yards until it struck a brick house. The sole occupant of the mobile home was a young adult who received only numerous minor abrasions that did not require hospitalization. A second nearby single-wide mobile home was blown a very short distance into trees and destroyed. This mobile home had been vacant for years. Both mobile homes were tied down. A nearby house lost most of the roof, and a large section of the windward-facing exterior wall was blown in. In the city of East Prairie, three industrial buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed. A large industrial block building was partially unroofed, a wood frame metal building was destroyed, and a wooden industrial shop was destroyed. The roof of the police department was damaged.  Numerous trees were blown down in and near East Prairie, some damaging homes. Several farm buildings received minor to major damage southwest of town. Outside of town, several irrigation pivots were blown over, a barn was damaged, and a travel trailer was overturned. An empty grain bin was blown away. The peak wind of 120 mph was supported by damage to several structures, including the industrial buildings in East Prairie and the house and mobile homes on the outskirts of town. This was among the strongest downbursts ever documented in southeast Missouri.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The setup featured a 45 knot mid level flow and a 95 knot upper level jet.  Matter of fact, a larger area of showers, associated with a warm front, had moved across southeast Ohio and West Virginia during the morning and midday hours. This kept the surface based instability at a minimum.  However, new cells formed further west during the mid afternoon over western Ohio.  It was this new cluster of convection that would intensify due to the strong mid and upper level dynamics.  Several of the new cells formed and intensified on the southern or southwestern flank of the overall larger area of showers and thunderstorms.  This area of convection stretched further to the northeast into eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania.  This allowed an unimpeded low level moisture inflow into the new development.  Surface dew points ahead of the cold front reached into the mid 60s.||Most of the severe thunderstorms exhibited strong rotation, resulting in the spawning of 5 tornadoes.  Four of these 5 tornadoes were in Ohio.  One of the 4 Ohio tornadoes crossed from Fairfield County into western Perry County.   Another 1 of the 4 crossed from Perry into northwestern Morgan County.  One tornado patch was solely in western Athens County.  The damage continued another 10 miles in Athens County from a strong rear flank downdraft.  Finally, the last of the 4 tornadoes in Ohio crossed the Ohio River from northeastern Meigs County into southern Wood County in West Virginia.  From storm surveys, this was the strongest tornado.  The last tornado path in this outbreak was solely in western West Virginia.  Luckily, there were no fatalities in southeastern Ohio.  However, there was one death on the West Virginia side of the Ohio River.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The upstream tornado lifted, as the rear flank downdraft of the rotating thunderstorm took over.  This downburst became the dominant feature in The Plains and around the community of Athens.  The width of the damage path widened to about a quarter of a mile.  Winds were estimated as high as 100 mph in The Plains.  As the storm approached, soccer players, fans, coaches, and referees took shelter in the locker rooms, the wrestling rooms, and the lounge for teachers at Athens County High School.  About a dozen adults took shelter in the concession stand.  A few of these parents were injured when the roof was heavily damaged.  The light poles, the press box, and the scoreboard were also damaged or destroyed.  On the roof of the high school, large air condition units were blown off and damaged parked cars.  Several homes were destroyed or damaged.  Roof damage was widespread.  As the wind reached the eastern sections of the town of Athens, the maximum wind gusts were estimated at 80 to 100 mph.  The last significant damage was to an automobile service and towing garage.  The total distance of this downburst was on the order of 10 miles.  A total of 6 people were injured.  About 17 homes were destroyed, many others were damaged.||Including both this downburst and the tornado, Ohio Emergency Managment Agency categorized around 30 homes as destroyed, 51 homes with major damage, and 83 homes with minor damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At the same time, a warm front was advancing north through the state. The added shear or change of wind speed and direction with height near the proximity of this front caused most of the severe thunderstorms as well as one tornado in Ocean County. About 50,000 homes and businesses lost power, many of them in Middlesex, Monmouth and Ocean Counties. All power was restored by the evening of the 17th. Many shore high school football games were postponed because of the dangerous weather.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A wet microburst associated with a severe thunderstorm caused considerable tree and some wind damage in Perth Amboy. The estimated maximum wind speed was about 80 mph and struck the historic district in the southeast part of Perth Amboy the hardest. About 15 to 20 homes and buildings were damaged. One family on Paterson Street had to be relocated because the roof over the front door of their home became detached. A state of emergency was declared and only emergency responders were permitted to travel through the southeast part of the city. It was lifted on the 18th when most streets were passable again. There was a measured wind gust of 73 mph within Perth Amboy.  A funnel cloud also passed across the city, but did not touch down.  Damage from the microburst occurred in an area bounded by 2nd Street to the west, Smith Street to the north, and the waterfront on the east and south. The most concentrated damage occurred on Water, Market and High Streets. Snapped trees and tree branches were the prevalent damage type, but roof and chimney damage also occurred in several locations. A couple of cars were also damaged by downed trees. No homes experienced significant structural damage, but several garages were badly damaged by either the winds themselves or collaterally from flying and/or falling debris. One minor injury due to flying debris occurred along First Street. The worst damage was located in a two-block area bounded by Second Street, Gordon Street, Madison Avenue and Lewis Street. Several large trees and numerous power lines were blown down, and structural damage occurred to several garages. Numerous houses in this area suffered roof damage, mainly in the form of lost shingles and damaged or destroyed chimneys. Several homes had sections of roofs torn away. A roof was also torn from one industrial building along Second Street, portions of which were transported several blocks away. Extensive tree damage also occurred in and near Bayview Park. Personnel from the city of Perth Amboy and the city of Woodbridge worked through the night to clean up the storm debris.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The squall line reached the city of Mayaguez,  producing strong gusty winds that  downed a scaffold equipped with lighting equipment at the Isidoro Garcia Park, near the Mayaguez coast. Several persons were injured and some vehicles were damaged as the platform fell to the ground. Downed trees and power lines were reported in several municipalities of western Puerto Rico. Officials were forced to delay the Opening Ceremony.The NOS-NWLON sensor at the Penuelas-Guayanilla Bay reported a wind gust to 53 mph at 12:17 pm as the squall line moved through. The Cabo Rojo National Wildlife Refuge sensor recorded at wind gust to 48 mph at 1:14 pm. Data from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Company (PREPA) wind sensor at El Mani site near the Mayaguez airport, indicated wind gusts of around 33 mph at 1230 pm, 36 mph at 1245 pm, and 30 mph at 1:00 pm. The PREPA net highest wind gust was recorded at La Parguera sensor in Lajas where a 46 mph gust was recorded around 12 noon. Other locations in Puerto Rico recorded wind gusts that varied from 35-45 mph. Initial local and national media reports attributed this wind event to a tornado or a waterspout that had moved inland. However, most of the evidence indicates that it was an outflow boundary that propagated from the east southeast to the west northwest.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Strong gusty winds downed a scaffold equipped with lightning equipment at the Olympic Stadium along road 102 in Mayaguez.

A very unstable air mass was present over South Texas (CAPE values from 4500 to 5500 J/kg).  At 7 pm CDT, the first line of thunderstorms entered the Rio Grande Valley and produced hail up to the size of nickels, localized flooding and strong winds.  The second line of thunderstorms extended across much of Central Texas and began accelerating and tracking southward from Tilden to Goliad by late in the evening.  The two lines of thunderstorms merged around Tilden and Choke Canyon Reservoir near 1000 pm CDT causing intensification to the convective complex of storms.  This was evident by severe storms over Live Oak and Bee counties with increased reflectivity and cloud to ground lightning between 1030 and 1100 pm CDT.  At the same time, the northern|line of thunderstorms continued through the Victoria Crossroads area and slowly weakened.||The strongest portion of the solid line of thunderstorms continued southeastward into the central Coastal Bend. Reports of trees down and power outages increased from along I-37 to Corpus Christi from the most intense portion of the line of thunderstorms.  WSR-88D detected small areas of rotation over Aransas, San Patricio and Nueces Counties between 1100 and  midnight CDT when tornado warnings were issued.  Wind gusts of 60 mph were common from automated weather stations as the storms slammed the lower Coastal Bend.  Power outages from the wind were significant by midnight and there were many reports of trees and power lines down, and rescue operations for recreational trailers that were tipped over on the base of Navy Corpus Christi and a flipped 18-wheeler. In this area, automated sensors measured wind as high as 80 mph.  The lightning was intense and continuous|at times, which caused additional damage to a few structures. The line of thunderstorms produced widespread 1 to 2 inches of rain across South Texas with locally higher amounts. Total cloud to ground lightning strikes observed by|the National Lightning Detection Network were near 38,000 from 800 pm to 200 am CDT.  In Nueces County up to 31,000 residence had interruption to their power according to AEP.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An NWS storm survey team concluded 80-90 mph winds occurred on NAS Corpus Christi, producing damage consistent with straight-line winds.  4 recreational vehicles were flipped and several others moved.  6 people were injured, with one of them receiving critical injuries.  Also, debris from a boast barn was blown into the Laguna Madre, and actual boats tossed into a nearby parking lot.  The survey team also observed numerous trees damaged or uprooted through NAS Corpus Christi.  In addition, one hangar door was blown off its tracks.  Finally, the team observed tree and sign damage in Flour Bluff, as well as a car port and roof of a nearby apartment complex damaged.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Most rivers in the county warning area reached flood stage. Other effects include numerous traffic collisions, roadway flooding and closures, swift water rescues, beach closures and millions of dollars in damage to homes, businesses and infrastructure.

Alex was the first Hurricane in June for the Altantic Basin since 1995, and the strongest in the month of June since Hurricane Alma in 1966. Alex was a very large hurricane with tropical storm force winds extending over 200 miles from the center. Although Alex passed over 200 miles south of Corpus Christi, tropical storm force wind gusts were measured as far north as Port O'Connor, George West, and Cotulla. The strongest winds were observed on the barrier island from Port Aransas to Baffin Bay where peak wind gusts exceeded 60 mph.||Overall, the impacts to the Middle Texas coast were minimal. Storm tides peaked just below 4 feet mean sea level at tide stations along the coast producing flooding along area beaches. About a half dozen tornadoes occurred within the outer rain bands from Alex. These tornadoes caused mostly minor tree damage. Radar indicated the possibility of several more tornadoes, however NWS survey teams were unable to locate any additional damage. Heavy rainfall and flooding proved to be the biggest impact. Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches with isolated amounts near 10 inches were observed across South Texas. This resulted in flooding of many roads and farm fields from Alice to Sinton.||Less than $10 thousand in damages occurred from the 6 tornadoes.  However, nearly $5.5 million in damages resulted from flooding associated with the heavy rainfall, of which $5.25 million was observed in Webb County from flooding along the Rio Grande.  Nearly $1 million in crop damage, mostly to grain and sorghum was observed.

This started the runoff from a deep snow pack over the West Virginia mountainous counties.  A widespread 2 to 4 inches of water resided in the snow pack with some ridgetops exceeding 6 inches of water in the snow.  ||Flood concerns were high preceding the event, but mainly for the central and northern mountain counties of the state.  The deepest snow cover still resided across the high terrain in those counties.  Prior to the heavy rain, the snow cover over Fayette and Raleigh Counties had already melted away.  However, the ground was left soggy and primed to allow for a quick runoff.||Governor Manchin even declared a state of emergency before any rain arrived. ||An increasing southeast flow developed on Friday the 12th with dew points climbing into the mid and upper 40s.  The support for the showers was provided by a large mid and upper air low circulation, shifting east into the Tennessee Valley. |   |Showers developed early that evening, then moved northwest through the southern mountains of West Virginia into the Coal and Kanawha River Valleys.  A few thunderstorms were embedded within the heavier showers.  Training of these cells occurred in narrow bands oriented in an arch from southeast to northwest. ||Luckily, the heavy rain never transferred further north, where the mountain snow pack was still melting. ||In a 6 hour period ending at 0100E on the 13th, the Raleigh County Airport received 2.58 inches of rain, while Charleston had 0.80 inches.   By 0700E on the 13th, Beckley had a 3 inch rain total.   Oak Hill in Fayette County had 2.95 inches ending at dawn on the 13th.  The cooperative observer in Beckley measured 2.12 inches.  The Huff Knob automated rain gauge near Ghent measured 2.76 inches in the 12 hour overnight period.  On Tams Mountain, west of Sophia, another automatic rain gauge measured 2.1 inches in 12 hours.  Oceana of northern Wyoming County measured 2.3 inches.  Amounts around 2 inches in 12 hours were common through the Big Coal River Valley to around Charleston.  An unofficial spotter report of 3.6 inches was received just 1 mile southeast of downtown Beckley.  Further north, rain amounts around an inch reached into Nicholas County.  ||After dawn on the 13th, only spotty light rain lingered in the cooler air.  ||Major small stream flooding was widespread in Raleigh and Fayette Counties.  There were 2 direct fatalities from Raleigh County.  Flooding of less severity occurred in  Kanawha, Nicholas, Boone, and Wyoming Counties.  ||During the daylight hours on the 13th, the Kanawha and Coal Rivers rose rapidly and caused backwater flooding.  For example, the mouth of Paint Creek flooded in the Hansford and Pratt vicinity.  Later that night, the Coal River crested at 25.5 feet at Tornado, slightly over its 25 foot flood stage.  The crest on the Kanawha at Charleston was 29 feet, just under the 30 foot flood stage.||The American Red Cross served over 1000 meals and around 900 snacks in the affected flood zone.  They also distributed over 400 clean-up kits.  The Salvation Army and various church groups also came to the aid of the local citizens.  ||A federal disaster was declared that included Raleigh, Fayette, and Kanawha Counties.  See FEMA disaster number 1893 for more details.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Major stream flooding along such streams as Piney, Beaver, Little Beaver, Little Whitestick, and the headwaters of Dunloup Creek, including Maple Fork. Damage was less along the Marsh Fork and Clear Fork drainage in the western portion of the county. ||A 59 year old female turnpike worker was returning home from the evening shift.  She left her vehicle parked and attempted to walk through the flood waters of Maple Fork west of Bradley.  She was swept away and drowned.||The majority of the property damage in Raleigh County was along the urbanized Beaver Creek, Little Beaver Creek, and Piney Creek.  This would be in the vicinity of the communities of Beaver and Glen Morgan.  A stream gauge was located along Piney Creek upstream from the mouth of Beaver Creek.  The water level at this gauge rose from about 3 feet to a record high of 11.4 feet around 0430E on the 13th.||One resident along Beaver Creek said, I've lived here for 24 years and never seen anything like this.  Other residents along the lower reaches of Beaver Creek sought refuge in their attics and called 911 for help.  A swift water rescue team from the Glasgow Fire Department was working rescues along Beaver Creek.  The boat struck something in the water, lost its steering and crashed into a bridge.  The boat capsized, throwing 3 firefighters into the water.  Two were able to reach safety.  However, a 32 year old male firefighter was swept away.  His body was not found until the 19th along Piney Creek.  Beaver Creek flows into Piney Creek before emptying into the Kanawha River.       ||Many culverts under roadbeds could not handle the flow.  A few were completely washed out. ||Preliminary data indicated 29 homes were destroyed in Raleigh County, with major damage to 34 other homes.

Severe flooding in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, M��xico from June 30th through July 2nd, from an estimated 30 inches of rain in this area was a portent of future impacts on the Rio Grande during the weeks to come, lasting for much of July and the first third of August. ||Major flooding continued for nearly a month at Rio Grande City - and by proxy, southwest Hidalgo County - continuing through August 3rd! Flood conditions (50 feet or higher) continued a few days beyond, with levels dropping below flood stage on August 10th at Rio Grande City and just a little bit later in southwest Hidalgo County. In total, the river was likely in flood at points downstream in southwest Hidalgo County, from the morning of July 9th through at least August 10th - more than month. ||A number of small communities along the Rio Grande west of the Lower Rio Grande Valley Flood Control System were impacted by the sprawling river into early August, while releases remained at 60,000 cubic feet per second at Falcon International Reservoir until July 29th. These communities included locations in southwest Hidalgo County. The system of levees and floodways (spillways) downstream of Penitas (where improved levees begin along the river itself) largely worked as designed, containing and diverting water along the river and associated floodways extending through southern and eastern Hidalgo County into extreme northern Cameron and extreme southern Willacy County. However, additional water damage occurred to properties built inside the levees and floodways. Voluntary and mandatory evacuations were ordered for a number of threatened communities; as of this writing, no fatalities had been reported directly from the high waters. There were dozens of water rescues on the river through the period, many of them trans migrants attempting to cross from Mexico into Texas. ||On August 3rd, President Obama declared most counties in the Rio Grande Valley a Major Disaster, eligible for federal funding to assist with the longer term recovery. Deep South Texas Counties included Cameron and Hidalgo. Property and Crop damages from the flood may ultimately total well over $50 million when all assessments are completed. As of the end of July, property damage estimates in Hidalgo County had reached $22 million. Crops planted in flood zones were destroyed by the long duration of nutrient rich waters. Note: final damage cost estimated are provided in the July Storm Data report.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flooding of the Lower Rio Grande Valley Flood Control Project floodway/levee system (spillway), which includes the Banker Floodway (from near Granjeno to just south of Pharr), the Main Floodway (from just south of Pharr to the split at the Arroyo Colorado just southwest of Mercedes, the Arroyo Colorado itself, and the North Floodway, (which extends from near Mercedes to near La Villa before curving east to northwest Cameron County), continued through a good portion of August, as water continued to be diverted through Anzalduas for several days beyond the time that water was receding upstream of the dam.  Continuing water diversion helps reduce the potential for backwater flooding along the improved levee section (Penitas to Anzalduas) as well as unprotected shorelines west of Penitas.  At the same time, the diversion maintained several feet of water in the floodways for days to come which receded more slowly.  The floodway emptied out for the most part by August 15th, but local high water hazards continued through at least the 18th.   ||These floodways, protected by a robust system of levees and gates, protected communities outside of the levees by containing up to 50%, or 4 to 8 to feet of fast flowing water, within them into the first third of August.  Unfortunately, a number of residences, dozens of paved and unpaved roads with low water bridges, and some agriculture are located within  the floodways; significant damage was noted in several locations.  Pumping and plugging operations near Weslaco and La Villa successfully kept high water out of poor drainage locations where the potential for freshwater flooding due to heavy rains would have been exacerbated with periodic thunderstorms, which did not materialize in August.  Closed roads included  FM 493 and FM 1015, each moderately traveled; at least five homes were flooded along the Main Floodway south of Pharr along I Road; 15 to 20 homes were asked to voluntarily evacuate, and at least two other residences were flooded south of Weslaco near FM 88. Floodwaters also submerged portions of the Llano Grande golf course in Mercedes. ||Voluntary evacuations were finally lifted along I Road (Capote Farms subdivision) on August 18th at 6 PM CST, where the 15 to 20 homes mentioned above were located.  Wet, muddy conditions continued in these areas until the last week of August; damage assessments began on roadways and bridges impacted in the floodway after the waters finally receded.  In all, the floodways contained water for more than 6 weeks.||High flowing water along the river covered a large portion of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge (Santa Ana) south and southeast of Pharr, including a number of unpaved roads.  Damage to the roads was unknown at this time; the flooding occurred downstream of the Anzalduas Diversion Dam; river gages downstream at San Benito and Brownsville remained in action stage.  Floodwaters did not reach public or private structures, nor roadways, between the Refuge and the Main Floodway.  The water finally receded back to muddy pockets sometime between August 27th and 28th.||There was one reported fatality in early August; a man drowned after reportedly driving his vehicle accidentally into the fast flowing waters of the floodway late on August 1st or early on August 2nd. His body was found along the south side of the Main Floodway, near S. Jackson and W. Juan Balli Road just west of Pharr.  ||Several crops may have been destroyed by the flood along the Main and North Floodways, but damage was unknown as of this writing in this area.  Property and infrastructure damage may have exceeded [$10] million in these areas.

In Massachusetts, two day rainfall totals ranged from one and a half inches on Cape Cod to nearly eight inches in Bristol County.  Providence, Boston, and Blue Hill Observatory in Milton, MA set record monthly precipitation totals during the month of March. Providence also set the record for the wettest month ever in the period of record. Both the Pawtuxet River in Rhode Island and the Sudbury River in Massachusetts set floods of record.  Nearly 1000 Massachusetts National Guardsmen were activated to aid in sandbagging and evacuations.

Numerous streets were closed due to flooding in Taunton, Fall River, Dartmouth, Norton, Dighton, Raynham, Somerset, North Attleboro, Attleboro, Freetown, Westport, Berkley, Mansfield, Rehoboth, and Swansea, including Route 6 in Westport, Interstate 195 at Exit 3 in Swansea, Route 24 in Dartmouth, and Route 140 in Freetown (exit 8).  The North Attleboro Town Hall sustained $350,000 worth of damage from flooding and Richards Memorial Library was closed for several weeks after the basement was flooded with water and sewage.  A pond at Capron Park Zoo in Attleboro overflowed, threatening zoo buildings.  It was able to be pumped out, keeping water out of most of the buildings.  One building was flooded with two feet of water, damaging boxes of gift shop items and supplies.||Route 44 on the Taunton/Raynham line was closed for the second time in a month due to flooding from the Taunton River.  An amphibious vehicle from the Boston Duck Tours was called into service to ferry residents from isolated neighborhoods to nearby supermarkets and pharmacies.||One bridge (Wheeler Street) was destroyed and three others damaged in Rehoboth when the Palmer River flooded.  Portions of two of the damaged bridges (Danforth and Elm Streets) were undermined and washed away and the Summer Street bridge sustained structural damage.  Two people were rescued when they fell into the Palmer River while trying to rescue their dog.  They were transported to Rhode Island Hospital.||Sixteen year round residents at the Canoe River Camp Ground in Mansfield were evacuated.  Three apartment buildings on Riverbank Road in Attleboro were completely surrounded by water overflowing from the Ten Mile River.  The Seven Mile River in South Attleboro overflowed its banks, flooding Pitas Avenue, isolating twenty homes.  Six structures in North Attleboro were evacuated because of flooding.||In hard-hit Fall River: Numerous roads were flooded, including Columbia Street and Mount Hope Avenue.  Storm water overwhelmed storm drains, blowing out of the manholes with such force that it ripped up pavement, gravel, and utilities.  Twenty nine homes lost power and gas service when the utilities were ripped up.  Bricks from sidewalks along Columbia Street floated down Canal and Columbia Streets, collecting in piles on Broadway and Anawan Street.  Doran Elementary School was flooded and the sewage treatment plant became overwhelmed with flood waters.  A vehicle became stuck in floodwaters, trapping the occupants.  Railroad tracks were under water at Interstate 195 and at Route 6.  The southbound lanes of Route 24 were closed from President Avenue to Route 195.  A 25 foot wide sinkhole developed on Jackson Street.  At least 300 people were evacuated from their homes.  The mayor declared a state of emergency.||In Freetown:  85 school-children were taken to a shelter after flooding made it impossible for buses to take them home.  The Assonet Bay Shores neighborhood (home to about 1000 people) was cutoff to regular traffic by floodwaters and the collapse of a Narrows Road/Causeway Road bridge.  Eleven students at the Crystal Springs School (a learning center for children and adults with learning disabilities) were stuck at the school for an evening after the bridge collapsed.  They were able to be transported back to the main part of the city when two mountain rescue vehicles owned by the state police were dispatched.  The vehicles remained in place for several days to transport residents between the neighborhood and the rest of the city.  A bridge 20 yards downstream from the Forge Pond Dam crumbled, leaving a four foot gap in Forge Road.  Fifteen households in Assonet Village were evacuated  as Forge Pond continued to rise.  Schools were closed early Tuesday, March 30 and for the day Wednesday, March 31 due to flooding.  ||There were three minor house fires in Mansfield that were the result of floodwaters reaching burners and electrical panels in basements.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 23.58M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In eastern Massachusetts, a strong southeasterly low level jet pumped ample moisture into the area, resulting in rainfall totals on the order of six to ten inches.  This resulted in major flooding across eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island, including small stream, urban, and poor drainage flooding.  In addition, the Concord River at Lowell, the Shawsheen River at Wilimington, and the Pawtuxet River at Cranston reached record flood stages within two to four days of the rain.  The Governor of Massachusetts declared a state of emergency and this was followed by a federal disaster declaration for seven Massachusetts counties.||Strong winds associated with the low pressure system and the low level jet affected both the east and south coasts, resulting in numerous downed trees and wires and some minor structural damage to a few buildings.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Several small streams rose above flood stage across Essex County, including the Ipswich River at Ipswich and South Middleton, the Shawsheen River at Andover, and the Parker River at Byfield.

Portions of Merrimack College in Andover were flooded, submerging trees downed by the wind.  Several cars were stranded in floodwaters, including one in Saugus at the Shaws parking lot, three on Woburn Street in Andover, and two on Foster Street in Peabody.  Several people were trapped in the cars in Peabody, but were successfully rescued.  Many streets in downtown Peabody were under four feet of water.  Collections at the Stevens Memorial Library in North Andover were damaged by floodwaters.||In Lawrence, a total of 50 homes on Willow Street, Exchange Street, and Myrtle Street were evacuated.  In addition, twenty eight people in the Holiday Inn Express on Winthrop Street were evacuated due to flooding in the hotel.  Approximately 25 three tenant homes along the Spicket River were evacuated.  The Carriage Hill Apartments in Amesbury were evacuated due to flooding from a nearby pond.  The Washington Park Condos and all 110 residents of the Marland Place Assisted Living Center in Andover were evacuated.||A 500 foot stretch of Route 62 in Danvers was closed when a fifteen foot deep sinkhole developed because of an underground culvert that was washed out after nearly eight inches of rain fell.  It reopened nearly three weeks later after work was delayed by a second major rainstorm.|A sewer treatment plant in Gloucester processed roughly 15 million gallons of wastewater during the storm, nearly 5 times capacity.

This system brought scattered heavy-rain producing thunderstorms to eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.  For many areas it was the 3rd day-in-a-row with significant or heavy rain.  Many locations from central into northeast Nebraska received 3 to 4 inches or more rainfall in the 72 hours ending the morning of the 12th.  This additional heavy rain fell on saturated soils from rainfall prior to the 10th and prolonged, intensified or increased the coverage of flooding across eastern Nebraska and helped shift the flooding to larger rivers.  Flood damage over Nebraska in mid to late June amounted to at least 20 million dollars to public property alone and which did not account for damage to private property or crops.  The White House declared a federal disaster for 53 counties in Nebraska for June flooding.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Rainfall of at least 3 to 5 inches fell over much of the upper Elkhorn River basin in the week ending 7am 6/12.  This caused record or near record flooding along the Elkhorn River from around Clearwater and Neligh downstream to the Elkhorn's confluence with the Platte River.  The flooding was prolonged and intensified by additional rains the next few days.  In Madison county many gravel roads along the Elkhorn were flooded as were Highways 81 and 275 near and west of Norfolk which were closed for a while.  On 6/15 a railroad bridge just southwest of Norfolk washed away with 3 people on it that were assessing possible damage.  One person was drowned, the 2 others were rescued.  Another railroad bridge west of Norfolk and several sections of the Cowboy Trail bike trail was washed out.  A levee just south of Norfolk helped prevent major damage, but some damage was noted to businesses and nearly 70 homes on the south part of town despite sandbagging. In addition a park on the south side of town received extensive damage.  Farmland along the river sustained crop damage and had sand deposited on fields by the receding river.   The Elkhorn River near Norfolk reached a record crest of around 16.9 feet during the evening of 6/16, flood stage is 12 feet.  The river at Norfolk was above flood stage from the early morning hours of June 15th until mid evening on the 17th, although flooding likely started earlier upstream of the levee near Norfolk.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Buffalo, Trempealeau, Jackson, Taylor, Clark, and Juneau counties were included in federal disaster declarations (FEMA-1933-DR).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Widespread flooding occurred in Arcadia as water from Turton Creek and Meyers Valley Creek over-topped their banks and flowed into town. Water from Turton Creek flowed down Main Street, while water from Meyers Valley Creek bypassed a small bridge and flowed into the town. There were 343 homes evacuated. More than 100 people needed help from emergency responders, who used heavy machinery and boats, to  evacuate from their homes. Many vehicles were stranded, and some road damage occurred. Turton Creek washed away a 100-foot section of North Oak Street. Many homes and several businesses sustained damage, some of which incurred major damage. The rainfall amounted to 5.35 inches in Arcadia as of 4:15 a.m. CST on the 23rd, while it continued to rain through the day on the 23rd with a total of 6.92 inches.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7.64K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Strong convection formed north of a warm frontal boundary lifting north through the state.  A cold front dropped southeast, producing severe weather on the 21st before it stalled out to the south of the state.  As it lifted northward, deep moisture was transported into the upper Midwest as the remnants of a former eastern Pacific Hurricane was drawn north.  The tropical moisture resulted in heavy rainfall over a large part of Iowa again on the 23rd, with some places in southern Minnesota receiving 6 to 10 inches of rain.  The rainfall from Minnesota flowed down the Des Moines River and produced flooding as far south as Humboldt.  The heavy rain that fell over Iowa during this event caused flooding farther south on the mainstem Des Moines, and on the South Fork Chariton River.  The flooding caused some property damage and minor crop damage.  Since much of the summer saw very elevated river levels, the flooding caused less damage than would be otherwise expected.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Many streams and rivers flooded, but the worst flooding occurred in Delaware, Chester, Montgomery and Philadelphia Counties where waterways crested at moderate to major levels. For many gaged waterways, it was the worst flooding since June of 2006. Around Delaware County it was described as the worst flooding since Hurricane Floyd in 1999. The first round of heavy rain occurred during the early morning of September 30th, but extremely dry antecedent soil conditions were able to absorb most of the heavy rain and mainly just poor drainage flooding occurred. The second and heavier round of precipitation moved in during the evening of September 30th and continued into the morning of October 1st.

The low slowly weakened as it moved north and reached Pennsylvania on the evening of September 30th. Another low pressure system formed off the Carolina coast during the late morning of September 30th. This low was able to ingest tropical moisture associated with dissipating Tropical Storm Nicole. At 8 p.m. EDT on the 30th, the low pressure system moved north into eastern North Carolina and at 2 a.m. EDT on October 1st, it moved into the Delmarva Peninsula. At 8 a.m. EDT on October 1st, the low pressure system was just east of Atlantic City on its way to passing through eastern Long Island during the afternoon of October 1st.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Perkiomen Valley was hit the hardest by flooding in Montgomery County.

After a path length of about 0.43 mile in Kenosha County, it crossed into Racine County where CTH EA (72nd Ave) intersects County Line Rd. The tornado moved northeast and dissipating in the northeast section of Graceland Cemetery on the west side of the City of Racine, about 500 feet west of Osborne Boulevard. In Racine County, the tornado blew a weakly anchored barn (built in the 1920s) off its foundation and damaged an industrial building south of STH 11.  Later on, it tore off a 100'x200' roof section of the Case/New Holland building, damaged several HVAC units on the roof, and tore off some of the building's garage doors. The Case/New Holland plant was closed until Monday, November 1st while the roof was being repaired.  Two workers in this plant were injured by the tornadoes effects. Additionally, a tractor and it's semi-trailer on the Case/New Holland site were blown over and damaged.  wo other businesses on STH 11 reported roof damage.  At least 3 homes sustained damage. State Highway 11 was closed for a time in eastern Racine County due to debris and fallen power lines, closing or disrupting business at stores along Highway 11, especially in the 7000 and 7100 blocks.  At a church 2 miles northeast of the intersection of STH 11 and Oakes Rd., damage was inflicted to its roof, siding windows and a brick sign.  Numerous trees and a few power lines were blown down or broken along the path of the tornado. At one point, about 2700 customers lost electrical power. There were reports of a couple vehicle accidents as drivers tried to avoid the tornado.  The tornado path averaged 50 yards in width, with a maximum width of 100 yards. The EF-rating was based on DI 23 DOD 4 EXP103 with estimated wind speeds up to 105 mph. The exact start location in Racine County is Lat 42.66901 Lon -87.89515. The exact end location is Lat 42.72845 Lon -87.82596.  The path of the tornado was not a straight line, rather, a rough curved line with an actual path length of 5.92 miles within Racine County.  After crossing STH 11 about 1/10 of a mile east of North Branch Pike River, the tornado path bearing changed from NNE to NE.

A 2007 Honda CR-V was driving northbound on Highway 141 when the tornado picked it up and slammed it sideways into a wall along the highway.  The occupant, a 70 year old woman, sustained major injuries and died about eleven days later from her injuries.  The tornado then hit a church, elementary school and parsonage, which sustained various degrees of damage with the parsonage having the highest degree of damage.  Most of the roof was removed and one wall collapsed. Three trees sustained substantial damage in which one tree was partially debarked.  Damage intensity was rated EF2 while the damage width was 100 yards.||The tornado moved through the Fenton City Park and crossed the Meramec River half mile north of Highway 30.  Much of the tree damage was minor over this area.  The tornado paralleled Watson Road and crossed it near Bond Road where three separate large trees damaged a house, vehicle and garage.||The tornado continued northeast and crossed Interstate 270, two miles southeast of Interstate 44.  Just east of I-270 the tornado paralleled Old Watson Road in which an intermittent path of damage was observed.  One home northeast of I-270 sustained minor roof damage and a second home further northeast experienced shingle and tree damage.  The damage over this area was rated EF1 while the damage width was 50 yards.||At approximately 11:56 AM the tornado rapidly intensified as it neared Lindbergh Blvd.  Many trees in Watson Trail Park were snapped or uprooted.  Seven homes along Old Watson Road sustained varying degrees of damage.  Peak intensity was EF3 with 145 mph winds.  Two homes had the roofs removed and most of the exterior walls collapsed.||Several homes along Court Drive sustained significant damage.  The worst damage occurred on the east end of Court Drive in which four homes had large portions of the roof removed and one had several walls collapsed.  Damage intensity was rated EF3 with wind speeds near 150 mph.||On Lindbergh Blvd, one home was completely demolished and moved less than 50 yards from the foundation.  A brick veneer garage was also destroyed by the tornado.  Further north on Lindbergh a medical facility also sustained heavy damage.  Damage over this area was rated EF3, but the demolished home was rated high-end EF3.  Damage over this area was a quarter of a mile wide.||The tornado crossed Lindbergh near Court Drive and crossed over a strip mall.  Two cars and a delivery truck were tipped over in the parking lot.  Several windows were blown in on the stores in the strip mall and a greenhouse behind and adjacent to the mall suffered roof and water pipe damage.  The tornado made a turn to the east-northeast and crossed the east end of Woodfox Drive.  About a dozen pine trees along the east end of Woodfox Drive were blown over, all lying to the north.  Eight homes on Woodfox Drive suffered roof damage and several trees were either pushed over or snapped off about halfway up the trunk.  The tornado crossed Woodpark Drive were it caused roof damage to three more homes and downed a large oak tree.  One home had the roof lifted and partially removed.  The damage path width from Woodfox to Woodpark was 300 yards wide and was rated EF1.||The tornado then turned a bit to the northeast and crossed Eggeling Lane and Gladlea Drive.  On Eggeling Lane, four homes suffered roof damage and several trees were downed.  On Gladlea Drive, three homes suffered roof damage and several more trees were downed.  This damage path was 150 yards wide and rated EF0.  The tornado crossed East Watson between Lynn Lane, Watson Woods Court, and Kathy Court.  On Lynn Lane, a couple of trees were snapped off and two homes suffered roof damage and had windows blown in.  This portion of the damage path was 100 yards wide and rated EF1.||The tornado crossed over Kathy Court and Fern Glen Drive.  Some large tree branches were broken which took down some power lines. This damage was rated EF0 and the damage path was 100 yards wide.||The tornado continued northeast and crossed the area near Maebern Terrace, Sturdy Drive and Crestwood Lane.  At Sturdy and Maebern Terrace, two homes suffered roof damage with one home having the roof lifted and partially removed.  A couple of large trees were also downed in this area. This damage was EF1 and 100 yards wide. The tornado continued northeast to Watson Road with minor tree and roof damage noted.  Six power poles were pushed over along Watson Road.

This outbreak brought 13 tornadoes to the forecast area. This occurred as potent storm system moved out of the Rockies and developed a strong area of low pressure across the Central Plains. This surface low caused a warm front to take shape and quickly lift northward across the forecast during the afternoon of the 29th. Warm and humid conditions pushed north, which led to unstable conditions over the region just ahead of the advancing strong cold front. The wind energy through the atmosphere was strong. The resulting wind shear (change in wind speed or direction with height) was strong and very favorable for rotating storms and supporting tornadoes. As the clash of systems occurred, a mix of supercell thunderstorms developed, along with a broken line of thunderstorms. A handful of these storms utilized the strong wind shear present and produced tornadoes. Overall, 13 tornadoes occurred with 5 being of the strong variety (EF2-EF3). The strongest tornado occurred over northwest Leake and southern Attala Counties. Here, an EF3 moved along a 10 mile path and destroyed numerous mobile homes, 6 people were injured. Four other strong tornadoes occurred and were all rated EF2. Two of these occurred in Yazoo County, one just southwest of Yazoo City and the other in Downtown Yazoo City. Numerous buildings were damaged along with many trees and power lines down. Another EF2 occurred in Starkville where it destroyed multiple mobile homes in town. Fifteen injuries occurred in this area. The final EF2 occurred in Smith County. This tornado had an 11 mile path which started just SW of Raleigh to 6 miles NE of Raleigh. One brick home sustained significant damage along with numerous other buildings and sheds damaged.||This outbreak broke a streak of 3 years when no tornadoes occurred during the month of November across Mississippi. Additionally, the last Fall outbreak of tornadoes occurred on November 24, 2004. Historically, November marks the peak of our 2nd severe weather season and ranks 3rd as the most active month for tornadoes in Mississippi, just a few behind March.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Initial damage was roof and siding damage to a church along Lynn Lane. The tornado then moved northeast through an area of apartment buildings, causing minor to moderate roof damage to a number of buildings, as well as downing several trees. The tornado then moved into the Pines Trailer Park, where it destroyed a number of mobile homes. Two large mobile homes were rolled and destroyed, and several mobile homes were moved a substantial distance and destroyed. Numerous large pine trees were snapped near the base, with several landing on mobile homes causing major damage. Numerous utility lines were snapped and downed, and a couple of poles were downed. This was the location of maximum damage. The tornado then moved northeast across Louisville Road, causing roof damage to several homes and continuing to snap trees. It moved through another trailer park, blowing out the skirting on several mobile homes and causing minor roof and structural damage to a couple. As the tornado passed through the east side of the Starkville High School complex, it twisted some light standards on the athletic fields and caused some minor fence damage. It then crossed Yellow Jacket Drive, blowing out a porch on a restaurant and causing some minor roof damage. As it crossed Highway 12, it blew down a couple of traffic lights, blew out a business sign, and damaged another porch on a restaurant. The tornado snapped a few trees and caused some shingle damage to a couple of homes on South Montgomery Street, and then dissipated. The tornado was rated EF2 based on the small area of the most intense damage in the Pines Trailer Park; the remainder of the damage was generally EF1 in nature.

This outbreak brought 13 tornadoes to the forecast area. This occurred as potent storm system moved out of the Rockies and developed a strong area of low pressure across the Central Plains. This surface low caused a warm front to take shape and quickly lift northward across the forecast during the afternoon of the 29th. Warm and humid conditions pushed north, which led to unstable conditions over the region just ahead of the advancing strong cold front. The wind energy through the atmosphere was strong. The resulting wind shear (change in wind speed or direction with height) was strong and very favorable for rotating storms and supporting tornadoes. As the clash of systems occurred, a mix of supercell thunderstorms developed, along with a broken line of thunderstorms. A handful of these storms utilized the strong wind shear present and produced tornadoes. Overall, 13 tornadoes occurred with 5 being of the strong variety (EF2-EF3). The strongest tornado occurred over northwest Leake and southern Attala Counties. Here, an EF3 moved along a 10 mile path and destroyed numerous mobile homes, 6 people were injured. Four other strong tornadoes occurred and were all rated EF2. Two of these occurred in Yazoo County, one just southwest of Yazoo City and the other in Downtown Yazoo City. Numerous buildings were damaged along with many trees and power lines down. Another EF2 occurred in Starkville where it destroyed multiple mobile homes in town. Fifteen injuries occurred in this area. The final EF2 occurred in Smith County. This tornado had an 11 mile path which started just SW of Raleigh to 6 miles NE of Raleigh. One brick home sustained significant damage along with numerous other buildings and sheds damaged.||This outbreak broke a streak of 3 years when no tornadoes occurred during the month of November across Mississippi. Additionally, the last Fall outbreak of tornadoes occurred on November 24, 2004. Historically, November marks the peak of our 2nd severe weather season and ranks 3rd as the most active month for tornadoes in Mississippi, just a few behind March.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The initial damage where the tornado developed was limited to some minor tree damage along Buddy Odom Road. The tornado tracked north northeast and rapidly became strong, with EF2 and low end EF3 damage occurring along the rest of the path. The tornado affected Shiloh and Buddy Odom Roads as well as State Highway 429 in Leake County; and County Roads 4022, 4033, 4126, 4045, 4171, 4142 and State Highway 14 in Attala County. Several mobile homes, including at least two double wides, were completely destroyed at several locations along the path, with debris carried well away from the remains. Impressive tree damage occurred at numerous locations along the path, including a couple of locations where some debarking/denuding was noted. Vehicles were rolled or tossed at several locations. A frame home was pushed off its foundation and a number of frame homes suffered moderate to major roof damage. Numerous power poles were snapped along the path. The widest point of the damage path was around a quarter mile, and was near Highway 14 in Attala County. Maximum winds were around 140 mph.

These storms produced two tornadoes, hail, heavy rain and some flooding.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Based on an eyewitness report, a tornado touched in the backyard of a home just west of Interstate 39, on the eastern edge of a subdivision.  The tornado then blew over a school bus near the intersection of Argyle and Harlem Roads.  There were six people on the bus, the driver and five children.  All six people were taken to the hospital but none of the injuries were serious.  The tornado then knocked down eleven electrical high tension towers just southwest of the same intersection.  The tornado continued northeast into western Boone county, and moved across largely open rural fields towards the town of Caledonia.  Significant damage occured to at least six buildings in Caledonia, with approximately 20 additional buildings sustaining minor damage.  Several large trees were snapped or uprooted and a grain bin was partially collapsed.

Scattered thunderstorms developed in the late evening and early morning hours ahead of the cold front as a weak upper level disturbance passed through the region. Large hail and damaging wind gusts occurred with some of those storms. Another round of storms developed on the cold front over eastern Oklahoma as it pushed into the area. Weak to moderate instability combined with very strong low level wind shear created an environment that supported supercell thunderstorm structures. Several supercells developed resulting in large hail and damaging wind gusts in the hours just before and after sunrise on the 31st. One of these supercells produced a long-track, strong tornado that killed four people in and near the town of Cincinnati in Washington County. Debris was transported by the tornado into northern Benton County and was reported in Bella Vista and Pea Ridge. The Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport (XNA) was closed for three hours to remove the debris from the flight line. Another supercell produced a short-lived, weak tornado in Carroll County that moved into Missouri.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This segment is the second of six segments of this long-track tornado. The tornado moved into Washington County snapping numerous trees as it approached the town of Cincinnati.

Two people were killed in the mobile home that was destroyed and a third person was killed either in or near a barn while he was tending to his cattle. At least seven injuries also occurred.

Ahead of this front, a south-southeast low level jet around 50 knots brought warmer and more moist air into the Mid Mississippi Valley. Thunderstorms gradually evolved into a loosely organized QLCS (quasi-linear convective system) across southeast Missouri. The system moved generally eastward at 35 mph. Given the presence of strong low level shear along the low level jet axis, the environment was favorable for the embedded supercell that produced an isolated tornado.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down about two miles southeast of Doniphan on the south side of Highway 142, then moved northeast for about a mile and a half.

Ahead of this front, a south-southeast low level jet around 50 knots brought warmer and more moist air into the Mid Mississippi Valley. Thunderstorms gradually evolved into a loosely organized QLCS (quasi-linear convective system) across southeast Missouri. The system moved generally eastward at 35 mph. Given the presence of strong low level shear along the low level jet axis, the environment was favorable for the embedded supercell that produced an isolated tornado.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down about two miles southeast of Doniphan on the south side of Highway 142, then moved northeast for about a mile and a half.

Here, minor damage occurred to a brick home. Tree damage in this area was more substantial and was in the upper EF2 range. Thousands of trees were uprooted and snapped. Many trees were also splintered in this area. The tornado then crossed Highway 413, just east of French Camp. The tornado reached high end EF3 intensity at this point and produced significant structural damage to a number of structures. Wind speeds ranged from 155 to 165 mph at this location. Three well built brick homes were nearly flattened with only 1 outer wall left standing. Other well built structures sustained major damage to the roof. The Crossroads Grocery was destroyed as the cinder-block structure collapsed on itself. Several vehicles were thrown in this area including at semi-truck. A cell tower was snapped in half. The intense damage continued along the track across Stuart-Weir Road and White Road. Several more structures were severely damaged or destroyed in this area along with significant devastation to timber. Along Pisgah and Dotson Roads, some of the most severe damage occurred and this was the location of the 5 fatalities. Here, dozens of mobile homes and conventional foundation homes were destroyed. Multiple vehicles were thrown with a few landing in trees. The widest part of the tornado was in this general area where it was 1.07 miles wide. The EF3 intensity damage occurred for about 4 miles. The tornado weakened as it tracked toward the Chester Community and crossed Weir-Salem Road and Chester-Mills Road. Here the damage was mostly tree damage with a dozen of homes or so receiving minor to major damage. Some homes had a small portion of roof torn off or shingles peeled away. One well built home was shifted off the foundation with a portion of the back of the home collapsed. Again, timber damage was significant with a large area of pine forest heavily damaged. EF2 damaged was noted there. The tornado continued through Chester and toward Highway 9 and Highway 15. Here mainly EF1 tree damage occurred.

This tornado touched down just south of I-20, west of Tallulah, in Madison Parish. The tornado intensified quickly and became large as it tracked at a fast pace to the northeast. The tornado moved at roughly 55 mph and was on the ground for 149 miles. The actual time on the ground was 2 hours and 44 minutes. The tornado touched 9 counties/parishes along it's path with the most significant damage occurring in Madison Parish, Warren, Yazoo, Holmes, Attala and Choctaw Counties. A great deal of the damage was in the EF2 and EF3 range with a couple locations of EF4 damage in Yazoo and Holmes Counties. Maximum winds peaked around 170 mph. Overall, 10 fatalities occurred along with 146 injuries. Five fatalities occurred in Choctaw County, 4 in Yazoo County, and 1 in Holmes County.||As we try and put this tornado into perspective for the state of Mississippi, this long track tornado ranks as the 4th longest in Mississippi history at 149 miles.  It is the widest known tornado with a maximum width of 1.75 miles.  It also ranks as the 9th deadliest tornado with 10 fatalities, making it the most deadly since November 21st 1992.  Lastly, this was the first violent tornado (F4 or greater) in the month of April since April 18th, 1978.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado moved out of extreme southeast Sharkey County and into west central Yazoo County and gained intensity as it tracked northeast. The tornado caused significant home damage northwest of Satartia, and again as it crossed Highway 3 near the Crupp Community. The tornado then moved through a rural area southwest of Yazoo City, causing major damage or destruction of a number of homes, as well as intense tree damage.  As the tornado approached the intersection of US Highway 49 and Highway 16, on the south side of Yazoo City, it reached its widest point and maximum intensity. Here the rating peaked at EF4 with maximum winds around 170 mph. The tornado had a maximum width of 1.75 miles. Several buildings, including a church and several businesses, were totally destroyed. The tornado continued moving through residential areas on the southeast side of Yazoo City, heavily damaging or destroying numerous homes.  The tornado continued northeast through rural northeastern Yazoo County before it tracked into Holmes County.||A total of four fatalities occurred in Yazoo County. All of the fatalities were individuals who were in mobile homes.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 140.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Additional thunderstorms occurred in association with the upper level disturbance.

Tornadoes were most numerous across central and southern Oklahoma, with significant damage occurring over many areas. |Severe thunderstorms erupted by mid afternoon across northern and western Oklahoma. Given the potent combination of ingredients in place, storms began to produce tornadoes quickly after initiation. Storm motions of 50 to 60 mph were common.||During the mid afternoon hours, severe weather was confined to northern Oklahoma. It was there a long track supercell storm produced tornadoes near the Kansas border - including one rated EF3 - from near Wakita to north of Braman.||The capping inversion that had delayed thunderstorm development into central Oklahoma weakened, allowing for explosive supercell development along the dry line along and west of the Interstate 35 corridor. Rapid development and intensification was common with the late afternoon storms, with storms becoming tornadic within a very short time after initiation. This round of storms would directly impact a large part of the Oklahoma City metro area at rush hour, and posed a significant threat to the area. The first tornado in this area occurred in Canadian County.||During the next several hours, tornadoes were clustered around the metro area, and at times there were multiple significant damaging tornadoes occurring simultaneously. Several of the tornadoes had long tracks. Damage from the tornadoes was substantial, with numerous structures, vehicles, trees and power poles/lines significantly damaged or destroyed. One of the more intense tornadoes moved across Lake Thunderbird east of Norman destroying numerous boats.||More storms developed across southwest and south central Oklahoma, and also quickly became tornadic. ||By 9 pm, 35 tornadoes had been reported. While the loss of three lives was tragic, the casualties could have been much higher given the storm's fast motions, their intensity, the time of day and the areas impacted. ||While exact monetary damage figures were not available, it is estimated that losses were in excess of $595 million. At least 450 sustained injuries, most of them minor. Unfortunately three people lost their lives. ||Note: The large number of injuries and tornadoes made it difficult to associate injuries with specific tornadoes. Injury numbers were included when we had confidence in the numbers. ||Note: The complex nature of storm evolutions and interactions made the job of classifying tornadoes difficult.

Tornadoes were most numerous across central and southern Oklahoma, with significant damage occurring over many areas. |Severe thunderstorms erupted by mid afternoon across northern and western Oklahoma.

Storm motions of 50 to 60 mph were common.||During the mid afternoon hours, severe weather was confined to northern Oklahoma. It was there a long track supercell storm produced tornadoes near the Kansas border - including one rated EF3 - from near Wakita to north of Braman.||The capping inversion that had delayed thunderstorm development into central Oklahoma weakened, allowing for explosive supercell development along the dry line along and west of the Interstate 35 corridor. Rapid development and intensification was common with the late afternoon storms, with storms becoming tornadic within a very short time after initiation. This round of storms would directly impact a large part of the Oklahoma City metro area at rush hour, and posed a significant threat to the area. The first tornado in this area occurred in Canadian County.||During the next several hours, tornadoes were clustered around the metro area, and at times there were multiple significant damaging tornadoes occurring simultaneously. Several of the tornadoes had long tracks. Damage from the tornadoes was substantial, with numerous structures, vehicles, trees and power poles/lines significantly damaged or destroyed. One of the more intense tornadoes moved across Lake Thunderbird east of Norman destroying numerous boats.||More storms developed across southwest and south central Oklahoma, and also quickly became tornadic. ||By 9 pm, 35 tornadoes had been reported. While the loss of three lives was tragic, the casualties could have been much higher given the storm's fast motions, their intensity, the time of day and the areas impacted. ||While exact monetary damage figures were not available, it is estimated that losses were in excess of $595 million. At least 450 sustained injuries, most of them minor. Unfortunately three people lost their lives. ||Note: The large number of injuries and tornadoes made it difficult to associate injuries with specific tornadoes.

At times, the tornado damage path widened up to a mile. The most significant damage was located north and northeast of Earlsboro near the Pottawatomie/Seminole county border. Here a two story home was destroyed except for a few interior walls. A pick-up truck was also lofted approximately a quarter of a mile, and a semi-trailer was lofted or rolled approximately 200 yards. Farther east along its path, seven high tension towers were downed.

This round of storms would directly impact a large part of the Oklahoma City metro area at rush hour, and posed a significant threat to the area. The first tornado in this area occurred in Canadian County.||During the next several hours, tornadoes were clustered around the metro area, and at times there were multiple significant damaging tornadoes occurring simultaneously. Several of the tornadoes had long tracks. Damage from the tornadoes was substantial, with numerous structures, vehicles, trees and power poles/lines significantly damaged or destroyed. One of the more intense tornadoes moved across Lake Thunderbird east of Norman destroying numerous boats.||More storms developed across southwest and south central Oklahoma, and also quickly became tornadic. ||By 9 pm, 35 tornadoes had been reported. While the loss of three lives was tragic, the casualties could have been much higher given the storm's fast motions, their intensity, the time of day and the areas impacted. ||While exact monetary damage figures were not available, it is estimated that losses were in excess of $595 million. At least 450 sustained injuries, most of them minor. Unfortunately three people lost their lives. ||Note: The large number of injuries and tornadoes made it difficult to associate injuries with specific tornadoes. Injury numbers were included when we had confidence in the numbers. ||Note: The complex nature of storm evolutions and interactions made the job of classifying tornadoes difficult. This represents our best scientific assessment based on ground and aerial surveys, data from multiple radars, photographic and video evidence and anecdotal information.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado continued from Pottawatomie county, moved through Seminole county and continued into Okfuskee County just east of Cromwell. This tornado lasted at least 30 miles, with significant damage along its entire path. At times, the tornado damage path widened up to a mile. The most significant damage was located north and northeast of Earlsboro near the Pottawatomie/Seminole county border. Here a two story home was destroyed except for a few interior walls. A pick-up truck was also lofted approximately a quarter of a mile, and a semi-trailer was lofted or rolled approximately 200 yards. Farther east along its path, seven high tension towers were downed. Several hangers were destroyed at the Seminole Municipal Airport north of Seminole, and one small aircraft was flipped onto one of the destroyed hangers. Two mobile homes were destroyed near the airport and one resident suffered a broken arm. Significant tree damage was reported along the entire track of the tornado, some of them debarked and stripped off all their branches. See the documentation by the NWS Tulsa office for information of this tornado in Okfuskee County. This tornado is labeled #J4.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado tracked northeast for seven miles and lifted near Bartahatchie Road, approximately one mile east of the intersection of Bartahatchie Road and Grubb Springs Road. Numerous trees were uprooted along the track. Traffic lights were severely damaged at the intersection of Highway 45 and Hamilton Road. One house near the beginning of the track suffered structural damage losing a garage and utility room. Several homes also sustained roof damage. A few vehicles also received damage from falling trees or other debris. One person was injured when a tree fell onto a vehicle. A small steel outbuilding was also destroyed with debris from the outbuilding being wrapped in amongst surrounding trees. A support on a built in carport was destroyed allowing a portion of the home roof to collapse. Several power lines were also knocked down along Hamilton and Grubbs Springs Road. In total, 9 homes sustained major damage from the tornado with 35 homes receiving minor damage. In addition, 3 mobile homes sustained major damage and 7 received minor damage. One business was destroyed, one business sustained major damage and 3 received minor damage. Several vehicles were damaged as well. Timber damage alone from the tornado was reported to be around 92 thousand dollars.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 350.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Tornadoes were most numerous across central and southern Oklahoma, with significant damage occurring over many areas. |Severe thunderstorms erupted by mid afternoon across northern and western Oklahoma. Given the potent combination of ingredients in place, storms began to produce tornadoes quickly after initiation. Storm motions of 50 to 60 mph were common.||During the mid afternoon hours, severe weather was confined to northern Oklahoma. It was there a long track supercell storm produced tornadoes near the Kansas border - including one rated EF3 - from near Wakita to north of Braman.||The capping inversion that had delayed thunderstorm development into central Oklahoma weakened, allowing for explosive supercell development along the dry line along and west of the Interstate 35 corridor. Rapid development and intensification was common with the late afternoon storms, with storms becoming tornadic within a very short time after initiation. This round of storms would directly impact a large part of the Oklahoma City metro area at rush hour, and posed a significant threat to the area. The first tornado in this area occurred in Canadian County.||During the next several hours, tornadoes were clustered around the metro area, and at times there were multiple significant damaging tornadoes occurring simultaneously. Several of the tornadoes had long tracks. Damage from the tornadoes was substantial, with numerous structures, vehicles, trees and power poles/lines significantly damaged or destroyed. One of the more intense tornadoes moved across Lake Thunderbird east of Norman destroying numerous boats.||More storms developed across southwest and south central Oklahoma, and also quickly became tornadic. ||By 9 pm, 35 tornadoes had been reported. While the loss of three lives was tragic, the casualties could have been much higher given the storm's fast motions, their intensity, the time of day and the areas impacted. ||While exact monetary damage figures were not available, it is estimated that losses were in excess of $595 million. At least 450 sustained injuries, most of them minor. Unfortunately three people lost their lives. ||Note: The large number of injuries and tornadoes made it difficult to associate injuries with specific tornadoes. Injury numbers were included when we had confidence in the numbers. ||Note: The complex nature of storm evolutions and interactions made the job of classifying tornadoes difficult.

Tornadoes were most numerous across central and southern Oklahoma, with significant damage occurring over many areas. |Severe thunderstorms erupted by mid afternoon across northern and western Oklahoma. Given the potent combination of ingredients in place, storms began to produce tornadoes quickly after initiation. Storm motions of 50 to 60 mph were common.||During the mid afternoon hours, severe weather was confined to northern Oklahoma. It was there a long track supercell storm produced tornadoes near the Kansas border - including one rated EF3 - from near Wakita to north of Braman.||The capping inversion that had delayed thunderstorm development into central Oklahoma weakened, allowing for explosive supercell development along the dry line along and west of the Interstate 35 corridor. Rapid development and intensification was common with the late afternoon storms, with storms becoming tornadic within a very short time after initiation. This round of storms would directly impact a large part of the Oklahoma City metro area at rush hour, and posed a significant threat to the area. The first tornado in this area occurred in Canadian County.||During the next several hours, tornadoes were clustered around the metro area, and at times there were multiple significant damaging tornadoes occurring simultaneously. Several of the tornadoes had long tracks. Damage from the tornadoes was substantial, with numerous structures, vehicles, trees and power poles/lines significantly damaged or destroyed. One of the more intense tornadoes moved across Lake Thunderbird east of Norman destroying numerous boats.||More storms developed across southwest and south central Oklahoma, and also quickly became tornadic. ||By 9 pm, 35 tornadoes had been reported. While the loss of three lives was tragic, the casualties could have been much higher given the storm's fast motions, their intensity, the time of day and the areas impacted. ||While exact monetary damage figures were not available, it is estimated that losses were in excess of $595 million. At least 450 sustained injuries, most of them minor. Unfortunately three people lost their lives. ||Note: The large number of injuries and tornadoes made it difficult to associate injuries with specific tornadoes. Injury numbers were included when we had confidence in the numbers. ||Note: The complex nature of storm evolutions and interactions made the job of classifying tornadoes difficult. This represents our best scientific assessment based on ground and aerial surveys, data from multiple radars, photographic and video evidence and anecdotal information.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the Grant County portion of tornado #A2. This tornado developed as a multiple-vortex tornado along State Highway 11 southwest of Wakita.  The tornado initially moved east and southeast continuing to affect State Highway 11 before beginning an east-northeast movement across Grant County.  The tornado was a large and occasionally multiple-vortex tornado as it moved northwest and north of Medford and was embedded within a larger scale circulation that was strong enough to produce damage along a wide area around the tornado path.  The tornado caused significant structural damage about 5 miles northwest of Medford and 5 miles east of Renfrow, and many areas of tree and power pole damage.

Tornadoes were most numerous across central and southern Oklahoma, with significant damage occurring over many areas. |Severe thunderstorms erupted by mid afternoon across northern and western Oklahoma.

Storm motions of 50 to 60 mph were common.||During the mid afternoon hours, severe weather was confined to northern Oklahoma. It was there a long track supercell storm produced tornadoes near the Kansas border - including one rated EF3 - from near Wakita to north of Braman.||The capping inversion that had delayed thunderstorm development into central Oklahoma weakened, allowing for explosive supercell development along the dry line along and west of the Interstate 35 corridor. Rapid development and intensification was common with the late afternoon storms, with storms becoming tornadic within a very short time after initiation. This round of storms would directly impact a large part of the Oklahoma City metro area at rush hour, and posed a significant threat to the area. The first tornado in this area occurred in Canadian County.||During the next several hours, tornadoes were clustered around the metro area, and at times there were multiple significant damaging tornadoes occurring simultaneously. Several of the tornadoes had long tracks. Damage from the tornadoes was substantial, with numerous structures, vehicles, trees and power poles/lines significantly damaged or destroyed. One of the more intense tornadoes moved across Lake Thunderbird east of Norman destroying numerous boats.||More storms developed across southwest and south central Oklahoma, and also quickly became tornadic. ||By 9 pm, 35 tornadoes had been reported. While the loss of three lives was tragic, the casualties could have been much higher given the storm's fast motions, their intensity, the time of day and the areas impacted. ||While exact monetary damage figures were not available, it is estimated that losses were in excess of $595 million. At least 450 sustained injuries, most of them minor. Unfortunately three people lost their lives. ||Note: The large number of injuries and tornadoes made it difficult to associate injuries with specific tornadoes.

The damage intensity increased gradually along the path with significant damage beginning as the tornado approached Lake Thunderbird. This tornado crossed Lake Thunderbird, severely damaging two campgrounds and the marina where about 300 boats were docked.  The most severe damage occurred from the Little Axe School to the Cleveland/Pottawatomie county line. Trees were stripped of some bark and branches. Large objects were thrown considerable distances, including some concrete pillars. The metal bleachers near the school were tossed or rolled several hundred yards. Some appliances were also lofted as a dryer was found about 50 feet up in a tree. Considerable structural damage also occurred, as some foundation homes were mostly destroyed.

This resulted in a very warm and humid airmass over northern Ohio.  Outflow boundaries from earlier storms interacted with the stationary front to initiate thunderstorm development during the afternoon hours across inland northern Ohio.  One of the stronger thunderstorms produced tornadoes in Richland and Holmes Counties.  There were also a few reports of straight line thunderstorm wind damage.  A rapidly deepening area of low pressure moved quickly east across southern lower Michigan during the evening hours.  This low eventually moved across Lake Erie during the early morning hours of the 6th.  Showers and thunderstorms developed across northern Indiana during the evening hours.  These storms intensified and moved east along the stationary front and into Northwest Ohio.  A devastating EF4 tornado developed over Wood County a little before midnight.  This tornado moved into Ottawa County before dissipating.  Seven people were killed and dozens of homes destroyed by the tornado.  A weaker tornado also moved across portions of Lucas County.  A third round of storms developed during the early morning hours of the 6th ahead of a cold front trailing the low.  These storms moved across northern Ohio and produced pockets of damage.  An EF1 tornado occurred in Ashtabula County around daybreak.  A total of five tornadoes occurred in northern Ohio on June 5th and 6th.  These tornadoes killed seven people, injured dozens and destroyed or damaged over a 100 homes.  A school and a public administration building were also leveled.  Damage estimates easily topped $100 million.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A devastating tornado moved across portions of northern Wood County during the late evening hours of June 5th.  The tornado reached a peak intensity of EF4 and was responsible for the deaths of seven people.  Five of the victims died immediately with the other two passing away from their injuries at later dates.  The initial touchdown occurred east of Perrysburg along Oregon Road just to the north of the Ohio Turnpike.  The tornado then moved east northeast toward Toledo Metcalf Field as an EF0 to EF1.  The tornado intensified to an EF2 as it crossed East Broadway Street.  Over two dozen homes in a neighborhood bordered by East Broadway to the west and State Route 795 to the north and east were heavily damaged or destroyed.  The worst of the damage was along Shawnee and Neill Avenues in this neighborhood.  The tornado then crossed State Route 795 and followed the highway toward Metcalf Field.  The tornado intensified to EF3 at that time.  Several homes along Moline-Martin Road were destroyed between State Route 795 and Metcalf Field.  An occupant of one of the homes, an 87 year old man, was injured by the tornado and later died.  As the tornado approached Metcalf Field it crossed a railroad yard and overturned a couple dozen railroad cars.  The tornado then moved across the southern end of the airport grounds and destroyed the Lake Township Administrative and Police Department building located just northwest of the intersection of Cummings Road and State Route 795.  A 20 year old female was killed by the tornado just outside of the police department.  She had left her vehicle along with her boyfriend and child to seek refuge in the police station.  She was caught outside and was reportedly killed by flying debris.  At the police station, the tornado destroyed at least six police vehicles and one emergency response vehicle. The emergency response vehicle was found over 1000 feet away from its original position. One police vehicle was found wrapped around a large tree. After doing extensive damage to an agricultural business, the tornado struck the Lake Local School District complex along State Route 795 and Lemoyne Road.  Lake High School took a direct hit from the tornado and was damaged enough to be considered destroyed.  The nearby middle and elementary schools sustained considerable roof damage.  The high school gymnasium was scheduled to hold a commencement ceremony for the graduating senior class on June 6th.  Large sections of the gymnasium collapsed.  A field house, cafeteria and auditorium adjacent to the high school were destroyed.  At least eight school buses were overturned and destroyed by the tornado.  The tornado continued to move parallel to and just north of State Route 795 at EF3 intensity.  A 56 year old female was killed by flying debris while driving her car on State Route 795 near the school complex.  The woman's daughters were following in another car which was also destroyed.  The daughters both sustained minor injuries.  The tornado continued east northeast and crossed Interstate 280 just north of the State Route 795 interchange before moving across open fields for about a mile.  The tornado may have briefly weakened to EF2 intensity, but then strengthened back to EF3 intensity as it crossed Bradner Road to the west of Millbury.  The tornado destroyed several homes in a neighborhood bordered by Bradner Road to the west and Cherry Street to the south.  A 47 year old man was killed in house on Case Road in this neighborhood.  The man's daughter was the valedictorian of the graduating senior class at Lake High School which was destroyed by the tornado.  The tornado then intensified to EF4 as it approached Main Street on the north side of Millbury.  Over a dozen homes were destroyed or heavily damaged along Main Street.  A 36 year old woman and her four year old son were killed in one of the destroyed homes on Main Street.  The woman's 37 year old husband died on June 12th from injuries sustained from the tornado.  Several more homes were destroyed or heavily damaged on Hille Drive and Woodville Road before the tornado crossed North Fostoria Road and moved into Ottawa County as a weak EF3 or strong EF2 tornado.   This tornado was on the ground for around six and a half miles in Wood County and destroyed or heavily damaged over 60 homes.  Dozens of additional homes sustained minor damage with another couple hundred homes affected by the storm.  Dozens of vehicles were also destroyed.  Hundreds of trees were toppled or snapped by the tornado along the damage path which was up to 400 yards in width.  The tornado debarked some of the larger trees along the damage path.  At least one high tension utility pole was toppled by the tornado and widespread power outages occurred in Millbury and Walbridge.   Damage to the Lake Township infrastructure was estimated at five million dollars with tens of millions of losses to the Lake Local School District. The exact number of injuries caused by this tornado is unknown, but at least 17 people had to be hospitalized in nearby Toledo.  Debris from this tornado has been found dozens of miles away, including on some of the islands in western Lake Erie.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This resulted in a very warm and humid airmass over northern Ohio.  Outflow boundaries from earlier storms interacted with the stationary front to initiate thunderstorm development during the afternoon hours across inland northern Ohio.  One of the stronger thunderstorms produced tornadoes in Richland and Holmes Counties.  There were also a few reports of straight line thunderstorm wind damage.  A rapidly deepening area of low pressure moved quickly east across southern lower Michigan during the evening hours.  This low eventually moved across Lake Erie during the early morning hours of the 6th.  Showers and thunderstorms developed across northern Indiana during the evening hours.  These storms intensified and moved east along the stationary front and into Northwest Ohio.  A devastating EF4 tornado developed over Wood County a little before midnight.  This tornado moved into Ottawa County before dissipating.  Seven people were killed and dozens of homes destroyed by the tornado.  A weaker tornado also moved across portions of Lucas County.  A third round of storms developed during the early morning hours of the 6th ahead of a cold front trailing the low.  These storms moved across northern Ohio and produced pockets of damage.  An EF1 tornado occurred in Ashtabula County around daybreak.  A total of five tornadoes occurred in northern Ohio on June 5th and 6th.  These tornadoes killed seven people, injured dozens and destroyed or damaged over a 100 homes.  A school and a public administration building were also leveled.  Damage estimates easily topped $100 million.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A devastating tornado moved across portions of northern Wood County during the late evening hours of June 5th.  The tornado reached a peak intensity of EF4 and was responsible for the deaths of seven people.  Five of the victims died immediately with the other two passing away from their injuries at later dates.  The initial touchdown occurred east of Perrysburg along Oregon Road just to the north of the Ohio Turnpike.  The tornado then moved east northeast toward Toledo Metcalf Field as an EF0 to EF1.  The tornado intensified to an EF2 as it crossed East Broadway Street.  Over two dozen homes in a neighborhood bordered by East Broadway to the west and State Route 795 to the north and east were heavily damaged or destroyed.  The worst of the damage was along Shawnee and Neill Avenues in this neighborhood.  The tornado then crossed State Route 795 and followed the highway toward Metcalf Field.  The tornado intensified to EF3 at that time.  Several homes along Moline-Martin Road were destroyed between State Route 795 and Metcalf Field.  An occupant of one of the homes, an 87 year old man, was injured by the tornado and later died.  As the tornado approached Metcalf Field it crossed a railroad yard and overturned a couple dozen railroad cars.  The tornado then moved across the southern end of the airport grounds and destroyed the Lake Township Administrative and Police Department building located just northwest of the intersection of Cummings Road and State Route 795.  A 20 year old female was killed by the tornado just outside of the police department.  She had left her vehicle along with her boyfriend and child to seek refuge in the police station.  She was caught outside and was reportedly killed by flying debris.  At the police station, the tornado destroyed at least six police vehicles and one emergency response vehicle. The emergency response vehicle was found over 1000 feet away from its original position. One police vehicle was found wrapped around a large tree. After doing extensive damage to an agricultural business, the tornado struck the Lake Local School District complex along State Route 795 and Lemoyne Road.  Lake High School took a direct hit from the tornado and was damaged enough to be considered destroyed.  The nearby middle and elementary schools sustained considerable roof damage.  The high school gymnasium was scheduled to hold a commencement ceremony for the graduating senior class on June 6th.  Large sections of the gymnasium collapsed.  A field house, cafeteria and auditorium adjacent to the high school were destroyed.  At least eight school buses were overturned and destroyed by the tornado.  The tornado continued to move parallel to and just north of State Route 795 at EF3 intensity.  A 56 year old female was killed by flying debris while driving her car on State Route 795 near the school complex.  The woman's daughters were following in another car which was also destroyed.  The daughters both sustained minor injuries.  The tornado continued east northeast and crossed Interstate 280 just north of the State Route 795 interchange before moving across open fields for about a mile.  The tornado may have briefly weakened to EF2 intensity, but then strengthened back to EF3 intensity as it crossed Bradner Road to the west of Millbury.  The tornado destroyed several homes in a neighborhood bordered by Bradner Road to the west and Cherry Street to the south.  A 47 year old man was killed in house on Case Road in this neighborhood.  The man's daughter was the valedictorian of the graduating senior class at Lake High School which was destroyed by the tornado.  The tornado then intensified to EF4 as it approached Main Street on the north side of Millbury.  Over a dozen homes were destroyed or heavily damaged along Main Street.  A 36 year old woman and her four year old son were killed in one of the destroyed homes on Main Street.  The woman's 37 year old husband died on June 12th from injuries sustained from the tornado.  Several more homes were destroyed or heavily damaged on Hille Drive and Woodville Road before the tornado crossed North Fostoria Road and moved into Ottawa County as a weak EF3 or strong EF2 tornado.   This tornado was on the ground for around six and a half miles in Wood County and destroyed or heavily damaged over 60 homes.  Dozens of additional homes sustained minor damage with another couple hundred homes affected by the storm.  Dozens of vehicles were also destroyed.  Hundreds of trees were toppled or snapped by the tornado along the damage path which was up to 400 yards in width.  The tornado debarked some of the larger trees along the damage path.  At least one high tension utility pole was toppled by the tornado and widespread power outages occurred in Millbury and Walbridge.   Damage to the Lake Township infrastructure was estimated at five million dollars with tens of millions of losses to the Lake Local School District. The exact number of injuries caused by this tornado is unknown, but at least 17 people had to be hospitalized in nearby Toledo.  Debris from this tornado has been found dozens of miles away, including on some of the islands in western Lake Erie.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Severe periods of severe weather occurred in the afternoon and evening before it became more of a heavy rainfall, and flash flooding event. Several reports of tornadoes, wind damage and large hail occurred from west-central Minnesota, through south central, and east-central Minnesota.  A tornado occurred in the town of Farmington, Minnesota during the odd hour of 3 am.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A Storm Survey determined that an EF-1 tornado tracked to the northeast from three miles northwest of Farmington, to 3.3 miles north of Farmington, Minnesota. ||The damage consisted of the following; ||A few homes had large sections of roof structure removed. Numerous homes had significant roof damage, with loss of vinyl or metal siding. In addtion, numerous garage doors had collapsed or were pushed inward. One home had their entire garage shifted off its foundation by over 5 inches. Another home had their entire garage collapse, only leaving the main home intact. Due to several structures that had their foundations shifted and walls completely blown down, this tornado was rated a high end EF-1, which is approximately 105 mph. Most of the tornado damage was high end EF-0, or low end EF-1, or approximately 70 to 90 mph. Hundreds of trees were either uprooted or blown down. Several trees had diameters in excess of 30 inches.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 750.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The supercell thunderstorm developed strong rotation, and rotating wall clouds and brief funnel clouds were reported in Daniels County.  As the storm moved southeast, it intensified and a large, long-lived tornado formed.  The tornado traveled for 18 miles, mostly through rural areas, but it had devastating impacts as it hit a ranch, killing two people and injuring one.   On the morning of July 27th, 2010 two teams of NWS Glasgow staff surveyed the damage area.  The first team started in Daniels County and followed the track of the storm to the east-southeast.   The second team met with county and state officials at the site of the ranch that was most devastated.   Both teams spoke to law enforcement officials, as well as weather spotters and the public who had reports of weather and/or damage as well as those who saw the tornado.   ||The initial damage from the tornado originated about 12 miles south of Redstone.   Along the Reserve and Wanso Roads, six miles of power lines were snapped off.  Sheridan Electric was able to restore power fairly quickly to the majority of residences by the next morning.  Due to the poles being snapped, the tornado was rated an EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale in this area.   This was the widest portion of the tornado track with a width of a half mile.||The tornado continued east-southeast where it encountered an abandoned farmhouse, a barn and a bridge that went across Wolf Creek on the Three Corners Road.  The bridge had the planks ripped off with damage totals coming to $100,000.  The farmhouse was blown off of the foundation, had some of the siding stripped off, and roof damage.  The barn was completely destroyed, with the west and north facing walls blown away, and the south and east facing walls intact for the most part, but flattened on the ground.  Two grain bins were destroyed, with a third still on its foundation but crushed.  They appeared to be empty.   The damage at this location was rated an EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  The width of the tornado at this point was a quarter mile wide. ||The storm continued on its east-southeast track at a speed of about 30 mph.  The Smith Ranch was then impacted.  The ranch sits on a bit of a hill with a small stream valley from the west-northwest to just north of the property.  There are no shelter belts or terrain to block some of the winds from the tornado.  The two fatalities and one injury occurred at the Smith Ranch.  The adult fatality was trying to get into the basement.  The child fatality was in the basement and the chimney collapsed and crushed him.  The adult injury was with the child, but on the other side of the chimney in the basement. ||The tornado was rated an EF3 at the Smith Ranch, with a width of three tenths of a mile.  This was the highest rating during the life cycle of the tornado.  Along with the devastating destruction of property, there was also up to 40 cows and calves significantly injured or killed by the tornado and/or debris.

Southwest flow aloft was in place across the Northern Plains region, ahead of an upper level trough over the Northern Rockies. A potent upper level impulse ejecting from the base of the trough provided the trigger for two areas of strong to severe convection. The first area was near a stationary boundary across southern North Dakota, where intense thunderstorm winds of 80 to near 100 mph were observed. The second area was ahead of a cold front over north central North Dakota, where an isolated tornadic supercell developed and spawned an EF3 tornado near Bowbells. ||Well into this event, Severe Thunderstorm Watch number 605 was issued across southwest and south central North Dakota in anticipation of a Mesoscale Convective System over southwest North Dakota tracking eastward along the South Dakota border area.  By the time of the watch issuance, the tornadic supercell over north central North Dakota had dissipated.||Multiple severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings were issued. Several reports of large hail, numerous reports of strong thunderstorm winds, and one confirmed EF3 tornado was received during this episode. ||The EF3 tornado tragically claimed one fatality.  An automobile traveling east on Highway 52 was picked up and carried several hundred yards before being thrown into a field. Another person in the car was injured. In addition, a farmstead sustained heavy damage from the tornado, with severe damage observed to the home and several outbuildings.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado crossed from Burke County into Ward County. Note that for roughly three miles in the vicinity of the Des Lacs River, U.S. Highway 52 runs right on the Burke and Ward County line. The tornado was right on the highway in this area. This was the location of the worst damage with this tornado. Farm property on the north side of the highway, Burke County, and on the south side of the highway, Ward County, was impacted. One fatality and one injury occurred here, in a single automobile travelling along the highway, on the county line. The vehicle came to rest in a field, nearly 200 yards off the highway, on the south side of the highway, on the east side of the river, in Ward County. See the EF3 tornado entry for Burke County from August 12.||This third tornado touched down just northeast of Bowbells, Burke County, and tracked east-southeast along U.S. Highway 52, and into Ward County where it dissipated. This EF3 tornado was spawned from the same supercell thunderstorm that earlier produced two brief and weak tornadoes in Burke County.||Meteorologists from the National Weather Service conducted a storm damage survey on Friday, August 13, 2010. Meteorologists walked through the area and spoke with numerous people affected, some of whom were eye witnesses to the event.||Significant damage occurred nearly six miles east of Bowbells, near the Des Lacs River, where U.S. Highway 52 is on the Burke and Ward County line. Three farms were impacted. The worst damage was on the Burke County side of the highway and west side of the river, where a farm home (DI 2, DOD 8) and six outbuildings were destroyed. Nineteen of 21 grain bins were also damaged or destroyed. In addition, a fifty foot air seeder connected to a cultivator, with a combined estimated weight near 60,000 pounds, was moved approximately 100 yards. Based on a lack of scratch marks in the ground it was determined that this equipment was picked up and carried through the air. A second farm, on the Ward County side of the highway, had trees in shelter belts snapped and uprooted and the chimney on the house damaged. A third house, this one on the east side of the river and the Ward County side of the highway, also had significant damage. Here, one camper was thrown into the river on the south side of the Highway 52 bridge that crosses the river, while another camper was thrown into the river and landed on the north side of the bridge, back into Burke County. The house had damage to siding and shingles.||Of all the damage surveyed the absolute worst corresponded to a high EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Tornado Scale. From that it was determined that peak wind speeds in the tornado were on the order of 165 mph.||One fatality and one injury occurred in an automobile in this same immediate area. A car with two occupants travelling east along U.S. Highway 52 was picked up and carried over the Des Lacs River, and came to rest 200 yards off the highway, in a field east of the river, and on the Ward County side of the highway. The driver of the vehicle was injured and the passenger was killed.||See the other three tornado entries for Burke County from this event on August 12.

The setup featured a 45 knot mid level flow and a 95 knot upper level jet.  Matter of fact, a larger area of showers, associated with a warm front, had moved across southeast Ohio and West Virginia during the morning and midday hours.

A greater swath of tree and structural damage was along Otterbein Road.  The damage path widened to as much as 800 yards, though the southern portion of the path was dominant.  The tornado unleashed it worst winds as it continued east to encounter Palomino Road and County Township Road 138.  At this stage, there was aproximately a 1 mile long and 100 yard wide path of EF2 strength winds, estimated at 110 to 120 mph.

The woman inside was injured when a hallway door struck her in the back.  There were at least 2 eyewitnesses to the actual tornado.  Almost a mile east on County Township Road 138 a cluster of houses was heavily damaged.  The worst damage was a newer 2 story single family home, but seemed to be of the manufactured home quality.  Its roof and garage were completely blown off and thrown away.   The tornado began to weaken as it headed across County Road 25.

The setup featured a 45 knot mid level flow and a 95 knot upper level jet.  Matter of fact, a larger area of showers, associated with a warm front, had moved across southeast Ohio and West Virginia during the morning and midday hours. This kept the surface based instability at a minimum.  However, new cells formed further west during the mid afternoon over western Ohio.  It was this new cluster of convection that would intensify due to the strong mid and upper level dynamics.  Several of the new cells formed and intensified on the southern or southwestern flank of the overall larger area of showers and thunderstorms.  This area of convection stretched further to the northeast into eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania.  This allowed an unimpeded low level moisture inflow into the new development.  Surface dew points ahead of the cold front reached into the mid 60s.||Most of the severe thunderstorms exhibited strong rotation, resulting in the spawning of 5 tornadoes.  Four of these 5 tornadoes were in southeast Ohio.  One of the 4 Ohio tornadoes crossed from Fairfield County into western Perry County.   Another 1 of the 4 crossed from Perry into northwestern Morgan County.  One tornado patch was solely in Athens County.  Finally, the last of the 4 tornadoes in Ohio crossed the Ohio River from northeastern Meigs County into southern Wood County in West Virginia.  This tornado was the strongest and resulted in a fatality on the West Virginia side of the Ohio River.  The last direct death from a tornado in West Virginnia was back in June of 1982.  Finally, the last short tornado path in this outbreak was solely in western West Virginia, located in Wirt County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado originated in northeastern Meigs County Ohio and crossed the Ohio River, just upstream of the lock and dam and the community of Belleville.  A small pocket of EF3 damage located along Route 68 in the valley and flood plain along the river.  The maximum wind gusts were estimated at 160 mph here.  Also, the width of the tornado briefly widened to 500 yards here.  Well built single family homes received major damage or were destroyed.  In this area, a 57 year old male was killed.  He, his wife, and their dog had gone downstairs into the basement for protection.  The husband went back upstair to get a flashlight.  He figured the electricity would go out, as darkness had already set in.  At that point, he disappeared as the tornado hit.  His wife tried to open the door to let him back down, but she could not open the door. Their ranch style home with a brick front was destroyed.  His body was found some 150 to 200 feet away in a field.  Ten other people were injured, but none seriously.  Other significant structural and tree damage occurred along a river access road and basically along the South Fork of Lee Creek drainage toward Rockport.  The total path length of this tornado from Meigs County Ohio into Wood County was over 9 miles.   All total, the county reported 10 homes destroyed, 6 homes with major damage, and 27 homes with minor damage.  About 15 to 18 outbuildings were damaged or destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A vigorous upper level disturbance helped to support deep vertical motions in the atmosphere, along with strong deep layer wind shear.  This lift acted on a warm and very moist atmosphere, carried into the region on a 40 to 50 knot low-level jet.  The result was powerful rotating thunderstorms, with damaging straight line winds, large hail, and in this case, 5 tornadoes.  At one point during the height of the event, around 48,000 customers in southeast Wisconsin were without electric power due to downed power lines.  However, power-line and power-pole loss estimates were not available and do not show up as damage amounts in any individual event within this severe weather episode.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF2 tornado developed about 1.9 miles west-southwest of the Village of Eagle, roughly 1/2 mile south-southeast of the intersection of STH 59 and CTH S, just west of CTH S and west of a horse-riding ranch, and moved east-northeast through the Eagle and then moved due east and then east-southeast before dissipating about 1.94 miles southeast of Jericho, just within Mukwonago County Park, 1000 feet east of Genevieve Drive.  Fifteen people sustained minor injuries.  One hundred thirty-four homes received minor damage, 67 homes had major damage, and 8 homes were destroyed, mainly in the southern part of the village.  Another 75 homes were minimally affected.  One business received major damage, while 18 businesses had minor damage.  The business that received major damage was a commercial horse-riding ranch/western town at the beginning of the tornado path.  Damage was inflicted upon all of the fencing, two trolleys, and 18 tables.  One of the biggest buildings on the site was twisted and turned.  A donkey was killed, four hayride wagons were lost, and 25 acres of trees were damaged.  The owner of the riding ranch saw the tornado and said it looked like the Fourth of July fireworks finale - there were thousands of lightning streaks in the cone.  All together, this tornado uprooted or damaged thousands of trees, and at least three dozen vehicles were damaged or totaled.  At Old World Wisconsin, an outdoor museum operated by the Wisconsin Historical Society near Eagle, about 2500 tress were damaged at this site alone, and a few buildings sustained minor damage.  Overall, Emergency Management officials estimated that residential damage reached $20,577,500, with business damage around $311,500, bringing total private sector damage to about $20,889,000.  A few agricultural buildings were damaged, but loss estimates were not available.  Public sector structural damage totaled only about $600, while public sector service costs (non-damage) such as debris clean-up, security and public protection, road protective measures, and other miscellaneous expenses were estimated at $101,965. The starting point location was Lat. 42.86785 Lon.-88.50307. The end point location was Lat.42.87100 Lon. -88.40003. The EF-rating was based on DI 2 (FR12) DOD 6 which suggests wind speeds between 125 to 130 mph.  On the WSR-88D Doppler radar at the nearby WFO Milwaukee (MKX), a debris-ball appeared near Eagle within a classic hook echo as the parent thunderstorm moved east.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.60M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

On N 2200 E Road, 0.3 miles south of IL Route 17, a farm house sustained damage to windows, siding, and shingles, with many trees uprooted or damaged. Outbuildings were also damaged. The tornado at this point was rated EF1, with a path width of 70 yards.  Debris from this farm was spread 200 yards wide across the field at N 2300E Road.  ||The tornado proceeded to strike the golf course at N 2400 E Road, where numerous large trees were snapped and uprooted. Golf cart sheds were unroofed or severely damaged.  At this point the tornado was rated low end EF2 with a path width of 300 yards.  The tornado then moved east across Interstate 55 and moved into Dwight, damaging a lumber yard and other businesses.  At Williams Street and old Route 66 a mobile home park was hit.  Fourteen people were injured. One person who was seriously injured, later died. At the mobile home park, 35 mobile homes were destroyed.  Damage here was rated EF2.  Large trees were uprooted and power poles were snapped at the railroad tracks.  At a ball field a little farther east, trees and fences were damaged and an announcer's booth was destroyed.  Slightly farther east, there was minor damage to a church, but the church's garage was destroyed. There was damage to the high school auditorium roof and facade, and a greenhouse.  A storage garage was destroyed at the high school.  ||The tornado then continued east into a subdivision between Philmar Street and Prospect Avenue, where many large trees were downed on top of homes.  At Sunset Drive and Wilmac Street a garage door and roof were taken off.  A roof was taken off a house on Linden Street a half block west of Il Route 47.  Three houses were uninhabitable and had to be destroyed. More than 100 homes had some damage. Damage in Dwight was rated high end EF1 to low end EF2.

Very large hail also accompanied some tornadoes along with flash flooding.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado initially moved northeast to approximately 3.5 miles west of Conger, where at about (43.6156, -93.6015), it began to move more to the east-northeast. West of Armstrong, at about (43.6597, -93.4938), it began tracking nearly due north to just west of Manchester, where at about (43.7357, -93.4801), it began to move to the north-northwest, before dissipating 1.5 miles west of Hartland.  Accounting for the changes in direction of this track, the actual path length covered by the tornado was 19.95 miles.||Near 180th Street and County Road 2, a home was likely in the outer circulation of the tornado, as it sustained some roof and siding damage.  A barn was also destroyed to its brick foundation and a car was also flipped over lengthwise. Some evidence of tree debarking was noted.  The tornado continued to the northeast and caused extensive crop damage approximately 500 yards in width. Near County Roads 17 and 63, the tornado intensified to produce EF-3 damage, impacting a farmstead and causing the complete destruction of three swine barns and the loss of 12 head of swine. Two empty grain bins were completely blown away at this location. The house at this location had some roof damage but appeared to be northwest of the main tornado path. Approximately 100 feet northeast of the house, a 150 foot tripod style wind turbine tower was twisted and toppled. This location also marked the beginning of crops being completely raked, with only stalks of corn left, and soybean fields being almost unrecognizable.||After passing through this farmstead the tornado took a more easterly path across County Road 63, and maintained EF-3 strength. After passing County Road 63, another farmstead was hit, and two empty harvester silos were toppled.  The tornado continued to the northeast across County Road 4, where continued raking of the fields was noted with significant deposition of debris along the tornado path. Numerous trees were toppled at County Road 89 where it turns to the north. The tornado continued to the north-northeast, grew to 1000 yards, and around 1750 LST impacted a farmstead along County Road 12 two miles north of Conger, where EF-4 damage was observed. The house at this location was completely destroyed, as was the barn and several other buildings. Extensive tree damage was noted with nearly all branches being removed from the trunks.  Debarking of trees was widespread at this location. A car was also tumbled a distance of 3200 feet, coming to rest in a field east of County Road 12.||The tornado continued to the northeast across County Road 69 and County Road 46, where it weakened slightly to EF-3 intensity. As it crossed County Road 46, a house was rotated off the foundation. The tornado was approximately 700 yards wide at this point. To the north-northeast, a swine barn was destroyed with sheet metal being carried off to Interstate 90. At this same time, a satellite tornado developed and caused damage in the town of Armstrong (see separate entry).||The main tornado continued to the north-northeast and was 500 yards in width. The tornado crossed County Road 74 and caused EF-2 damage to three farmsteads. One farmstead with a manufactured home was hit, resulting in one fatality and one severe injury.  The tornado crossed Interstate 90 just west of County Road 14 as it grew to one third of a mile in width and re-strengthened to EF-3 intensity. Several farmsteads saw significant damage between Sugar Lake and County Road 14, with a house and two barns completely destroyed. From this point the tornado continued to the north, growing to one mile in width. Around 1800 LST, a house and barn were destroyed approximately one mile west of Manchester on County Road 25, where extensive tree and structural damage was also noted at several properties in the area. Additionally, west of this tornadic damage, a separate area of tree and structural damage was caused by strong thunderstorm winds associated with a rear flank downdraft (see separate entry).||About one mile north, the tornado weakened slightly to EF-2 Intensity, where it damaged three full grain bins near County Road 29. The tornado was approximately 1300 yards at this point.  Further north, at County Road 95, the tornado continued to weaken, although a farmstead still received EF-1 damage to trees and structures.  Finally, the tornado continued north and began to narrow and weaken. It dissipated west of Hartland. One person was killed and 14 injured from this tornado.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Very large hail also accompanied some tornadoes along with flash flooding.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado initially moved northeast to approximately 3.5 miles west of Conger, where at about (43.6156, -93.6015), it began to move more to the east-northeast. West of Armstrong, at about (43.6597, -93.4938), it began tracking nearly due north to just west of Manchester, where at about (43.7357, -93.4801), it began to move to the north-northwest, before dissipating 1.5 miles west of Hartland.  Accounting for the changes in direction of this track, the actual path length covered by the tornado was 19.95 miles.||Near 180th Street and County Road 2, a home was likely in the outer circulation of the tornado, as it sustained some roof and siding damage.  A barn was also destroyed to its brick foundation and a car was also flipped over lengthwise. Some evidence of tree debarking was noted.  The tornado continued to the northeast and caused extensive crop damage approximately 500 yards in width. Near County Roads 17 and 63, the tornado intensified to produce EF-3 damage, impacting a farmstead and causing the complete destruction of three swine barns and the loss of 12 head of swine. Two empty grain bins were completely blown away at this location. The house at this location had some roof damage but appeared to be northwest of the main tornado path. Approximately 100 feet northeast of the house, a 150 foot tripod style wind turbine tower was twisted and toppled. This location also marked the beginning of crops being completely raked, with only stalks of corn left, and soybean fields being almost unrecognizable.||After passing through this farmstead the tornado took a more easterly path across County Road 63, and maintained EF-3 strength. After passing County Road 63, another farmstead was hit, and two empty harvester silos were toppled.  The tornado continued to the northeast across County Road 4, where continued raking of the fields was noted with significant deposition of debris along the tornado path. Numerous trees were toppled at County Road 89 where it turns to the north. The tornado continued to the north-northeast, grew to 1000 yards, and around 1750 LST impacted a farmstead along County Road 12 two miles north of Conger, where EF-4 damage was observed. The house at this location was completely destroyed, as was the barn and several other buildings. Extensive tree damage was noted with nearly all branches being removed from the trunks.  Debarking of trees was widespread at this location. A car was also tumbled a distance of 3200 feet, coming to rest in a field east of County Road 12.||The tornado continued to the northeast across County Road 69 and County Road 46, where it weakened slightly to EF-3 intensity. As it crossed County Road 46, a house was rotated off the foundation. The tornado was approximately 700 yards wide at this point. To the north-northeast, a swine barn was destroyed with sheet metal being carried off to Interstate 90. At this same time, a satellite tornado developed and caused damage in the town of Armstrong (see separate entry).||The main tornado continued to the north-northeast and was 500 yards in width. The tornado crossed County Road 74 and caused EF-2 damage to three farmsteads. One farmstead with a manufactured home was hit, resulting in one fatality and one severe injury.  The tornado crossed Interstate 90 just west of County Road 14 as it grew to one third of a mile in width and re-strengthened to EF-3 intensity. Several farmsteads saw significant damage between Sugar Lake and County Road 14, with a house and two barns completely destroyed. From this point the tornado continued to the north, growing to one mile in width. Around 1800 LST, a house and barn were destroyed approximately one mile west of Manchester on County Road 25, where extensive tree and structural damage was also noted at several properties in the area. Additionally, west of this tornadic damage, a separate area of tree and structural damage was caused by strong thunderstorm winds associated with a rear flank downdraft (see separate entry).||About one mile north, the tornado weakened slightly to EF-2 Intensity, where it damaged three full grain bins near County Road 29. The tornado was approximately 1300 yards at this point.  Further north, at County Road 95, the tornado continued to weaken, although a farmstead still received EF-1 damage to trees and structures.  Finally, the tornado continued north and began to narrow and weaken. It dissipated west of Hartland. One person was killed and 14 injured from this tornado.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It damaged two doors of the Sturtevant Fire Department, damaged the roofs and windows of two homes, uprooted a tree that crashed through another home, and knocked over another tree that damage a truck.  One person was injured when the tornado winds rushed into her home and pushed her three feet against a banister.  Numerous vehicles in a WalMart parking lot had broken windows from airborne debris.  It overturned, moved, and slightly damaged two trailers about 50 yards at a local business where it also snapped 3 light poles. At least two to three dozen trees were uprooted or had broken limbs. The beginning and ending lat/lon pairs of numbers were: 42.70306/-87.91533 and 42.68797/-8782715. The EF-rating was based on DI 27 (FR12), DOD3 EXP, which suggests maximum wind speeds about 95 to 100 mph.||Elsewhere, rear flank downdraft winds from the storm produced scattered minor damage over the extreme southeast corner of Racine County and  northeast Kenosha County. The thunderstorm may also have produced a waterspout as it moved out over Lake Michigan about 1 mile north-northeast of the intersection of State Highway 32 and County Highway KR.

The tornado produced EF1 damage as it moved east-southeast through the northern part of Sturtevant.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado spun up just northwest of the village of Sturtevant just northwest of the intersection of STH 11 and Wisconsin St., and moved east-southeast through the northern part of the village before dissipating in the  Elmwood Park area near the intersection of Taylor Ave and Meachem Rd.  It damaged two doors of the Sturtevant Fire Department, damaged the roofs and windows of two homes, uprooted a tree that crashed through another home, and knocked over another tree that damage a truck.  One person was injured when the tornado winds rushed into her home and pushed her three feet against a banister.  Numerous vehicles in a WalMart parking lot had broken windows from airborne debris.  It overturned, moved, and slightly damaged two trailers about 50 yards at a local business where it also snapped 3 light poles. At least two to three dozen trees were uprooted or had broken limbs. The beginning and ending lat/lon pairs of numbers were: 42.70306/-87.91533 and 42.68797/-8782715. The EF-rating was based on DI 27 (FR12), DOD3 EXP, which suggests maximum wind speeds about 95 to 100 mph.||Elsewhere, rear flank downdraft winds from the storm produced scattered minor damage over the extreme southeast corner of Racine County and  northeast Kenosha County. The thunderstorm may also have produced a waterspout as it moved out over Lake Michigan about 1 mile north-northeast of the intersection of State Highway 32 and County Highway KR.

Numerous impacts were felt in the region, with heavy rain, wind damage, and hail. ||The most severe weather took place in portions of eastern Kansas and western Missouri, as a strong bow echo moved through the area near and just after the midnight hour.  Embedded in this bow echo were small features called meso-vortices, which can often times cause local intensifications of the strong straightline winds, or even produce weak spinnup tornadoes.  One such feature embedded in a smaller bowing storm segment south of the Plattsburg area, led to reports of a damaged greenhouse, tree damage, as well as damage to other nearby structures.  It was determined, that a combination of enhanced straight line winds as well as a very brief and weak (EF0) tornado, produced winds as high as 70 to 85 mph in this area.  Further to the south, strong straight line winds, also blew over trees and caused other forms of property damage, to fences and homes in areas around Kansas City. Several observations of 60 to 70 mph winds were observed in the area. ||However, the biggest impact from this event, was the persistent heavy rain due to the training of storms over the same areas.  The hardest hit areas were in the Kirksville and Chillicothe areas, where rainfall totals in the 3 to 6 inch range were common.  Elsewhere, while rainfall amounts may have been lower, the rapid rainfall rates in excess of 2 per hour, caused localized flash flooding in portions of the Kansas City Metropoitan area and elsewhere. The heavy rains caused many rivers and creeks to go out of their banks.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flash flooding caused pavement over a culvert to give way. This caused the front end of a vehicle, to fall through the roadway. While attempting to get out of the vehicle, a 32 year old male, was swept away by the current and drowned.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Numerous homes and cars were flooded. One person died, and at least 136 people were injured. Damage was estimated at $5.5 million in Oklahoma county alone.||The event began late on June 13th, as thunderstorms developed over northwest Oklahoma. The thunderstorms developed ahead of a slow moving cold front that was located over southwest Kansas into the northern Texas panhandle. A large outflow boundary also extended eastward. The thunderstorms became more numerous as they moved along the outflow boundary.  Strengthened by the new rainfall, the outflow boundary dropped toward central Oklahoma, and a very moist low-level jet resulted in new thunderstorm development near the boundary.||The first round of significant rain impacted central Oklahoma around 3 am. This round moved east before another, longer lived, thunderstorm complex developed over the Oklahoma City metro area. The outflow boundary was located south of Interstate 40, and the low-level jet transported warm and unseasonably humid air north of the boundary, creating very heavy rain. Thunderstorms continued to develop over the southwest metro area, and slowly moved northeast. Rainfall rates averaged one to two inches per hour, with some thunderstorm bands producing rates near three inches per hour.||The heavy rain accumulated quickly immediately before and during the busy morning drive time. Numerous cars became stranded in the rapidly rising water. Roadways were covered by rapidly flowing water, and ponds, creeks, and rivers easily spilled over their banks. Navigating in and around the metro area became almost impossible, and many motorists had to be rescued by boat. After several hours, the persistent heavy rainfall tapered off around noon.||The larger area of heavy rainfall moved south as the outflow boundary moved into southern Oklahoma. Significant rain developed over southwest Oklahoma by early afternoon, and flash flooding once again became a problem. Lawton was hard hit, receiving between four and five inches of rain, resulting in several roadways becoming flooded. Numerous motorists had to be rescued from the high water. One motorist, unfortunately, lost his life when his vehicle stalled in flood waters.||Thunderstorms developed again over central Oklahoma late in the afternoon and evening, but luckily the duration of the thunderstorms was relatively short. By the time it was all said and done, widespread totals of five to nine inches were reported over much of Oklahoma City. Will Rogers World Airport reported its largest daily precipitation since records began in 1891, with 7.62 inches. Even higher totals were reported over the north-central portion of Oklahoma City, where nine to twelve inches was measured.||Strong winds caused some power outages during the event. At the peak of the event, over 6700 people were without power. Isolated pockets of wind damage did occur, with a power pole/power lines downed south of Drummond in Garfield county.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous roads were closed due to high water. Several motorists had to be rescued after their automobiles stalled in the high water. One person drowned while trying to push his car out of the high water near NW Farris and 13th Street.

Twenty-one of those roads and 14 bridges were washed out as a result of the flooding. Other roads received damage just from the heavy rain. Damage was particularly bad in Atoka and Mason. Numerous vehicles were completely submerged in water. Two apartment complexes in Covington sustained major damage. In total, 309 homes received damage from the flooding. Of those, 96 homes were completely destroyed. As many as 93 businesses were flooded and of those 21 were completely destroyed. Nineteen mobile homes were flooded with 14 being destroyed. Many other structures or buildings were flooded as well. One fatality occurred in Mason. The flash flooding event transitioned into a flood event as rivers rose rapidly and overflowed their banks.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

CAPE rose to 3500-4500 J/kg by the mid to late afternoon with lifted indices of -8 to -10 C.  The moisture pooled over the state with precipitable water values approaching 2 inches by evening.  High temperatures reached the upper 80s to low 90s, with dewpoints topping out in the upper 70s to low 80s.  The atmosphere was fairly weakly sheared with 30 kts of available shear.  Downdraft CAPE was between 1000 and 1800 J/kg.  Available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was 800-1100 J/kg, but hail was limited by the high freezing level, 16,000 to 16,500 feet.  Quarter size hail fell in Calhoun County as an intense storm passed though.  The same storm cluster produced a funnel cloud in Sac County earlier.  Scattered winds occurred with the storms.  A 61 MPH wind gust was recorded in Eagle Grove for example and windows were blown out in Humboldt County south of Thor.  One of the thunderstorms produced a tornado in Emmet County.  The tornado touched down briefly over Lake Iowa.  Thunderstorms became more organized during the evening and produced very heavy rainfall.  In addition to the rainfall, scattered reports of high winds and some hail up to an inch and one quarter in size were received.  Most of the wind reports were around 60 MPH.  By far the most significant weather was the heavy rainfall.  Three to 5 inches of rain fell on saturated ground, resulting in a very widespread flash flood event.  Nearly half of the CWA was involved from parts of north central Iowa south to the Missouri border.  Numerous roads were covered with flowing water of 1 to 2 feet in depth.  Lightning struck a car at mile post 105 on Interstate 35 in Story County.  No injuries were reported.  Lightning also struck a house in Ankeny, causing a fire.  The flash flooding claimed one life in central Iowa.   Three vehicles were swept into the waters of Mud Creek near Altoona in Polk County.  There were 11 people involved.  A rescue call was made to save the occupants of the cars.  One 16 year old female perished in the flood waters, the other 10 were rescued, though 4 were injured and received treatment at a local hospital.  The flash flooding transitioned into widespread flooding as the night progressed into the day of the 11th.  Flash flooding resulted in evacuations of apartments and trailer courts on the east side of Des Moines.  Interstate 35 was covered by water due to flash flooding at mile post 97.  Several cars spun out in the flood waters.  Very intense rainfall in the Ames area resulted in a record crest on Squaw Creek.  The creek crested 1.5 to 2.5 feet above the record high stage.  Major flooding took place and the water treatment plant was inundated.  Major damage was done to several buildings on the Iowa State Campus.  Damage to Iowa State alone was between $40,000,000 and $50,000,000.  Flooding from the Skunk River closed U.S. Highway 30.  Thirty people were rescued at a Wal-Mart store in Ames as well.  Following the severe flooding, several Iowa counties were added to the Presidential Disaster Declaration number 1930.  The original 32 were: Adams, Appanoose, Audubon, Buena Vista, Butler, Cherokee, Clay, Davis, Decatur, Franklin, Howard, Humboldt, Iowa, Lee, Lyon, Madison, Marion, Mills, Monroe, Montgomery, O���Brien, Osceola, Palo Alto, Ringgold, Shelby, Union, Van Buren, Wapello, Warren, Wayne, Webster and Wright.  Eighteen were added to the original, incuding: Black Hawk, Boone, Buchanan, Clayton, Delaware, Dickinson, Dubuque, Emmet, Fayette, Guthrie, Jackson, Jasper, Jones, Lucas, Mahaska, Polk, Sioux and Story.  In addition, Governor Chet Culver had issued disaster proclamations for 50 Iowa counties due to inclement weather since June 1, 2010: Appanoose, Black Hawk, Boone, Buchanan, Buena Vista, Butler, Cherokee, Clay, Clayton, Davis, Decatur, Delaware, Dickinson, Dubuque, Emmet, Fayette, Franklin, Hamilton, Hancock, Howard, Humboldt, Jackson, Jasper, Jefferson, Johnson, Jones, Kossuth, Lee, Lucas, Lyon, Mahaska, Marion, Monona, Monroe, O'Brien, Osceola, Palo Alto, Polk, Ringgold, Shelby, Sioux, Story, Taylor, Union, Van Buren, Wapello, Warren, Washington, Webster and Wright.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Water rescue in progress regarding three vehicles with a total of 11 people near NE 8th Ave and NE 54th Ave.  There was one fatality, 10 rescues and several injuries.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

During the afternoon, a persistent band of strong to severe thunderstorms developed and moved very slowly over south central and southeast Wisconsin through the evening hours. The individual storms were moving quite fast, about 40 to 50 mph, but the slow southward movement of the boundary these storms were developing along, resulted in storms repeatedly training, or moving, over the same area.||Widespread 3 to 4 inch amounts were reported along and either side of the I-94 corridor, with locally higher amounts of 5 to 8 inches.  The greatest rain amounts fell in Milwaukee County. Mitchell Field recorded 5.61 inches for the day, breaking a record for the date. The previous record was 1.26 set in 1948. This also is the second highest daily rainfall total on record for Milwaukee. The greatest one-day precipitation record was the 6.81 inches which fell on August 6, 1986. Madison also set a record for precipitation for the date at 3.62 inches. This beat the previous mark of 2.21 inches set in 1885. The 3.62 inches of rainfall ranks 13th for the most precipitation received in one day. The record is the 4.96 inches which fell on August 8, 1906. ||About 32,000 We Energy utility customers lost electrical power throughout southeast Wisconsin due to the flooding and lightning.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Thunderstorms training over the region produced flooding rains over all of Milwaukee County...causing massive flooding, shutting down streets and the freeway system at rush hour with up to 4 feet of rushing water.||There was one fatality - the body of a 19-year-old male was found in Lincoln Creek near N. 32nd St. and W.

In addition, another $1,946,100 dollars were spent in debris clearance and $894,988 dollars were spent for overtime. These costs are not directly related to the flood damage.||The Milwaukee Fire Department logged 50 rescues from homes and streets.  ||The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD) reported that the storm resulted in a combined sewer overflow of around 2 billion gallons. All Lake Michigan beaches in Milwaukee were closed through the following weekend of July 24th and 25th due to sewer contamination. The City of Milwaukee received at least 2000 calls for sewer backups into basements of homes. It appeared that the northern half of the city of Milwaukee was hardest hit. ||The flooding rains created a massive sink hole 20 feet deep and some 20 to 40 feet wide at the intersection of Oakland and North in the city of Milwaukee around 830 pm.  It swallowed a Sport Utility Vehicle and a street light. The driver of the SUV was injured and treated at a hospital.  Electrical power cables and other cable lines were damaged by the sink hole. ||Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport was closed late Thursday night (July 22nd) through 2 pm Friday (July 23rd) due to flooded runways. One runway was opened at 2 pm Friday, however there were additional delays. ||In Milwaukee County, over 4,400 homes reported water-filled basements in the city of Milwaukee alone.||11,764 homes received some sort of impact from the flooding, with 6 homes destroyed; 57 homes receiving major damage; 1,859 home receiving minor damage; and an additional 9,842 homes minimally affected by the flood waters.

The heaviest rains occurred between 900 AM and 300 PM Sunday in which up to 7 inches of rain was recorded. These heavy rains caused widespread street flooding and road closures in Aransas, San Patricio, Nueces, and Kleberg Counties.

This MCS produced excessive rainfall from Atascosa to Comal counties. CoCoRAHs observers reported 7.81 inches of rain near Pleasanton and 11.30 inches near New Braunfels.  Heavy rain began shortly after midnight over portions of southern Comal County.  Heavy rains in excess of 11+ inches fell in the area centered between the Guadalupe River and Highway 46 between 2 am and 8 am.  This runoff produced a massive flash flood along the Guadalupe primarily downstream of the 3rd river crossing.  Hardest hit areas were the campsites along River Road and areas directly along the riverbank in Gruene, New Braunfels, Lake Dunlap, Lake McQueeny, and Seguin.  Total losses are estimated into the 10s of millions of dollars.  One death occurred with several swift water rescues.  Dozens of campers, vehicles, and boats were lost in the resulting flood along the Guadalupe.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A storm survey along the Guadalupe River from River Road down into the city of New Braunfels showed devastation along the banks of the river.  The river rose some 20+ feet in less than 2 hours sweeping campers, cars, trailers, tubes, and other debris down the river toward New Braunfels and Seguin.  Campsites downstream of the 3rd River Road crossing where demolished and swept clean due to the power of water.  The campsites along the stretch of River Road near Camp Hueco Springs were especially hit hard as Elm creek flooded and brought tremendous water into the Guadalupe.  A death occurred at this location as a man was swept downstream.  Other campers were rescued down in New Braunfels after being swept miles downstream.  Tubing businesses along the Guadalupe suffered major losses along with homes from Gruene down into Seguin. Thirty vehicles and 14 RVs were removed from the River in Comal County.  One hundred twenty-one homes and businesses suffered damage.  Damage estimate does not include other insured losses.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Numerous homes and cars were flooded. One person died, and at least 136 people were injured. Damage was estimated at $5.5 million in Oklahoma county alone.||The event began late on June 13th, as thunderstorms developed over northwest Oklahoma. The thunderstorms developed ahead of a slow moving cold front that was located over southwest Kansas into the northern Texas panhandle. A large outflow boundary also extended eastward. The thunderstorms became more numerous as they moved along the outflow boundary.  Strengthened by the new rainfall, the outflow boundary dropped toward central Oklahoma, and a very moist low-level jet resulted in new thunderstorm development near the boundary.||The first round of significant rain impacted central Oklahoma around 3 am. This round moved east before another, longer lived, thunderstorm complex developed over the Oklahoma City metro area. The outflow boundary was located south of Interstate 40, and the low-level jet transported warm and unseasonably humid air north of the boundary, creating very heavy rain. Thunderstorms continued to develop over the southwest metro area, and slowly moved northeast. Rainfall rates averaged one to two inches per hour, with some thunderstorm bands producing rates near three inches per hour.||The heavy rain accumulated quickly immediately before and during the busy morning drive time. Numerous cars became stranded in the rapidly rising water. Roadways were covered by rapidly flowing water, and ponds, creeks, and rivers easily spilled over their banks. Navigating in and around the metro area became almost impossible, and many motorists had to be rescued by boat. After several hours, the persistent heavy rainfall tapered off around noon.||The larger area of heavy rainfall moved south as the outflow boundary moved into southern Oklahoma. Significant rain developed over southwest Oklahoma by early afternoon, and flash flooding once again became a problem. Lawton was hard hit, receiving between four and five inches of rain, resulting in several roadways becoming flooded. Numerous motorists had to be rescued from the high water. One motorist, unfortunately, lost his life when his vehicle stalled in flood waters.||Thunderstorms developed again over central Oklahoma late in the afternoon and evening, but luckily the duration of the thunderstorms was relatively short. By the time it was all said and done, widespread totals of five to nine inches were reported over much of Oklahoma City. Will Rogers World Airport reported its largest daily precipitation since records began in 1891, with 7.62 inches. Even higher totals were reported over the north-central portion of Oklahoma City, where nine to twelve inches was measured.||Strong winds caused some power outages during the event. At the peak of the event, over 6700 people were without power. Isolated pockets of wind damage did occur, with a power pole/power lines downed south of Drummond in Garfield county.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Another round of heavy rain occurred over parts of the Oklahoma City metro area. The heavy rain falling on already saturated ground quickly led to flash flooding. Several roadways had to be re-barricaded due to very high water. The water that had receded around some residences began to rise again. After the rain ended, some areas had received over a foot of rainfall for the day. Much of it fell in only a few hours. Total damages for the day were over $5 million. One hundred twenty-two homes were affected, 52 of those home receiving minor damage, 11 receiving major damage, and one home was completely destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

They said no one was seriously injured.  There was no damage to the apartments.  One or the individuals said he was just standing by the refrigerator, opened it up and the next thing he knew, he felt something go straight through his hand.  It felt like it went down my spine and hit me in the head like somebody punched me in the face and then I felt it go out my foot, but it happened in just like a second, he said.

The hail, ranging from golfball to baseball size, hit northeast Denver, Brighton and Commerce City the hardest.  The storms then continued to spread to the north and east; impacting Hudson, Prospect Valley, Byers and Deer Trail.   The strong thunderstorm wind and hail stripped bark and branches from trees.  Numerous accidents were reported as the hail accumulated up to a foot in depth on roadways.  Homes and vehicles in the area were pummeled by hail.   The Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Associated estimated to damage to be around $70 million; based off approximately 13,600 automobile and homeowner claims.  A child in Commerce City was struck in the leg by lightning while watching televison.  A bison and the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge was struck and killed by blast of lightning.  Two tornadoes also touched down in open country; one near Denver International Airport and the other near Keenesburg.  ||The heavy rain and hail caused flash flooding to occur around the towns of Hudson and Keenseburg; forcing the closure of State Highway 52.  Extensive crop damage was reported across southern Weld County.  Approximately 1500 acres of sugar beets were damaged in the Prospect Valley and Windsor areas.  About 360 acres of sweet corn, cabbage and onions in the Hudson area were inundated with heavy rain and a torrent of hail.  In Windsor, a barn was demolished by intense thunderstorm winds.   The wind ripped the 40-ft by 40-ft structure of a garage and exterior corrugated roof and walls about 75 yards from its original foundation. Also, two cow shelters and 150 calf shelters were blown over.  Near Bellvue, several structures were knocked down and a 15-ft silo was blown across a field by damaging thunderstorm winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A child was struck in the leg by lightning while watching television.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The airmass became unstable in front of it with a considerable push of deep moisture.  Precipitable water values increased to 2 to 2.4 inches by afternoon.  CAPE increased to 2500 to 4000 J/kg as afternoon temperatures climbed into the mid to upper 80s, with dewpoint readings in the low to middle 70s.  The lifted index fell to -5 to -7 C.  The atmosphere was not strongly sheared with 25 to 35 kts of effective shear available.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 600 and 800 J/kg.  Downdraft CAPE was in the 1000-1400 J/kg range.  A squall line developed ahead of the cold front and became marginally severe.  Many of the storms produced small hail and gusty winds.  A few locations reported winds in excess of 60 MPH, with the the highest winds reported of 64 MPH in Carroll County in Templeton.  High winds from thunderstorms moving into Winnebago County downed trees in a city park in Buffalo Center.  Winds estimated near 80 MPH snapped the top off of a power pole in Buffalo Center and also caused considerable tree damage and out building damage in the area.  Heavy rainfall was an issue with the storms given the high precipitable water values.  Three inches of rain fell in 50 minutes southeast of Madrid in Boone County, with reports of around 4 inches for storm total in the Ames area.  In Emmet County, 2.65 inches of rain fell in a little over an hour in Ringsted.  Fortunately, it has been quite dry for the previous 10 days.  The rains did not cause flash flooding, but did result in some urban flooding.  A 15 year old girl was struck by lightning in Leon as the thunderstorms passed.  She was walking across a parking lot and lightning struck just as she reached for the door handle of her car.  She was taken to hospital and remained overnight, however there were no detectable injuries beyond memory loss of the event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 15 year old girl was struck by lightning.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The proximity to the current can result in anything from tingling to actually knocking a person off their feet.  Several Charleston-based news agencies have talked to the teen who said the lightning traveled down the chimney and came in through the fireplace before striking him in the thigh.

The low eventually tracked from southwest Iowa in the afternoon to east central Iowa by early evening.  To the southeast of the front, temperatures warmed into the upper 70s to mid 80s, with dew point temperatures in the upper 50s to mid 60s.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with lifted indices falling to -5 to -8 Celsius and CAPE rising to 2000-3000 J/kg.  The situation was very dynamic with a synoptic scale upper level trough to the west and broad southwest flow over the central U.S.  The jet at 300 mb was around 100 kts with 500 mb winds southwest at 75+ kts.  This aided in producing deep layer shear of 75 to 100 kts over southeast Iowa by late afternoon.  Ample inflow was present with moisture transport at the 850 mb level produced by a 35 to 40 kt flow.  This increased precipitable water values to between 1 and 1.2 inches.  Thunderstorms fired along the frontal boundary during the mid to late afternoon as the front became a cold front.  With 300-400 J/kg of CAPE in the -10 to -30 layer of the atmosphere, and 700-1000 J/kg of downdraft CAPE available, the atmosphere was loaded for the production of wind and hail.  In addition, the freezing level was a relatively low 12,000 feet.  The line of thunderstorms that formed ahead of the advancing cold front became severe quickly, producing large hail.  Much of the hail was in the 1 to 1.5 inch diameter range, however there were several reports of golf ball to tennis ball size hail.  The largest hail was over northeast Iowa with golf ball size reported in Grundy County, and tennis ball size from the northwest edge of Waterloo toward Cedar Falls in Black Hawk County.  Also in Black Hawk County, a few stones were measured to 3.5 inches in diameter in Cedar Falls.  As the system unfolded, the storms began to produce high winds.  Wind gusts of 75 to 100 MPH occurred with the stronger storms.  Multiple homes had siding damage due to hail blown through the siding, and windows were knocked out in Marion County east of Monroe.  High winds snapped power poles in Jasper and Poweshiek Counties.  A camper was blown off of Interstate 80 at mile post 178, resulting in a multiple car accident.  In Poweshiek County, cars were blown off of the road and flipped, power poles snapped, and roofs were taken off of houses near Grinnell.  Power was knocked out to several thousand customers in the Grinnell area.  Six members of the Grinnell College track team were caught in the storm and sustained injuries from the hail.  They were bruised, taken to the hospital, treated and released.  Officials in the city of Grinnell estimated damage due to the high winds from this storm at $10,000,000.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms began in the late evening hours of Tuesday, July 13th, and lasted into the early morning hours of Wednesday, July 14th. ||Severe Thunderstorm Watch number 469 was initially issued late Tuesday evening for portions of southwest and most of south central North Dakota through the early morning hours of Wednesday, with rapid thunderstorm development across the southwest already underway. Tornado Watch number 470 was issued early Wednesday morning for far south central North Dakota as intense supercellular thunderstorms with very large hail continued to develop and move east across far southwest and south central parts of the state. The intense thunderstorms eventually transitioned from very large hail producers to damaging wind producers as they moved east of the Missouri River and towards and into the James River Valley region. ||Multiple severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings were issued. Numerous reports of large hail, including a record tying hailstone, and several reports of damaging thunderstorm winds were received during this episode. ||Damage from the very large hail was extensive and extreme. Hardest hit were Hettinger, Grant, Sioux, and Emmons Counties, where baseball to softball size hail fell. Some homes had hailstones crash completely through the roof. The large hail also killed several farm animals, and injured other livestock and pets. A North Dakota record tying hailstone, five inches in diameter, fell at Prairie Knights Resort located in eastern Sioux County. In addition, some areas in these counties experienced more than one wave of large hail. Later Wednesday morning, straight line winds up to 105 mph resulted in extensive damage over portions of Logan and LaMoure Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A North Dakota state record tying hailstone of five inches in diameter fell at Prairie Knights Casino and Resort.
