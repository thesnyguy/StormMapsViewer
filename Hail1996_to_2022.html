The storm reorganized with the storm-relative inflow favoring the north side of the storm.  As the storm moved into the Big Spring area the it became a left-split supercell with the velocity display from the KMAF WSR-88D showing a well-developed anti-cyclonically rotating mesocyclone.  The storm moved over the eastern half of the city from the south.  In southern Big Spring baseball size hail fell while over the northeastern and eastern parts of the city softball size hail was reported.  Graduation ceremony was ready to commence when softball hail struck Howard College.  Skylights on the coliseum roof were shattered sending glass falling onto the floor that would have been filled with candidates just a few minutes later.  The largest hail was reported at the intersection of I-20 and Business I-20 as the storm exited the city to the northeast.  A Boy Scout caravan of 5 vehicles was pummelled by 5 inch diameter hail.  The hail knocked out every window in every vehicle.Injuries from the storm included many cuts from broken glass and from direct strikes by jagged hailstones.  One hailstone broke the side window of a car and continued with enough force to break a woman's arm inside the car.   About 2000 residential roofs were replaced with many of these roofs less than a year old due to the April 3, 1995 hail storm.  The Big Spring storm then moved northeast to the Vincent community where softball hail was once again reported.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This storm had a continuous track of damaging winds and hail for 33 miles.  This track could have been longer, but in this desolate area, no other reports were available.  Although there was F1 scale damage, there were no confirmed tornado sightings.  Most of the significant damage was thought to have come from Rear-flank downdrafts, due to the location to the proximity of the large hail.  The storm was moving to the ESE at 45-50 mph, so forward-flank downdrafts could have caused some of the damage as well due to the summation of outflow speed and translational speed.  Along Highway 118 the fringe-to-fringe damage path was 8 miles wide--also suggesting large-scale outflow was a contributor to the damage.An unobstructed view from the northeast allowed people in the Midland/Odessa area to see the upper half of the storm from about 200 miles away just before sunset.  The storm tower showed strong signs of rotation (in the form of large bands) even from this distance.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> North of where the RFD winds caused damage, hail up to softball size smashed car windshields and pummelled a couple of houses.  One gentleman, who was attempting to close a window, was injured when hail broke the window and caused several facial lacerations.  He was taken  by private vehicle to the Alpine Hospital.  A second man suffered minor cuts on his legs.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Strong to severe thunderstorms developed rapidly in northern Maryland and tracked east-southeast into east-central and lower southern Maryland during the early evening.  The main culprits for damage were gusty winds and lightning, through a few occurrences of large hail were noted.Initial thunderstorms produced large hail in central Baltimore and northern Carroll Cos during the mid afternoon.  The real action began during the early evening commuting hours, when a severe thunderstorm knocked down numerous trees and large limbs on an east-southeast trek from Reisterstown to Essex.  The same cell produced wind-driven hail which broke windows of several automobiles in Reisterstown.  The flying glass shards injured one occupant of a vehicle; the shards had to be removed from his scalp.  Other wind damage was noted across southern Carroll Co and central Montgomery Co.The final round of storms fired during the mid-evening, producing damaging wind gusts (mainly trees and power lines), first in northern and eastern Anne Arundel Co.  Other storms developed over lower southern Maryland, producing tree and wire damage in St Mary's and Calvert Cos.Lightning was a major factor with the storms.  A lightning death occurred in southwest Baltimore City at 1730EST when two youngsters were running home to escape the storm.  They made it to the shelter of a large tree, which was struck.  The attendant current burned over half of the deceased's (a nine-year old girl) body.   Her 8 year-old friend survived with lesser burns.  Farther south, a small house fire was ignited by a lightning strike in Arnold.  Power outages of at least 33,000 Southern Maryland Electric Co. customers were directly attributed to a lightning strike at a supply station in St Mary's Co.  In all, at least 50,000 Maryland residents west of the Chesapeake Bay lost electricity during the outbreak of storms.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornadoes were spawned by a single storm between 6 and 715 pm CST in Pottawatomie and Seminole Counties. The first tornado (an F1) touched down 3.5 miles west-southwest of Maud in Pottawatomie County, moved east into Seminole County, lifting about 11 miles west-southwest of Wewoka. The second tornado (rated F2) touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Wewoka in Seminole County, moved east through Wewoka, and crossed into Hughes County.  Meanwhile, the third tornado (also an F2) developed about 4.5 miles west-southwest of Yeager in Hughes County. These two tornadoes then merged about 3.5 miles southwest of Yeager and continued east until they lifted 4 miles east of Yeager.   This tornadic thunderstorm also produced hail as large as softballs southwest of Seminole in Seminole County. Baseball sized hail was reported with a different storm in Oklahoma City in Oklahoma County.  Widespread hail and wind damage occurred in Ponca City in Kay County and in Norman in Cleveland County.Wind gusts were estimated as high as 70 mph near Wellston and Warwick in Lincoln County. Significant thunderstorm wind damage occurred throughout Lincoln County, in Purcell in McClain County, and near Calumet and El Reno in Canadian County.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A man and an elderly woman were injured when they were caught outside in the hailstorm.

The most severe weather occurred along a corridor roughly along and 40 miles to the south of US 380 from west of Throckmorton in Throckmorton County eastward to Greenville in Hunt County.  Occasionally propagating in a train echo fashion, these storms were efficient hail and wind producers.  Wise County was hardest hit by severe weather on the 8th, with wind, hail, and one confirmed tornado destroying 15 houses and damaging 178 others.  Widespread damage to automobiles and trees also were reported.  In Denton County, thunderstorm winds blew down powerlines across Interstate 35-E near Lake Dallas, closing both northbound and southbound lanes of traffic.  In the ensuing traffic jam, motorists were stranded in their vehicles as another severe thunderstorm moved across the area.

In spite of the instability, the atmosphere was capped by very warm air aloft.  Temperatures at the 700 mb level were between 12 degrees C and 14 degrees C.  As a result, thunderstorms had a difficult time forming.  The atmosphere was primed with CAPE values in the 4000 to 6000 J/kg range by late morning.  Helicity values were near 300 M2/S2.  One cell was able to break the cap and became severe.  It was a prolific hail producer as well as spawning several tornadoes.  Hail reports indicated frequent baseball size hail with a few reports to softball size and larger.  The largest report was an incredible 5 inch diameter stone north of Gilbert in Story County.  The damage caused was incredible.  In some town, every north facing window was broken out by the hail.  On one building, the hail was so large that it broke the stone tile roof in the building, smashing it into pieces.  Property damage was extensive in a swath from Sac County through Marshall County.  Total property damage was estimated to be well in excess of $5,000,000.  In Calhoun County, the town of Lohrville was hard hit by baseball size hail.  Damage in the town was estimated at $1 million as the hail knocked out windows in almost all of the 225 buildings in town.  One injury was reported in Lohrville as a woman was treated for an eye injury as shards of glass flew into her eye from a car windshield broken by the hail.  Crop damage was difficult to assess, but was extensive.  Thousands of acres of crops were shredded by the hail.  In Webster County, estimates of crop damage indicated 24,000+ acres had total crop loss and 20,000+ acres suffered 30-50% loss.  Crop loss in the county was expected to be over $14 million.  In addition to the crop loss, property loss was estimated at between $2 and $4 million.  Many emergency managers described the hail event as the worst in 25 years in some areas to the worst they have ever seen in others.  To give some idea of the severity, the hail was large enough to shatter tile roofs.  Scenes of broken tiles falling off of houses were common.  The hail also took a toll on wildlife.  Numerous Pheasants, rabbits, and other small animals were killed by the hail, not to mention the smashed birds eggs.  The thunderstorm cell itself was a classic cell on WSR-88D radar.  It contained a clear hook echo and bounded weak echo region.  In spite of the structure looking text book perfect, the cell had a hard time producing a tornado.  Several brief touchdowns were reported from northwest of Boone to the vicinity of Boone.  The cell became better organized as it moved into central Iowa.  A tornado touched down in Story County and moved into Marshall County.  This tornado was fairly small and had a very intermittent track.  Storm chasers indicated that the tornado lifted several times during its life.  Damage was limited as the tornado tracked totally across open country and caused only crop damage for the most part.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A particularly severe thunderstorm affected Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita County, causing extensive damage to many of the buildings and an aircraft. Two soldiers were also injured by large hail.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Hail larger than golf balls, combined with severe thunderstorm winds up to 79 mph, caused extensive damage and 2 injuries at Sheppard Air Force Base.  The 2 injuries occurred when some soldiers were caught outside in the hailstorm.  48 (out of a squadron of 200) T-37 training jets were damaged by 2-inch hail.  The winds blew the protective covers from the planes and the hail then knocked holes in the wings and broke the planes' windshields.  Over 100 cars on the base were damaged. A window was knocked out of the air traffic control tower.  One house sustained heavy damage when all of its west-facing shutters were destroyed and  3 skylights and 2 windows were broken.

The thunderstorms evolved into a squall line as they moved across southeast Michigan.  Instability was high on this warm and humid summer day, allowing many of the storms to become severe.Unlike the previous day, severe reports were almost evenly split between large hail and damaging wind.  Most of the damaging wind gusts took down trees, tree limbs, utility poles, and power lines.  However, the marine community felt the brunt of the severe thunderstorm winds in two separate incidents.  A large number of sailboats were returning to the Bay City Yacht Club after a competition on Saginaw Bay, when the line of storms struck.  As many as a dozen boats were capsized, with two sailboats demasted.  On Lake St Clair, wind gusts capsized one sailboat, and caused a cabin cruiser to run aground.The largest hail of the day, golfball sized, was reported in Kawkawlin, Bay City, Zilwaukee, and Southfield.  In Bay City, the large hail fell on the exposed mariners (see above), causing welts and bruises to at least two.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The largest severe thunderstorm developed in Sequoyah County Oklahoma and then strengthened as it moved across Crawford and Franklin Counties along Interstate 40.  Along the way, this storm produced giant hail as large as baseballs and softballs.  This storm demonstrated strong rotation, producing a brief tornado touchdown just west of Alma and considerable damage from softball-sized hail in Alma.  A second weaker, though severe, thunderstorm formed over southern Crawford County and followed the same path as the first storm.  Finally, a severe thunderstorm moved out of northeast Oklahoma and clipped northwest Benton County, producing marginally severe hail.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> There were several reports of extremely large hail from Alma. The largest report was of giant softball-sized hail, while there were also reports of quarter and golfball-sized hail just north of Alma.Such enormous hail caused widespread damage in Alma.  Many cars sustained windshield and body damage.  Just one auto body shop reported that it had written estimates from hail damage totaling $140,000.  Many roofs also sustained major damage.  At the Eagle Crest Golf Course, the hail left small craters on the greens, closing the course for several days while the crater marks were filled.  A photo in the Alma Journal newspaper showed a softball-sized pock mark on the golf greens.A child was treated for injuries at a local hospital after being struck by the hail.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 800K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Additional roof and tree damage occurred in Monticello neighborhood of River Oaks. A number of businesses were then damaged or destroyed near the intersection of Camp Bowie and West Seventh (620 PM). Tornado moved east along West Seventh Street, striking the Montgomery Ward building and the adjacent Linwood neighborhood, doing extensive damage to older homes (622 PM). The tornado then did extensive damage to the six story Cash America building, nearly destroying it. Further significant damage was then done to the Mallick Tower building and Calvary Cathedral Building (624 PM). The tornado weakened as it entered downtown, but wind borne debris broke thousands of windows in buildings and high rises (626 PM). Particularly hard hit was the Bank One Building, which had 80% (3,000) of its windows broken, and the Union Pacific Resources Building (1,300 of 5,000 windows broken). Numerous other structures were affected to a lesser degree. Automobiles in streets and parking lots were also damaged. The tornado then dissipated as it moved east of downtown, although scattered minor damage occurred to roofs, trees, fences, and billboards about 3 miles east of the city near I-30 and Brentwood Stair. 	Two people were killed as a direct result of the tornado. A man (age 52) was killed while trying to reach shelter after warning others of the tornado, while a homeless man (age 67) was killed by a wall that collapsed on him. Some 80 other people were injured, but only six required hospitalization. Hail did extensive damage to roofs and autos mainly in Lake Worth and Saginaw. 	Initial tornado damage in Arlington occurred at a restaurant on South Cooper street. The tornado moved east and gained strength, doing F3 damage near Bardin and Matlock (707 PM), south of I-20. The tornado then struck the northern part of Arlington Airport (F2). The tornado paralled I-20, crossing the Interstate about one mile west of Highway 360, overturning at least one 18-wheeler (F1)(712 PM). The tornado then began moving northeast, ending with F2 damage to subdivision just northeast of Grand Prairie airport (near Arkansas and Parkside)(720 PM). In spite of the damage, there were no deaths or serious injuries in Arlington or Grand Prairie.	One commercial building was destroyed in Arlington, and 22 others damaged.

The storm produced a prolific path of large hail, a brief tornado, and a significant wet microburst across central and east central Wisconsin.  The storm was one of the most damaging thunderstorms in Wisconsin history, producing well over $100 million in damage.The thunderstorm developed north of a warm front, which was located across the Wisconsin/Illinois border.  The setup was favorable for what is known as "elevated" convection; that is, the source of the instability was aloft, and not surface-based.  Elevated convection often produces large hail, and the May 12 storm was no exception.As the storm moved into central Wisconsin, numerous reports of large hail were received from Waushara and Winnebago counties.  Baseball size hail was observed with the storm in Waushara county, two miles east of Coloma and in Dakota.  Hail damaged many of the roofs of the more than 1,000 homes in Omro (Winnebago co.) alone.As the storm intensified, it produced extensive damage across Calumet and Manitowoc counties as microburst winds developed.  Wind-driven hail shredded west-facing sides of homes and businesses that were caught in the path of the storm.The worst damage in Calumet county was in and around Chilton, where 2 inch hail and hurricane-force wind gusts (estimated near 80 mph) knocked holes in siding and tore the walls and roofs from some buildings.  Over 1000 homes were damaged in the city of Chilton.  Two hundred more sustained damage in the township of Charlestown.A brief tornado occurred as the storm entered Manitowoc county, but did no damage.  At about 1150 a.m. CDT, microburst winds near 100 mph and 2 inch hail combined to produce very serious damage in St. Nazianz.  Most of the homes in a mobile home park in St. Nazianz were overturned or knocked off their foundation by the straight-line wind.  Thirty people were injured in Manitowoc county, most in St. Nazianz.    In Manitowoc county, over 100 homes were destroyed by the combination of wind and hail.  Many more were damaged.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 46M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The damage began on the southwest side of the city with reports (including ham radio, media, and spotters) of large hail and wind gusts estimated over 80 mph.  The largest hail size was estimated at 4 1/2 inches, which caused extensive damage over $6 million to more than 2000 homes, mainly roof and siding damage.The hail and wind blew out many windows,  injuring one person with flying glass. The storm knocked out power to over 20,000 residences. Damage to vehicles was even more costly. Several automobile dealerships sustained major damage to nearly every car in their lots...totaling around 1000 vehicles. One man was injured in his vehicle when a hailstone crashed through his windshield, causing facial lacerations. In addition, the storm produced flash flooding, with many streets rendered temporarily impassable.  A National Weather Service damage assessment reported dozens of trees damaged and snapped...was concluded to be due to straight-line winds and hail, not a tornado.  An automated weather observation station at the Florence airport,  just east of the city, recorded a peak wind of 59 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was the third round of severe thunderstorms to strike southern Wisconsin due to the same basic weather pattern.  Hailstones the size of baseballs (up to 3 inches in diameter) pounded the northern 3 mile stretch of these two counties, resulting in substantial damage to hundreds of homes (roofs and siding) and hundreds of vehicles.  Two people in Marquette County and 4 people in Green Lake County were injured by the large hailstones and needed medical treatment. The hailstones left impact marks on sidewalks in the Crystal Lake area of north-central Marched County. In Green Lake County crop damage was also noted.  Downburst winds of 60 to 70 mph also accompanied the hail, resulting in many trees being pushed over. Interestingly, this severe hailstorm occurred north of a warm front, with air temperatures only in the 60s. The warm front moved north to a Wisconsin Dells to Sheboygan line while a frontal "triple-point" formed near the Dells due to a cool front pushing in from the west.

This was the third round of severe thunderstorms to strike southern Wisconsin due to the same basic weather pattern.  Hailstones the size of baseballs (up to 3 inches in diameter) pounded the northern 3 mile stretch of these two counties, resulting in substantial damage to hundreds of homes (roofs and siding) and hundreds of vehicles.  Two people in Marquette County and 4 people in Green Lake County were injured by the large hailstones and needed medical treatment. The hailstones left impact marks on sidewalks in the Crystal Lake area of north-central Marched County. In Green Lake County crop damage was also noted.  Downburst winds of 60 to 70 mph also accompanied the hail, resulting in many trees being pushed over. Interestingly, this severe hailstorm occurred north of a warm front, with air temperatures only in the 60s. The warm front moved north to a Wisconsin Dells to Sheboygan line while a frontal "triple-point" formed near the Dells due to a cool front pushing in from the west. The thunderstorm which first produced hail in Sauk County while moving northeast, gradually turned more to the right (east), as it entered Marquette, Green Lake, and Waushara Counties, and transformed into a high-precipitation supercell. Eventually this supercell did spawn a tornado in Manitowoc County, and 100 mph straight-line winds in Calumet and Manitowoc Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The hail covered the ground to several inches in some locations with most stones in the 1/2 to 1 1/2 inch range, although some were larger.   From central into downtown Omaha, as the hail fell the visibility was lowered to near zero and the hail drifted like snow and shovels were used to clear some sidewalks.  An elderly Omaha woman was injured with some cuts and bruises from the hail when she was caught outside.  According to State Farm Insurance agents, the storm was the costliest hailstorm in the Omaha area at least since the late 1980's and possibly ever.  State Farm estimated that there would be 100,000 claims in the Omaha Metro area.  Most of the larger hail spared the northwest sections of the Metro area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Strong winds also flipped a tractor trailer along Interstate 70 near Watkins.  At least 30 private planes at Front Range Airport were totalled.  The radome protecting the National Weather Service doppler radar, which was tracking the storm, also sustained damage.  The storm caused power outages which affected about 1,200 residents.  Excluding the damage done at Denver International Airport, damage estimates totalled $49 million, making it the costliest storm in the last 3 years, and 10th costliest since 1984.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 49M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This storm exhibited very subtle bowing, but otherwise there was little to note about it's structure. Damage from this storm was limited to a residential mobile and modular home area perched on a broad hill. The homes were situated on 1 acre lots, so they were not densely packed.The damage primarily consisted of rolled and broken mobile homes. The damage area was limited to an area less than one mile in diameter. Five mobile homes were rolled and destroyed. Four mobile and modular homes sustained major roof damage. The mobile homes that were destroyed were scattered between homes which were completely undamaged. Examination of destroyed homes indicated that they were not tied down or had inadequate or no skirting at all. Homes that had plywood skirting and were tied down weathered the storm. Debris patterns provided evidence of diffluent winds, suggesting straight-line downburst winds. Five people recieved minor injuries from side being inside rolled mobile homes. Two injuries were the result of wind driven hail after escaping a destroyed mobile home.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Their intensity was aided by a large cold pocket of air aloft combined with the strong June midday sunshine. As the storms approached the Hudson Valley of eastern New York, some of them became severe. Most of the reports were of hail damage. However, there two confirmed tornado touchdowns as well as one non-tornadic destructive wind report. The first of two tornados in eastern New York touched intermittenly down in the town of Florida, Montgomery County between Klapmeyer and Hartley Roads, to the southwest of Amsterdam. The path of this tornado varied between 50 and 100 yards and was approximately 3 miles long. Numerous trees were downed and there was minor damage to several houses as  well as one barns. The tornado vortex then lifted back off the ground but was still visible as a funnel cloud. The vortex touched down again briefly in the town of Amsterdam, near Mcquade Road. This second path was only a quarter mile long and about 50 yards wide. Approximately 10 trees were knocked down and minor damage was reported to two homes. The top wind gusts were estimated to be around 70 mph with this tornado. A  second twister, ranked as an F1 with top winds estimated around 100 mph, touched down near Pawling in Dutchess County, very close to the place a tornado had struck just two weeks before. The path of this tornado was 125 yards wide and a mile long. Damage was mostly confined to many downed and twisted trees. One tree did fall onto a garage thereby damaging it.  Thunderstorm winds blew two trees down on Ravena Road in the town of Coeyamns, Albany County. Golf ball size hail (1.75 inches in diameter)  was reported in Chatham while ping pong size hail (1.5 inches in diameter) was reported in the town of Stockport, Columbia County. One inch hail fell at Hopewell Junction, Dutchess County. There were additional reports of dime size hail in Schenectady, Rennselaer and Greene Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the severe storm rolled across Buffalo county, it moved southeast along Highway 40 through Amherst, near Riverdale and eventually into the city of Kearney.  In excess of 6000 structures will require roof, window, and siding repairs.  In some cases, hail stones penetrated the shingles, sheeting, and interior ceiling drywall.  One person reported an 8 inch diameter hole in their roof.  Another home owner sustained $60,000 in damage.  One more home owner reported hail stones landing on the living room couch, after falling through the roof.  Over 3000 automobiles were severely damaged. One local auto dealership experienced damage to 297 cars on the lot.  Hundreds of windows were lost on the campus of the University of Nebraska-Kearney.  Eight police cruisers were damaged.  Fifteen (15) people were treated for minor abrasions and released from the local hospital.  Several hailstones measured 5 inches in diameter throughout the county, and there were unconfirmed reports of melon sized hail near Amherst.In Kearney county, extensive damage was noted in the Minden area.  Four and a half (4.5) inch diameter hail was reported in the city.  The most extensive damage occurred at the indoor greenhouse facility which grows tomatoes.  The glass structure was no match for the softball size hailstones.  2500 pains of glass were broken, including about 60 percent of the roof panes.  Shards of glass penetrated the tomatoes and forced the expulsion of the product for safety reasons.  Crop damage was widespread throughout the county as over 22,000 acres of corn, soybeans and alfalfa were severely damaged or destroyed.  The storm continued south and produced more crop and property damage in parts of Webster and Franklin counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> All injuries were minor<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A weak frontal system advanced across the plains into the state.  Temperatures warmed in to the 70s with dew points approaching 60 near an approaching warm frontal boundary from the south.  Lifted indices were in the -3 to -4 C. range.  A line of thunderstorms developed over Nebraska and advanced into western Iowa by evening.  One storm developed ahead of the line in Carroll County.  This storm became severe and dropped nickle to golf ball size hail in Carroll County.  Although radar gave strong suggestions of a tornado development, only a rotating wall cloud was observed.  As the main line of storms moved in from the west, there were numerous reports of 40 to 50 MPH winds along the line.

The storm moved east across Ballard County, producing quarter-size hail. One-inch diameter hail was reported on U.S. Highway 60 at mile marker 7, near Barlow. Hailstones grew larger as the storm crossed McCracken County, pounding the southwest side of Paducah and Lone Oak with hail from golf ball to tennis ball size. Thousands of vehicles were dented, and hail broke some windshields, including the windshield of a deputy sheriff's vehicle. The roofs of hundreds of buildings sustained at least minor damage. The only known injury occurred in Paducah, when a woman leaving church received cuts and abrasions from hailstones. She was treated at a local hospital. As the storm continued east across northern Marshall County, hail up to baseball size broke the windshields of many vehicles and damaged the siding and roofing of homes. A downburst with estimated 80 MPH winds began along Highway 641 and continued east for 3 miles toward Kentucky Lake. Numerous trees were blown down, some of which landed on houses. In Lyon County, the storm produced golf-ball hail east of Barkley Dam before finally weakening. Although total damage estimates as reported by insurance companies are in the tens of millions of dollars, the exact amount will never be known.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Another storm in Ottawa in LaSalle county produced hail the size of golfballs, injuring a person at Chambers and Glover Streets.  60 mph winds in and near Ottawa damaged corn crops and blew tree limbs down on the road.  A bolt of lightning struck a tree in Ottawa causing the tree to fall onto a fence and pool which were damaged.  A storm dropped hail in southern Grundy and southwest Will counties.  Hail damaged crops from north and east of Kinsman to just west of Verona, just east of Mazon, north and east of Gardner, and north of Morris in Grundy county.  Trees, large limbs and power lines were blown down in Gardner.  Hail also fell from near Wilmington in Will county into Kankakee county near Essex.  Another storm in northern Will county dropped hail up to 1.25 inches in diameter from the far west side of Joliet and Plainfiled near Drauden and Caton Farm, across I-55 and Route 30, to I-55 and Weber Road in Romeoville and Bolingbrook.  This storm also caused tree damage in Lemont in Cook county.  Later in the afternoon a storm dropped hail 1 to 2 inches in diameter across DuPage county. Some locations included Army Trail and Gary in Bloomingdale, 2 miles north of Route 64 and 59 in West Chicago, Route 83 and Grand in Addison, Glendale Heights, Wheaton and Lombard.  The biggest hail report was 2 inches at Carol Stream.  Other storms produced hail near Ashkum in Iroquois county and into northwest Indiana.

Although individual storms were moving toward the northeast, the line appeared to be moving to the southeast.  The downburst winds were all discharged toward the southwest, as all damage around Crystal City area was blown in that direction.  Damage was severe in Crystal City.  Leaves had been shredded from trees and plastered onto the sides of the cars and houses, and streets were covered with the shredded leaves.  Homes had damage to their outside walls, roofs, and windows.  What was shocking was to see the piles of semi-melted hail still as high as 2 feet in some of the drifts created by the flooding.  In spite of the fact that the hail had been melting for over 24 hours when the survey was made, it was still piled in spotty waves across the city from east to west and north to south.  Hail was reported to have been as large as 1.5 to 2 inches in diameter, with a couple of reports of hail to 3 inches.  The high winds, combined with hail and rain, caused widespread damage to homes, destroying two mobile homes and the roofs of two houses.  Several dozen homes in Crystal City sustained some type of damage.  Some of the worst damage occurred at the library and the H.E.B. grocery store.  The metal roof was blown off the library and deposited on the southwest side of the building.  The roof of the H.E.B. grocery store collapsed.  It appeared to be beneath the area where the air conditioners were positioned on the west side of the store.  This is also where the rain and ice would have accumulated the thickest and would possibly have clogged drainage holes.  One injury was reported in the storms.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

They noted widespread damage to trees and vegetation beginning near that point and continuing northward to the San Marcos Tanger Outlet Mall and Prime Time Outlet Mall.  The damage was caused by a combination of large hail and winds gusting 40 to 50 mph.  NWS NEXRAD Radar late Thursday afternoon had indicated severe thunderstorms in that area moving toward the northeast.At the south end of the Malls, the parking lot surface was covered with dents and impressions produced by the wind and hail. Hundreds of vehicles had been damaged in this event but only a few remained in the area.  Most of these had all of the window glass broken out with hundreds of hail dents in the car bodies.  At this part of the Malls, damage to store signs was seen only on the north and west sides of buildings.  There was no damage to signs on the south and east sides.  Therefore, the storm winds had propelled the hail toward the southeast.  In addition to the sign damage, hundreds of roof tiles had been broken and cracked, and many of these had fallen into the parking lot during the storm.As the team drove northward through the Mall areas, the same type of damage to building signs and roofs as well as parking surfaces was seen.  However, at the north end of the Malls, damage to the store signs was confined to the south and west walls of the buildings.  In this part of the Malls, the damaging winds had propelled the hail toward the northeast.  Thus, the pattern of damage was fan-shaped, with the winds generally blowing the hail toward the west, but with a southeast component of motion on the south end of the Malls and a northeast component of motion on the north end of the Malls.  This type of damage is clearly indicative of straight-line winds, also referred to as "downburst winds."  One of the NWS staff members was at the Malls during the storm.  Dents in his vehicle were 4.25 inches in diameter, indicating that at some of the hail stones were as large as grapefruits.  He had estimated windspeeds to be between 60 and 70 mph.The team drove roads in all directions from the Mall areas and concluded that the severe wind and hail had caused the worst damage in an area enclosed by Wonder World Drive, Posey Road, Hunter Road, and FM266 which is also known as Old Bastrop Highway.  Other areas of large hail and damaging winds were reported to the NWS, but the level of damage was generally more isolated and less severe.Damages from this storm were estimated at $100M with up to 10,000 vehicles damaged and another 7000 vehicles in homes in the area.  Losses to businesses as a result of closing the following day were estimated at $500,000.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A cold front extended from northwest Minnesota into central Kansas.  The cold front moved into the northwest corner of Iowa by the mid afternoon hours.  Surface CAPE values were quite high at 3500 to 5500 J/kg, however there was very little 0-3 km shear.  Shear values were under 10 kts.  Afternoon high temperatures reached the mid 80s to mid 90s.  These temperatures, combined with dew point readings around 70, produced lifted indices in the -8 to -11 C. range.  Convection was limited by convection that had occurred during the morning to the south of Iowa.  The outflow boundary moved into the area, tending to stabilize the airmass somewhat for the afternoon hours.  Thunderstorms that did develop tended to produce hail.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the sounding were in the 400 to 700 J/kg range.  These values were quite high, but were countered by the high freezing levels.  Mid afternoon freezing levels were between 13,500 and 14500 feet.  The lower part of the sounding was quite dry, and as a result the LCL value was between 7000 to 8000 feet, significantly reducing the tornado threat.  Thunderstorms developed during the mid afternoon hours over north central Iowa.  One of them produced nickle size hail as it moved east of Northwood in Worth County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A moist and unstable airmass ahead of the cold front provided the fuel to generate severe thunderstorms that included five tornadoes, near record-size hail and damaging winds.  Thousands of homes sustained damage and about 15,000 customers lost power during the storms, some for almost 3 days as trees blocked roads and slowed repair work to power lines.  Four people sustained minor injuries, and total damage from the storms exceeded $60 million.||The first tornado of the outbreak moved across eastern Marathon County shortly after 4:00 PM CDT, producing damage to several homes.  The tornado was rated EF2.||A second thunderstorm produced a weak tornado in Wood County, which was rated EF0.  The same storm responsible for this tornado produced softball size hail that damaged thousands of homes, several businesses and hundreds of vehicles.  One hailstone that fell in Port Edwards measured 5.50 inches in diameter, making it the second largest hailstone on record in Wisconsin.||The same supercell thunderstorm that produced the Marathon County tornado also produced a long-track tornado across northeast Shawano, northwest Menominee, southeast Langlade and northern Oconto counties.  This tornado was on the ground for 47 minutes, covering 40.1 miles, and destroyed 14,400 acres of woodlands (timber loss was estimated at $12.5 million) and dozens of buildings along its path.  The twister, which was over one-half mile at times, was rated EF3, with peak winds estimated of 150 to 160 mph.  The storm responsible for the tornado also produced significant straight-line wind damage as it moved into western Marinette County.  ||The fourth tornado of the outbreak, rated EF1, developed near Cedarville in Marinette Co., which was from the same thunderstorm that produced the long-track tornado. ||The final tornado of the afternoon and evening touched down near Harmony in Marinette Co.  This tornado was rated EF1.||Details of the tornadoes, hail, and wind damage can be found in the event narratives of the affected counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Hail broke the windshield of a FedEx delivery truck.

Despite the occurrence of thirteen tornadoes across the South Plains region, most of the damage resulted from destructive hail and heavy rainfall.  ||Thunderstorms first developed over the northern South Plains around 13:00 CST. These early afternoon storms initiated as supercells, but transitioned into a small-scale convective complex that produced extensive amounts of large hail and heavy rainfall. As the storms trained over the Interstate 27 corridor in Swisher County, a significant hail accumulation and flood event resulted in some 50 vehicles becoming stalled and a prolonged closure of the highway through the overnight hours.||Additional storms developed during the mid to late afternoon hours over the central South Plains. Two supercell thunderstorms impacted Lubbock County. One of these storms produced a destructive hail swath through the city of Lubbock damaging some 3,000 homes and more than 1,100 vehicles totaling an estimated $40 million in damages. Meanwhile a second supercell storm over eastern Lubbock County produced a family of weak tornadoes along U.S. Highway 82 east of Idalou. ||Other supercell storms impacted portions of Garza and Kent Counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. These storms additionally produced damaging hail and brief tornadoes.||By late evening, storm modes transitioned toward broken convective complexes and multicell structures. An unstable low-level environment, however, continued to be characterized by an increasingly enhanced veering of the wind fields. Thus, despite a transition toward less discrete storm cells, the threat for tornadoes remained. Multiple small scale low-level circulations developed within the evolving convective complexes, and these circulations proved to be tornadic. An EF-1 tornado damaged five structures and downed power poles as it tracked nearly eight miles across northwestern Lubbock County and southwestern Hale County around 20:00 CST. Two additional EF-1 tornadoes impacted the Abernathy (Hale County) and Roosevelt (Lubbock County) areas through the 21:00 CST hour. Meanwhile, similar tornadic circulations developed within other storm complexes over portions of Dickens, Kent, and King Counties. Multiple reports of tornadoes were received from rural areas around the Spur, Girard, and Guthrie vicinities but no damages resulted.||In all, an estimated $41.3 million in damages and three injuries resulted from severe weather across the South Plains region of west Texas on the 16th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Giant two and a half inch hail stones fell over the South Haven, Sun Ridge, and Lake Ridge subdivisions of southwest Lubbock between Slide Road and Quaker Avenue around 15:40 CST. The hailstones damaged roofs and skylights on over a 1,000 homes in the mentioned subdivisions, and three persons sought medical treatment at local hospitals for minor injuries related to the hail. Hail stones also reportedly killed a number of birds. Well over 600 vehicles were damaged in these subdivisions and adjacent areas of the city. Damages in the mentioned subdivisions were estimated at $20 million, with hail damage across the city of Lubbock estimated to total $40 million.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The setup for the event featured a slow moving warm front that was draped from far northwest Missouri southeastward into central Missouri. This front had been reinforced by a complex of thunderstorms that had impacted northern Missouri during the overnight and early morning hours prior, allowing abundant low level moisture to become pooled along the front. Strong daytime heating along and south of the front sent temperatures into the middle and upper 80s. With strong instability and moisture in place by late afternoon, conditions were ripe for rapid thunderstorm development as an upper level disturbance moving through Kansas provided the lift necessary for thunderstorms. However, it was the strong turning and increase in winds with height (known as wind shear) that set the stage for severe storms, specifically supercells.||While these extremely photogenic storms thankfully were not damaging tornado producers, June 7th featured some of the most destructive hail ever observed across northern Missouri, with two separate storms producing softball and grapefruit size hail, leaving widespread destruction to trees, homes, and vehicles.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Grapefruit sized hail lasted 10 minutes, on the west shore of Lake Viking.

Surface temperatures on the 8th warmed into the upper 80s and 90s, with dew point readings in the 70s.  A weak cold front moved into the state during the evening of the 8th and early morning of the 9th.  There was little thunderstorm development initially as the airmass was capped.  Temperatures at the 700 mb level were +14 to +17 C.   During the early morning hours of the 9th, a short wave lifted northeast out of the southern Rockies.  This resulted in cooling of the mid levels of the atmosphere, thus destabilizing the airmass.  The cold front stall out during the morning of the 9th as a second short wave lifted northast.   Eventually, the front moved south of the state on the night of the 9th.  Overall lifted indices were in the -6 to -10 C range with CAPE values in the 3000 to 4000 J/kg range.  Downdraft CAPE was in the 800 to 1400 J/kg range with 30 to 50 kts of shear available.  CAOE available in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 300 and 700 J/kg, with a freezing level of 14,000 to 14,500 feet.  The LCL was relatively high across the area ranging from just below 1000 meters to about 1250 meters.  Plenty of moisture was available with precipitable water values between 1.75 and 2.25 inches.  Thunderstorms developed initially over Nebraska and tracked east-northeast into Iowa shortly after sunrise.  One supercell continued to track across the state and produced a swath of wind and hail damage from Sac County east to Black Hawk County.  Additional thunderstorms formed along the cold frontal boundary by mid morning and progressed into the state.  The storms remained below severe levels for several hours, but did become severe by mid afternoon.  A broken like of storms formed with two primary areas tracking east across central and southern Iowa.  These two areas featured mini bow echoes.  The predominant mode of severe weather in the afternoon was high winds.  Several of the storms produced hail, but the hail was sub-severe.  A long lived supercell Thunderstorm tracked across northern Iowa Sunday morning with the Highway 20 corridor receiving the brunt of the damage.  Reports of quarter to golf ball sized hail were common with some hail stones reported to be in excess of two inches approaching the size of a tennis ball.  The hail was wind blown as well, at speeds of 50 to 70 mph, making it extremely damaging and dangerous striping siding off houses and knocking out windows.   A measured wind speed of 68 mph was recorded at a KCCI TV SchoolNet site near Jewell in Hamilton County.   Significant hail damage was received all along the track with areas near Otho, Callender, Radcliffe, Eldora and Grundy Center hit particularly hard.  In Eldora, many homes had windows broken out and tree and power line damage left the city without power. Winds of over 100 MPH toppled a communication tower in Eldora.  A short time before the winds hit Eldora, a 102 MPH wind gust was recorded at the landfill northwest of town.  Wind driven hail of 2 to 3 inches in diameter broke all siding and windows out on the north and west walls of most homes, with hail stones reported landing inside of houses.  Damage in the town of Eldora was expected to be greater than the damage done in the town of Parkersburg by the EF5 tornado a year earlier.  A 150 square mile area of crops was affected in Hardin County.  Total losses were reported on 45,000 acres, with 60% or greater loss on another 55,000 acres.  Hail damage in the Otho to Callender areas was described as the worst seen in 20 years.  MODIS satellite pictures of the crop damage area included in this report.  Estimates of crop damage from this one supercell were over $175,000,000.  Governor Culver declared Hardin County a state disaster area within a day or two of the storm, and declared Webster County a disaster area about a week later.  Formal paperwork was turned in to make 8 Iowa counties federal disaster areas,  They were Calhoun, Grundy, Hamilton, Hardin, Ida, Sac, Webster, and Woodbury.  Following the storms, a shelter was set up for those who felt they should not stay in their homes. Luckily the evening round of storms tracked south. Campers at nearby Pine Lake State Park, gathered for an archery event, were bruised by hail.  There were 22 reports of injuries in Hardin County, 11 serious enough for people to be taken to hospital, but there are no known life threatening injuries.  A second round of severe weather rolled roughly along I-80 between 1630 and 1800 CST, producing a lot of tree and power line damage but apparently little structural damage.  As the storms moved through the metropolitan Des Moines area, winds damaged power lines and knocked out power to 12,000 homes.  One storm produced a wet microburst in Union County.  The winds took the roof and shingles off of a two story brick building near Afton.  The afternoon round of storms produced some hail, but most of the hail was not severe as mentioned above, and was pea size or smaller.  During the morning round of storms, lightning struck a building in Waverly.  The lightning struck an antenna on the building and melted screws all the way down the side of the building, starting a small fire and blowing hole in the wall.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Large hail brok windows out of a residence and caused considerable crop damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Stain glassed windows were destroyed at Friends University and hundreds of homes and businesses received roof and window damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The low eventually tracked from southwest Iowa in the afternoon to east central Iowa by early evening.  To the southeast of the front, temperatures warmed into the upper 70s to mid 80s, with dew point temperatures in the upper 50s to mid 60s.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with lifted indices falling to -5 to -8 Celsius and CAPE rising to 2000-3000 J/kg.  The situation was very dynamic with a synoptic scale upper level trough to the west and broad southwest flow over the central U.S.  The jet at 300 mb was around 100 kts with 500 mb winds southwest at 75+ kts.  This aided in producing deep layer shear of 75 to 100 kts over southeast Iowa by late afternoon.  Ample inflow was present with moisture transport at the 850 mb level produced by a 35 to 40 kt flow.  This increased precipitable water values to between 1 and 1.2 inches.  Thunderstorms fired along the frontal boundary during the mid to late afternoon as the front became a cold front.  With 300-400 J/kg of CAPE in the -10 to -30 layer of the atmosphere, and 700-1000 J/kg of downdraft CAPE available, the atmosphere was loaded for the production of wind and hail.  In addition, the freezing level was a relatively low 12,000 feet.  The line of thunderstorms that formed ahead of the advancing cold front became severe quickly, producing large hail.  Much of the hail was in the 1 to 1.5 inch diameter range, however there were several reports of golf ball to tennis ball size hail.  The largest hail was over northeast Iowa with golf ball size reported in Grundy County, and tennis ball size from the northwest edge of Waterloo toward Cedar Falls in Black Hawk County.  Also in Black Hawk County, a few stones were measured to 3.5 inches in diameter in Cedar Falls.  As the system unfolded, the storms began to produce high winds.  Wind gusts of 75 to 100 MPH occurred with the stronger storms.  Multiple homes had siding damage due to hail blown through the siding, and windows were knocked out in Marion County east of Monroe.  High winds snapped power poles in Jasper and Poweshiek Counties.  A camper was blown off of Interstate 80 at mile post 178, resulting in a multiple car accident.  In Poweshiek County, cars were blown off of the road and flipped, power poles snapped, and roofs were taken off of houses near Grinnell.  Power was knocked out to several thousand customers in the Grinnell area.  Six members of the Grinnell College track team were caught in the storm and sustained injuries from the hail.  They were bruised, taken to the hospital, treated and released.  Officials in the city of Grinnell estimated damage due to the high winds from this storm at $10,000,000.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Tornado Watch number 470 was issued early Wednesday morning for far south central North Dakota as intense supercellular thunderstorms with very large hail continued to develop and move east across far southwest and south central parts of the state. The intense thunderstorms eventually transitioned from very large hail producers to damaging wind producers as they moved east of the Missouri River and towards and into the James River Valley region. ||Multiple severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings were issued. Numerous reports of large hail, including a record tying hailstone, and several reports of damaging thunderstorm winds were received during this episode. ||Damage from the very large hail was extensive and extreme. Hardest hit were Hettinger, Grant, Sioux, and Emmons Counties, where baseball to softball size hail fell. Some homes had hailstones crash completely through the roof. The large hail also killed several farm animals, and injured other livestock and pets. A North Dakota record tying hailstone, five inches in diameter, fell at Prairie Knights Resort located in eastern Sioux County. In addition, some areas in these counties experienced more than one wave of large hail. Later Wednesday morning, straight line winds up to 105 mph resulted in extensive damage over portions of Logan and LaMoure Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A North Dakota state record tying hailstone of five inches in diameter fell at Prairie Knights Casino and Resort.

At Denver International Airport alone, large hail up to golfball size, very heavy rain and wind gusts to 59 mph caused substantial damage to 40 planes and stranded approximately 1,500 passengers overnight.  Frontier and United Airlines were hardest hit as dozens of planes were taken out of service for repairs; forcing the cancellation of at least 220 flights over the next several days.  Damage to the aircrafts alone was nearly $5 million.   In addition, 83 cars in airport parking lots were damaged, along with some police cars and maintenance vehicles.  In Watkins, two people suffered minor injuries and 35 to 40 homes were damaged.  As many as 200 residents in a mobile home park were left homeless by the storm, forcing the Red Cross to open a shelter at Bennett High School.  The trailer park contained 52 mobile homes, 14 recreational vehicles, 3 houses and a commercial building.  Hailstones the size of softballs cratered the north sides of the mobile homes.  Some farmers in the area said they lost as much as 85 percent of their total wheat crop.  Power lines were also damaged which affected about 1,200 customers in Watkins.  The strong winds also flipped over a tractor-trailer rig on Interstate 70 near Watkins Road.  Insurance claims for the Watkins, Bennett and Brighton areas was estimated to be $17 million.  The total damage estimate across the entire Urban Corridor, was $164.8 million, and included 17,200 automobile claims and 12,600 homeowner claims.||In addition, thunderstorms producing very heavy rainfall, caused flash flooding in the Four Mile Canyon burn scar west of Boulder.  Three homes reportedly had water up to the windows with water flowing into structures at Fourmile Canyon Road and Gold Run Road.  The heavy rain caused a 4-ft surge along Fourmile Creek through Orodell and into the entry of Boulder Creek.  Several roads were affected which restricted access to the area.  Roads were closed due to water and debris.  Private bridges and drives were washed out and several residents were stranded and later rescued.  Numerous cars were damaged in debris flows and several structures suffered flood damage but were not destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 164.80M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The largest hail fell across the Florence area, where hailstones reached 3 inches in diameter, toward Eppley Airfield where some softball size stones fell.  The hail was accompanied by thunderstorm wind gusts that were measured at 62 mph by Asos at Eppley.  The wind driven hail caused substantial damage to vehicles and houses in eastern and northern Omaha and many cars that were parked in outdoor long-term parking at Eppley had their windows broken out by the first storm then soaked by heavy rain from the second.  Also at Eppley several commercial planes sustained hail damage and a pilot was seriously injured around his eye when a softball-size stone crashed through the passenger gate/ramp leading to a plane at the gate.  Around 270 of 600 decorative globe light along a drive toward the airport were shattered by the hail and wind, resulting in damage of around $500,000.  Hail size was smaller and possibly even absent across the western and southwestern parts of town.   According to State Farm, the largest auto insurer in Nebraska, 1,600 claims were made within a few days of the storm with more likely to follow, with most claims from the Omaha area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The fourth supercell produced hail up to 3.25 in diameter in Collin County.

Scattered thunderstorms erupted from near Ropesville northeast to the west side of Lubbock in a very short period of time after the cold front collided with the dryline. Intense lifting combined with moderate instability resulted in these storms producing large hail up to golfball size less than 15 minutes after development. One person participating in a youth softball game received a minor injury from the hail.||Strong and severe thunderstorms then quickly expanded along the length of the cold front with several reports of large hail ranging from one to two inches in diameter. This squall line continued east into the Rolling Plains before midnight CST at which point it quickly diminished in intensity.

Aside from a few raindrops and a stray flash of lightning before the hail began, witnesses said there were no clues that a hailstorm was imminent.

A squall line developed across southeast Arkansas and moved quickly across north-central Mississippi during the morning, producing multiple reports of damaging winds and ping-pong to golf ball size hail. There were reports of multiple trees blown down, some roofs blown off buildings and wind gusts of 60-80 mph, with a 77 mph wind gust measured at the Columbus AFB surface observing station. A lone supercell moved across southeast Arkansas just after 1:00 pm and showed many indications of very large hail and strong rotation. This storm gradually began making more of a right turn and continued to dive southeast across northeast Louisiana before moving into Mississippi. This storm produced multiple reports of golf ball to baseball size hail as it continued to dive southeast, shattering windows in homes and vehicles. This storm gradually weakened as another storm began to develop just to the southwest over Morehouse Parish. The storm continued to move southeast with the southern edge of the storm beginning to develop supercell characteristics. This storm became the focus of activity as it began rapidly increasing in intensity and showing signs of producing large hail. Ping pong to tennis ball size hail fell as the storm moved into northern Warren County, breaking numerous windows on vehicles near Redwood. Strong winds blew a tree on a house and caused a minor injury near Redwood. The long-lived supercell continued to move into a favorable environment and produced multiple reports of golf ball to baseball size hail along its path as it moved into the Jackson metro area. The largest hailstone was softball size, or 4.25 inches, which fell in Clinton around 3:50 pm, shattering vehicle windshields. One injury occurred in the Pinehaven community near Clinton when a baseball size hailstone fell onto a resident causing head trauma. This supercell continued to move southeast over the downtown Jackson metro area with numerous reports of golf ball to baseball size hail falling all along the path. The large hail from this supercell caused major roof damage, shattered windshields and caused dents in numerous vehicles and siding damage to multiple mobile homes in the Jackson metro area. The squall line in northeastern Mississippi produced an outflow boundary that moved to the south and southeast which would serve as a focus for additional thunderstorm development ahead of the storm moving into western Mississippi. Thunderstorms began increasing in intensity along the outflow boundary and numerous reports of large hail continued in a swath down into southern Mississippi. Reports of golf ball to baseball size hail were received along a line from Seminary to Natchez and a few golf ball size hailstones fell south of Columbia. As the actual cold front finally made its way through the I-20 corridor and south, additional hail fell during the evening. However, this hail was significantly smaller than what fell earlier, with sizes ranging from nickel to quarter size. The thunderstorms gradually moved out of the Pine Belt region late on the evening of the 18th.||An elementary school in Clinton was damaged bad enough to have to close for the remainder of the school year, and many state and local law enforcement vehicles were heavily damaged or totaled. The amount of damages to the Jackson metro area were staggering and will be remembered for years to come. The hailstone that fell in Clinton was the 3rd largest hailstone in March in Mississippi since 1950, only surpassed by a grapefruit size hailstone that fell on March 30th, 1993 in Puckett, MS and on March 6th, 1996 in Laurel, MS. It was also the 7th largest hailstone to fall in Mississippi for any month, with the largest hailstone of 5.0 inches, or CD/DVD size, falling in Lafayette County on April 10th, 1962.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This long lived storm that continued out of Warren County produced golf ball to grapefruit size hail along its path as it moved toward the Jackson metro area. The largest hailstone (4.25 inches in diameter) fell in Clinton around 3:50 pm, shattering vehicle windshields. One injury occurred in the Pinehaven community near Clinton when a baseball size hailstone fell onto a resident causing head trauma. This storm continued to move southeast over the downtown Jackson metro area with numerous reports of golfball to baseball size hail falling all along the path. The large hail from this supercell caused incredible roof damage all across the city, as well as shattering thousands of vehicle windows and windshields, as well as denting thousands of vehicles. Substantial siding damage occurred to multiple mobile homes as well. Large hail fell at Hawkins Field, causing incredible damage to aircraft that were parked on the ramp.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Some of these storms produced giant hail of 3 to 4 inches in diameter causing severe damage to crops, buildings and vehicles. Cities hit especially hard included Childress, Amherst, Littlefield, and Anton where combined property damages may exceed $10 million with regional agricultural losses approaching $50 million.

The mayor of Anton described the hail damage as the worst he had ever seen in decades of living on the Texas South Plains and declared a state of disaster. The American Red Cross said 100% of the roughly 400 homes in Anton sustained serious damage, with each home requiring on average $6,000 of repairs.  One resident of Anton was bruised by the large hail and cut by broken glass as he attempted to cover up shattered windows during the storm.  About 8,000 acres of crops in extreme northeast Hockley County were a total loss from the hail, torrential rainfall and flooding that ensued.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Heavy rainfall, strong winds, and nickel to quarter size hail was reported with this storm.

Typically, thunderstorms across the lower Arizona deserts bring strong gusty winds along with heavy rain, but in this instance the stronger storms produced episodes of large hail. The cooler atmospheric conditions, with lower freezing levels, allowed the large hail to reach the ground. Numerous reports of large hail were received from trained spotters, the public and local broadcast media. The largest hailstones ranged in diameter from 1 inch to nearly 2 inches. In some instances the large hailstones produced damage; according to the public, golf ball sized hail damaged the windows of a car and a home about 2 miles from the town of Coolidge. No injuries were reported due to the large hail.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Thunderstorms with very large hail developed to the southeast of the greater Phoenix area during the afternoon hours on October 21st. Some of the stronger storms produced hail with diameters well in excess of one inch and they affected the areas around the town of Coolidge. According to a report from the public, at 1628MST golf ball sized hailstones fell about 2 miles northeast of Coolidge and they resulted in property damage to a car and house window. At the nearby Lonestar Equestrian Center, the large hail caused minor injuries to some of the horses, and gashed the head of one of the cowboys during a roping contest. The center is located near the intersection of Attaway Road and Coolidge Avenue. The diameter of the largest hailstones was 1.75 inches. At the same time, local broadcast media reported additional large hail about 4 miles northeast of Coolidge. The media relayed a public report indicating that half-dollar sized hail had fallen in Valley Farms; the diameter of the largest hailstones was 1.25 inches.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
