The airmass became very unstable with lifted indices falling to -10 to -15 C and most unstable CAPE rising to 5000 to 6000 J/kg.  Zero to 3 km CAPE rose to over 200 J/kg in northern Iowa by the late afternoon.  Surface temperatures rose to the 80s to low 90s, as dew point values reached the upper 60s to mid 70s.  Wind fields were somewhat weak, however effective shear was in the 35 to 50 kt range by late afternoon.  The amount of CAPE in the -10 to -30 layer of the atmosphere rose to over 400 J/kg by late afternoon.  Thunderstorms erupted in two places initially.  The first was along the northern boundary.  However the severe storms with this round remained to the north of Iowa.  A second round formed north of the southern boundary along the edge of the mid level cap.  The storms became severe and produced high winds and hail.  Thunderstorms from farther west moved into Iowa later in the evening and became severe.  The storms produced a weak Derecho.  Widespread winds of 60 to 70 MPH occurred with these storms, along with numerous reports of hail of 1 to 2 inches in diameter.  The initial round of storms produced large hail and gusty winds from southwest into central Iowa.  The second round resulted in winds of 60 to 70 MPH and large hail from central into southeast Iowa.  The highest wind gust was 74 MPH, measured at an RWIS site near Ankeny in Polk County.  The wind damage was largely to trees and power lines, with spotty reports of small shed and minor building damage.  A semi-tractor trailer was blown off of Interstate 35 near Highway 210 in Story County.  The high winds ripped siding off of a house in Ankeny in Polk county, and windows were blown out of a house in Colfax in Jasper County.  Thunderstorms rekindled on the back side of the main thunderstorm area after sunrise.  A few storms became severe and produced 60 MPH winds and golf ball size hail as they moved from The Fort Dodge area into Story County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Numerous trees and power lines were down and there was considerable structural damage. A National Weather Service Storm Survey concluded that a wet microburst produced a swath of damaging straight-line winds up to 125 mph. The microburst damage began near the intersection of Wilton Drive and Gem Road. Several trees were uprooted or snapped off and minor to moderate damage was observed to roof shingles and to siding. Significant damage was observed to the east of NC Highway 72. Numerous large trees were snapped off or uprooted along NC Highway 72 and significant structural damage occurred to approximately 8 homes on Sadie Drive. One of these homes was completely destroyed and another lost its entire roof. Several sheds and outbuildings were destroyed in this area. One adult woman suffered broken bones.

Extensive tree and power line damage resulted in power outages up to several days long. Many power poles were snapped. Countywide, efforts to restore power were complicated by swampy fields, mud, and downed trees. Ninety-five percent of the county was without power at the peak of the outages. Numerous permanent structures were damaged, including major businesses in downtown Marion and Herrin. A total of 33 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed. It is estimated that over 10,000 homes in the county received minor damage (less than 50,000 dollars per house). Gas leaks were common. Most communication by phone was impossible, including cell phones. Stores were closed, making groceries and gas very difficult to obtain locally in the immediate aftermath of the storm. Travel was nearly impossible due to debris and trees blocking roads. While about two dozen people were treated for storm-related injuries at local hospitals, all but one of them was due to post-storm cleanup. Many school facilities were damaged. The roof of Carterville High School was severely damaged. Several windows were blown out of the school. Minor damage occurred at athletic facilities, including the roof blown off a baseball dugout. Many outbuildings and small structures were destroyed across the county. In Carterville, a garage was lifted and dropped on a vehicle. Many vehicles countywide were damaged or destroyed by falling tree and building debris. A state disaster declaration was granted. A dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed, and a state of emergency was declared. The Williamson County airport near Marion reported a peak gust of 86 mph. Based on the most severe structural damage east of the airport, peak winds were estimated by storm surveyors close to 100 mph. There was extensive damage at the airport, including hangar buildings. A television station on Route 13 was knocked off the air due to structural and roof damage. All along Route 13, signs were blown down, power poles were down, and windows were smashed. Car dealerships along Route 13 sustained damage due to signs falling on vehicles and windows being blown out. Numerous structures sustained varying degrees of roof damage. A large hotel near the Interstate 57 interchange sustained major roof damage. Many trees were down along Interstate 57 from the Route 13 interchange northward, blocking the southbound lanes. Semis on the interstate were overturned or blown off the highway, causing extended traffic delays. One of the drivers of the semis was seriously injured. A tree fell on a van on the interstate. Damaged or destroyed trees were too numerous to count. Cleanup was expected to last through Labor Day, according to the Mayor of Marion.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 175.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Widespread damage to trees, power lines, and structures occurred as the comma head of a bow echo moved east across the county. In the city of Carbondale alone, officials reported 34 properties were deemed total losses from the storm. All but nine of those properties were mobile homes. Damage in the city alone (excluding Southern Illinois University) was estimated near 3 million dollars. Officials estimated about 3,000 trees were down or damaged in Carbondale alone, including the campus of Southern Illinois University. Officials in Murphysboro reported 17 dwellings in that city were total losses. One mobile home was blown over onto a car. Murphysboro officials also reported a police cruiser, a truck, and a mobile command center were destroyed. The city's public works garage was shifted off its foundation, and the city police station was damaged. The peak gust recorded by the automated system at the Carbondale airport was 81 mph before the system failed. An observer at the airport visually observed a separate anemometer located on the rooftop reach 106 mph.  The automated system measured a sustained wind of 68 mph before failing. Numerous permanent structures and vehicles were damaged countywide.  Small outbuildings were destroyed. The roof of a school collapsed. Carbondale was virtually impassable due to debris. One fatality occurred on Old Route 13 in Murphysboro when a large tree limb fell on a home, knocking an elderly man down a flight of stairs and causing a severe head injury. Emergency responders were delayed by blocked roads. A state disaster declaration was granted for Jackson County. A curfew and state of emergency was declared. Cleanup was expected to take most or all of the summer. Hundreds of trees were blown down in parks, which were closed indefinitely. The preliminary damage estimate for Southern Illinois University was 5 million dollars. Many buildings on campus sustained roof damage. The storm blew out nearly 100 windows in residence halls. Countywide, efforts to restore power were complicated by swampy fields, mud, and downed trees. Eighty-seven percent of the county was without power at the peak of the outages. Widespread power and telephone outages complicated recovery efforts. Most roads were blocked by debris and downed trees. Gas stations were closed in many areas, adding to problems obtaining fuel for generators. Red Cross shelters were opened in Carbondale and Murphysboro. Major grocery stores were closed for at least 12 to 24 hours, and much of their frozen food was lost. Most communication by cell phone and land line was impossible.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several storms evolved into supercells, and produced very large hail, destructive winds, and weak tornadoes.||Thunderstorms initiated around 14:00 CST over the central South Plains, and quickly became severe with large hail initially reported in Lubbock (Lubbock County). More intense and organized supercell storms formed over the Rolling Plains by the mid to late afternoon hours, however, and moved southeastward. One particularly organized and long-lived high precipitation supercell impacted the Aspermont vicinity of Stonewall County, where it produced a swath of damaging winds and at least one tornado. A 100 mph wind gust and a corresponding 32 millibar pressure drop was measured when the tornado struck the Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet site northeast of Aspermont. Although no injuries were reportedly related to the tornado, severe gusts north of Aspermont overturned a tractor trailer truck injuring the driver.||Additional supercells impacted portions of Briscoe and Hale Counties, and very large wind-blown hail caused damages in both counties. Two tornadoes were observed by storm chasers in the Silverton and Quitaque vicinity of southern Briscoe County.  ||Total economic damages were estimated near $650,000 across the South Plains region.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A massive high precipitation supercell storm tracked southeastward over Stonewall County during the 17:00 CST hour on the 13th. The storm produced a large swath of damaging winds as it impacted areas near Aspermont. A Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet site northeast of the city sustained a direct hit from a weak tornado which was embedded within the parent mesocyclone.||Skywarn storm spotters and storm chasers initially reported thunderstorm winds estimated between 70 mph and 80 mph along U.S. Highway 83 north of Aspermont at 17:22 CST. At approximately the same time, the onset of severe 60 mph gusts occurred at the Aspermont mesonet station. Severe gusts persisted for thirty minutes at the mesonet site, and local law enforcement officials reported that a tractor-trailer was blown over near the intersection of U.S. Highways 83 and 380 northeast of Aspermont at 17:34 CST. The driver of the truck was treated for minor injuries and released. The passage of a tornado at the site was well-corroborated by detailed pressure analyses, storm chaser accounts, and post-storm surveys at 17:30 CST. Although the highest wind speeds measured by the mesonet station during the event were tornadic in nature, a peak non-tornadic wind gust of 76 mph was recorded at 17:45 CST, ten minutes after the tornado had passed.||A post-storm survey by Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet meteorologists revealed that utility poles were snapped along a three mile swath northeast of Aspermont. Minor damages to light weight structures and trailers was additionally common, along with wind damage to native mesquite trees and one center irrigation pivot system was destroyed. The most significant structural damage occurred three miles east of Aspermont just south of U.S. Highway 380, where a the roof was blown off of a well-constructed farm house and a large horse bard was substantially damaged. This damage was deemed to have most likely resulted from outflow winds given that all debris from the structures was blown downwind toward the southeast.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Though surface dew points climbed into the lower to mid 60's, extensive cloudcover along and ahead of a warm front limited instability. The instability was generally weak, characterized by cape values below 1000 j/kg.

A single-wide mobile home was completely separated from the frame, which was blown 100 yards until it struck a brick house. The sole occupant of the mobile home was a young adult who received only numerous minor abrasions that did not require hospitalization. A second nearby single-wide mobile home was blown a very short distance into trees and destroyed. This mobile home had been vacant for years. Both mobile homes were tied down. A nearby house lost most of the roof, and a large section of the windward-facing exterior wall was blown in. In the city of East Prairie, three industrial buildings were heavily damaged or destroyed. A large industrial block building was partially unroofed, a wood frame metal building was destroyed, and a wooden industrial shop was destroyed. The roof of the police department was damaged.  Numerous trees were blown down in and near East Prairie, some damaging homes. Several farm buildings received minor to major damage southwest of town. Outside of town, several irrigation pivots were blown over, a barn was damaged, and a travel trailer was overturned. An empty grain bin was blown away. The peak wind of 120 mph was supported by damage to several structures, including the industrial buildings in East Prairie and the house and mobile homes on the outskirts of town. This was among the strongest downbursts ever documented in southeast Missouri.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The persistent subtropical ridge had shifted just to the southeast of Georgia.  A cold front was near the Georgia-Tennessee border.  The front, when combined with daytime heating and the very unstable, hot air mass, provided the necessary lift for widespread and numerous showers and thunderstorms.  It turned out to be the most active day for severe thunderstorms during the month of July.  Many of the storms produced damaging downburst wind gusts, marginally severe hail, and excessive cloud-to-ground lightning.  Flash flooding was also observed with a couple of the storms.  One early morning isolated storm over Coweta county, just southwest of Atlanta, produced three to four inches of rain in a couple of hours as it persisted over the same areas near Newnan in the very early morning hours after midnight.  Flash flooding was again observed later in the day across Gwinnett county northeast of Atlanta.||Lightning was particularly intense with the thunderstorms during the afternoon of the 26th.  Gwinnett county emergency management reported 14 house fires, one business fire, and two apartment fires between 430 pm and 8 pm EDT.||In addition to the severe thunderstorms and intense lightning, very hot conditions continued across the area, especially central Georgia.  High temperatures in parts of central Georgia reached or exceeded 100 degrees, with heat index values nearing 110 during the afternoon.  The intense heat took the life of yet another individual in central Georgia, this time in Twiggs county.

The persistent subtropical ridge had shifted just to the southeast of Georgia.  A cold front was near the Georgia-Tennessee border.  The front, when combined with daytime heating and the very unstable, hot air mass, provided the necessary lift for widespread and numerous showers and thunderstorms.  It turned out to be the most active day for severe thunderstorms during the month of July.  Many of the storms produced damaging downburst wind gusts, marginally severe hail, and excessive cloud-to-ground lightning.  Flash flooding was also observed with a couple of the storms.  One early morning isolated storm over Coweta county, just southwest of Atlanta, produced three to four inches of rain in a couple of hours as it persisted over the same areas near Newnan in the very early morning hours after midnight.  Flash flooding was again observed later in the day across Gwinnett county northeast of Atlanta.||Lightning was particularly intense with the thunderstorms during the afternoon of the 26th.  Gwinnett county emergency management reported 14 house fires, one business fire, and two apartment fires between 430 pm and 8 pm EDT.||In addition to the severe thunderstorms and intense lightning, very hot conditions continued across the area, especially central Georgia.  High temperatures in parts of central Georgia reached or exceeded 100 degrees, with heat index values nearing 110 during the afternoon.  The intense heat took the life of yet another individual in central Georgia, this time in Twiggs county.  A 47-year old female died on her unshaded front porch just outside Jeffersonville, where the temperature at noon was observed to be 99 degrees.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Gwinnett County 911 Center reported that several power lines were down near Rockbridge Road and Lawrenceville Highway near Lilburn.

The setup featured a 45 knot mid level flow and a 95 knot upper level jet.  Matter of fact, a larger area of showers, associated with a warm front, had moved across southeast Ohio and West Virginia during the morning and midday hours. This kept the surface based instability at a minimum.  However, new cells formed further west during the mid afternoon over western Ohio.  It was this new cluster of convection that would intensify due to the strong mid and upper level dynamics.  Several of the new cells formed and intensified on the southern or southwestern flank of the overall larger area of showers and thunderstorms.  This area of convection stretched further to the northeast into eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania.  This allowed an unimpeded low level moisture inflow into the new development.  Surface dew points ahead of the cold front reached into the mid 60s.||Most of the severe thunderstorms exhibited strong rotation, resulting in the spawning of 5 tornadoes.  Four of these 5 tornadoes were in Ohio.  One of the 4 Ohio tornadoes crossed from Fairfield County into western Perry County.   Another 1 of the 4 crossed from Perry into northwestern Morgan County.  One tornado patch was solely in western Athens County.  The damage continued another 10 miles in Athens County from a strong rear flank downdraft.  Finally, the last of the 4 tornadoes in Ohio crossed the Ohio River from northeastern Meigs County into southern Wood County in West Virginia.  From storm surveys, this was the strongest tornado.  The last tornado path in this outbreak was solely in western West Virginia.  Luckily, there were no fatalities in southeastern Ohio.  However, there was one death on the West Virginia side of the Ohio River.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The upstream tornado lifted, as the rear flank downdraft of the rotating thunderstorm took over.  This downburst became the dominant feature in The Plains and around the community of Athens.  The width of the damage path widened to about a quarter of a mile.  Winds were estimated as high as 100 mph in The Plains.  As the storm approached, soccer players, fans, coaches, and referees took shelter in the locker rooms, the wrestling rooms, and the lounge for teachers at Athens County High School.  About a dozen adults took shelter in the concession stand.  A few of these parents were injured when the roof was heavily damaged.  The light poles, the press box, and the scoreboard were also damaged or destroyed.  On the roof of the high school, large air condition units were blown off and damaged parked cars.  Several homes were destroyed or damaged.  Roof damage was widespread.  As the wind reached the eastern sections of the town of Athens, the maximum wind gusts were estimated at 80 to 100 mph.  The last significant damage was to an automobile service and towing garage.  The total distance of this downburst was on the order of 10 miles.  A total of 6 people were injured.  About 17 homes were destroyed, many others were damaged.||Including both this downburst and the tornado, Ohio Emergency Managment Agency categorized around 30 homes as destroyed, 51 homes with major damage, and 83 homes with minor damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A state of emergency was declared and only emergency responders were permitted to travel through the southeast part of the city. It was lifted on the 18th when most streets were passable again. There was a measured wind gust of 73 mph within Perth Amboy.  A funnel cloud also passed across the city, but did not touch down.  Damage from the microburst occurred in an area bounded by 2nd Street to the west, Smith Street to the north, and the waterfront on the east and south. The most concentrated damage occurred on Water, Market and High Streets. Snapped trees and tree branches were the prevalent damage type, but roof and chimney damage also occurred in several locations. A couple of cars were also damaged by downed trees. No homes experienced significant structural damage, but several garages were badly damaged by either the winds themselves or collaterally from flying and/or falling debris. One minor injury due to flying debris occurred along First Street. The worst damage was located in a two-block area bounded by Second Street, Gordon Street, Madison Avenue and Lewis Street. Several large trees and numerous power lines were blown down, and structural damage occurred to several garages. Numerous houses in this area suffered roof damage, mainly in the form of lost shingles and damaged or destroyed chimneys. Several homes had sections of roofs torn away. A roof was also torn from one industrial building along Second Street, portions of which were transported several blocks away. Extensive tree damage also occurred in and near Bayview Park. Personnel from the city of Perth Amboy and the city of Woodbridge worked through the night to clean up the storm debris.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A very unstable air mass was present over South Texas (CAPE values from 4500 to 5500 J/kg).  At 7 pm CDT, the first line of thunderstorms entered the Rio Grande Valley and produced hail up to the size of nickels, localized flooding and strong winds.  The second line of thunderstorms extended across much of Central Texas and began accelerating and tracking southward from Tilden to Goliad by late in the evening.  The two lines of thunderstorms merged around Tilden and Choke Canyon Reservoir near 1000 pm CDT causing intensification to the convective complex of storms.  This was evident by severe storms over Live Oak and Bee counties with increased reflectivity and cloud to ground lightning between 1030 and 1100 pm CDT.  At the same time, the northern|line of thunderstorms continued through the Victoria Crossroads area and slowly weakened.||The strongest portion of the solid line of thunderstorms continued southeastward into the central Coastal Bend. Reports of trees down and power outages increased from along I-37 to Corpus Christi from the most intense portion of the line of thunderstorms.  WSR-88D detected small areas of rotation over Aransas, San Patricio and Nueces Counties between 1100 and  midnight CDT when tornado warnings were issued.  Wind gusts of 60 mph were common from automated weather stations as the storms slammed the lower Coastal Bend.  Power outages from the wind were significant by midnight and there were many reports of trees and power lines down, and rescue operations for recreational trailers that were tipped over on the base of Navy Corpus Christi and a flipped 18-wheeler. In this area, automated sensors measured wind as high as 80 mph.  The lightning was intense and continuous|at times, which caused additional damage to a few structures. The line of thunderstorms produced widespread 1 to 2 inches of rain across South Texas with locally higher amounts. Total cloud to ground lightning strikes observed by|the National Lightning Detection Network were near 38,000 from 800 pm to 200 am CDT.  In Nueces County up to 31,000 residence had interruption to their power according to AEP.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An NWS storm survey team concluded 80-90 mph winds occurred on NAS Corpus Christi, producing damage consistent with straight-line winds.  4 recreational vehicles were flipped and several others moved.  6 people were injured, with one of them receiving critical injuries.  Also, debris from a boast barn was blown into the Laguna Madre, and actual boats tossed into a nearby parking lot.  The survey team also observed numerous trees damaged or uprooted through NAS Corpus Christi.  In addition, one hangar door was blown off its tracks.  Finally, the team observed tree and sign damage in Flour Bluff, as well as a car port and roof of a nearby apartment complex damaged.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The line, which raced east at 60 to 70 mph, produced widespread winds of 40 to 60 mph along and north of Interstate 70.  Storm assessment teams from the National Weather Service in St. Louis evaluated the most intense damage which occurred over northeast Missouri and west central Illinois.  From the extreme damage that occurred in localized areas, it appears that wind speeds reached 70 to 100 mph. The extensive nature of the damage caused power outages to at least 55,000 customers. Some did not have power return until Tuesday night.  Also, there were several reports of flash flooding, especially over northeastern Missouri due to the already saturated soils from previous rains over the past week.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An intense bow echo moved through Coatsburg, Camp Point and Clayton.  Hundreds of trees, tree limbs and power lines were blown down.  A couple of power poles were also snapped off.  Several trees and tree limbs landed on homes causing minor to moderate roof damage.  Also, in Camp Point the entire roof of a business was blown off.  One woman was injured after falling down her basement steps as her family was taking shelter from the storm.  It took more than an hour for an ambulance to respond to the woman's home near Coatsburg because of the downed trees blocking highways and lots of secondary roads.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous trees and power lines were blown down across the central portion of the county. Some of these trees were down on homes and across roads. One tree fatally injured a person at Jeff Busby Park.

This trough eventually set the stage for the historical and catastrophic tornado outbreak that commenced just two days later on the 27th.  On this day, however, the atmosphere across Georgia, being unseasonably warm and humid, supported widespread development of pulse-type thunderstorms.  Several of these storms became strong to severe and produced large hail and damaging downburst winds.

Other damage was noted from the Willow Bend residential area to Corporate Ridge Industrial Park.  Over 100 large mature trees, many oaks and pines, were either uprooted or split within a two to three square mile-wide area.   Several mobile homes were heavily damaged, including two of which were destroyed when large trees crushed them.  Several fences and metal gates were also destroyed when smashed by the large fallen trees.  WRBL Television reported that two injuries occurred at one of the mobile homes crushed by a large tree.  WTVM also noted wind damage just northeast of Bibb City as well, where a few more large trees were down, one of which crushed a fence.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 350.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Floyd County Emergency Management Director reported that strong thunderstorm winds, likely well in excess of 60 mph, caused widespread and extensive damage across the county.  Some of the worst damage was in the Cave Spring area.  All together, 157 homes and 13 commercial buildings sustained minor to moderate damage or were destroyed, many from downed trees.  Four injuries were reported during this event, three which occurred when a large tree fell on a vehicle and a fourth when a large tree fell on a home and injured an elderly lady.  Over 300 trees were down across the county causing 32 roads to be closed.  Over 15,000 homes and many businesses across the county were left without power for several hours.  Both Shorter University and Berry College were closed as neither institution had any power at the start of the business day.  The Emergency Manager estimated that monetary damages from this countywide thunderstorm wind event exceeded the damage that occurred later in the day with an EF2 tornado, during which the damage was more localized.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system had been slowing moving through the Southern Plains and Midwest in the prior days and had wreaked havoc on that region in the form of many devastating tornadoes, including the EF5 Joplin, Missouri tornado of May 22nd.  As this system spread east, it was weakening in the face of a long standing upper ridge across the southeast U.S. and also moving into a considerably less favorable surface environment.  Nonetheless, it remained a strong upper-level system with decent dynamics.  It brought the most severe weather to the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast office since the historical tornado outbreak of April 27th and 28th.  There were numerous reports of golf ball and larger-sized hail across north Georgia during the afternoon of April 26th which translated mostly into a thunderstorm wind event as the system spread thunderstorm further south across central Georgia during the late evening hours.||Showers and thunderstorms continued during the overnight hours of the 26th and into the early morning hours of the 27th.  By afternoon, the front had pushed into the east central and southeast part of the county warning area.  With afternoon heating and increased instability, thunderstorms increased in intensity and coverage ahead of the front.  Some of these once again became severe.  These were confined to the southeast counties of the county warning area.  Quarter to half-dollar-sized hail was the primary severe weather component of these second round storms.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Fulton County Emergency Management Director and the public reported that at least a dozen trees were down across the north part of the county in the Buckhead and Sandy Springs areas.  A number of roads were blocked from downed trees, especially across the northern part of the county.  Two females in their 60s were killed when a large tree fell on their Mazda Miata sports car while traveling on West Paces Ferry Road at Nancy Creek Road, approximately four miles west-northwest of Buckhead.  A downed tree limb on the MARTA tracks near the Arts Center Station caused delays for southbound trains.  Several power lines were also down across the area with thousands of residents across the county left without power for several hours, many even into the next day.  In addition, a UPS truck was set on fire when a large tree fell on the vehicle.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At least eight utility poles were broken by fallen trees. A building under construction in Sesser was levelled. Some homes and businesses in and near Sesser lost shingles. Due to power outages and debris on roads, a curfew was issued for Sesser. All of the damage was in the northern part of town. An 18-foot camper at Wayne Fitzgerrell campground on Rend Lake was overturned, injuring one person. In Sesser, a man removing a tree from a roof was injured during the cleanup (indirect injury).

This epic event broke the record for number of tornadoes in a day for the state of Alabama, becoming the most significant tornado outbreak in the state���s history. ||Central Alabama had two rounds of severe weather that day. During the early morning hours, a Quasi-Linear Convective System quickly moved across the northern half of the National Weather Service, Birmingham county warning area. Straight line winds of 90 mph (78kts) or greater and 11 tornadoes lead to widespread damage and power outages. During the afternoon, long-lived supercell thunderstorms produced long-track, strong and violent tornadoes. Destruction and loss of life across many towns and communities was devastating. ||The hardest hit areas included Shottsville and Hackleburg, both in Marion County, where winds of 160 mph and 210 mph respectively, caused unimagineable damage. Cordova, in Walker County, was hit twice; by a tornado along the Quasi-Linear Convective System during the early morning hours and again in the afternoon by a long-track EF4 tornado. A long track tornado moved across the city of Tuscaloosa and the western suburbs of Birmingham, resulting in the complete destruction of whole neighborhoods and numerous injuries and fatalities in those heavily populated areas. The same parent supercell produced another violent tornado in east Central Alabama as it tracked across St. Clair and Calhoun Counties, resulting in additional fatalities and incredible damage to a number of neighborhoods. Another violent EF4 tornado tracked across portions of Elmore and Tallapoosa Counties, including Lake Martin, destroying numerous homes and a large section of a mobile home park. ||Most of the violent tornadoes from this day were captured on video by a number of people, including storm spotters and chasers, as well as numerous television news crews and remotely controlled web-enabled video cameras.  This allowed unprecedented coverage and viewing of this historic event in real time from people worldwide.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous trees were knocked down across the county, some on homes and businesses.

Thunderstorms developed during the mid afternoon hours due to the building heat and instability and lake breeze convergence.  The first of the thunderstorms developed near Holland around 4 p.m. just a couple miles inland of Lake Michigan where the convergence was the strongest.  Numerous additional thunderstorms developed in the zone of lake breeze convergence.  The storms eventually congealed into a line of storms which marched eastward across the area during the early to mid evening hours.  ||The storms produced winds of up to around 60 mph in some localized locations.  A gust to near 50 mph at the Gerald R Ford Airport in Grand Rapids produced damage to a couple of hangars that injured four people who were in the hangars at the time.  The storms also produced some hail, with the biggest hail stones measuring over two inches in diameter in Muskegon and just east of Bangor.  ||The most significant issue with the storms however was heavy rainfall.  A storm that produced very heavy rainfall and did not move very fast in eastern Ottawa county from Allendale to near Marne produced 3 to locally 5 inches of rain within a two hour time frame.  This created flooding on parts of the campus of Grand Valley State University, and produced standing water on the roads in Allendale and Tallmadge township in Ottawa county.  Some other areas that received the highest rainfall totals were near the intersection of Isabella, Montcalm and Gratiot counties.  Western Calhoun county also received significant rainfall and portions of the aforementioned areas saw up to 5 inches of rain falling in a 2 to 3 hour time frame.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Thunderstorm wind gusts caused two civilian hangars to become damaged and collapse at the Gerald R. Ford International Airport, causing four injuries.  Three of the four were treated on the scene and released but one person who incurred more significant injuries and a head laceration was taken to the hospital.   The damage occurred at the north end of the airport and affected a row of general aviation hangers.  The injuries occurred due to debris from the two hangars that collapsed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

During the early morning hours, a Quasi-Linear Convective System quickly moved across the northern half of the National Weather Service, Birmingham county warning area. Straight line winds of 90 mph (78kts) or greater and 11 tornadoes lead to widespread damage and power outages. During the afternoon, long-lived supercell thunderstorms produced long-track, strong and violent tornadoes. Destruction and loss of life across many towns and communities was devastating. ||The hardest hit areas included Shottsville and Hackleburg, both in Marion County, where winds of 160 mph and 210 mph respectively, caused unimagineable damage. Cordova, in Walker County, was hit twice; by a tornado along the Quasi-Linear Convective System during the early morning hours and again in the afternoon by a long-track EF4 tornado. A long track tornado moved across the city of Tuscaloosa and the western suburbs of Birmingham, resulting in the complete destruction of whole neighborhoods and numerous injuries and fatalities in those heavily populated areas. The same parent supercell produced another violent tornado in east Central Alabama as it tracked across St. Clair and Calhoun Counties, resulting in additional fatalities and incredible damage to a number of neighborhoods. Another violent EF4 tornado tracked across portions of Elmore and Tallapoosa Counties, including Lake Martin, destroying numerous homes and a large section of a mobile home park. ||Most of the violent tornadoes from this day were captured on video by a number of people, including storm spotters and chasers, as well as numerous television news crews and remotely controlled web-enabled video cameras.

A very warm and unstable atmosphere was in place across the Mid-South ahead of the front. A low pressure system developed along the front and interacted with the unstable environment which helped produce several rounds of severe storms into the evening of April 26th, 2011. As a result of the severe storms, the front sank south during the early morning hours of April 27th, 2011 as a secondary low pressure system developed along the front. As a result, another round of severe storms fired during the afternoon hours ahead of the low pressure center. Additional severe storms fired along the trailing cold front. Tornadoes, large hail, damaging winds, flash flooding occurred as a result of the severe storms.  Heavy rain from the continuous rounds of severe weather eventually resulted in record river flooding on a number of rivers in the region.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Straight line winds produced widespread damage in Henry County.

Moderate wind shear with 0-6km shear values of 35 to 45 knots and mixed layer (ML) CAPE in the 1500 to 2500J/kg range in place over the region combined with enhanced lift from an upper disturbance rotating through the base of an approaching upper trough to produce strong to severe supercell thunderstorms during the afternoon into the evening of June 21st. The storms produced two EF1 tornadoes in the vicinity of the nearly-stationary warm front that tracked along the border between Fond Du Lac County and Green Lake County. The severe thunderstorms also produced large hail and damaging wind gusts, including a 2-mile wide microburst across sections of Waukesha County that damaged homes, barns and felled thousands of trees and numerous power lines. In addition, the thunderstorms fed off a moisture-rich air mass moving into the region, with precipitable water values around 1.8 inch, that also produced heavy rainfall and flash flooding in portions of Waukesha and Milwaukee counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 2-mile wide swath of damage was caused by a microburst associated with a bowing line of severe thunderstorms that tracked from southwest to northeast across a large portion of Waukesha County. Wind gusts estimated up to between 100 to 110 mph (87 to 96 knots) dropped thousands of trees, damaged homes and barns and blew down power lines that left 10,000 customers without power in Waukesha County. One person was injured by airborne tree debris near the Pewaukee and Delafield town borders. A semi-trailer truck was blown over on Interstate-94 in Waukesha County, while two other high-profile vehicles were nearly blown over by the strong winds, but concrete construction barriers saved the vehicles from being completely blown over.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 276.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This event was forced by unseasonably strong wind fields associated with a potent extra-tropical cyclone that was formerly Tropical Storm Lee.  Post-tropical cyclone Lee was moving slowly toward the east-northeast along the north central Gulf Coast during the morning hours of September 5, 2011.  By 3:00 pm EDT (1900 UTC), the cyclone was centered near Mobile Bay.  It was at this point that the system finally began to accelerate off to the northeast.  While tornadoes were initially considered to be the primary threat, examination of a special 1800 UTC KTAE sounding showed that low level winds had veered and that the flow was unidirectional through a deep layer.  WFO Tallahassee coordinated with the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) to replace the existing tornado watch with a severe thunderstorm watch at 4:00 pm EDT (2000 UTC).  WFO Tallahassee issued a total of 35 convective warnings during the event along with several special marine warnings.  A total of 52 severe weather reports were received across southeast Alabama, southwest and south central Georgia, and the Florida panhandle and big bend.  ||Aside from the severe weather, the forecast area experienced other peripheral impacts from post-tropical storm Lee. Widespread storm-total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches was measured across the Florida panhandle and big bend, with 1 to 2 inch totals more common across the Alabama and Georgia portions of the CWA.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tree was blown down onto a house with injuries on Ross Clark Circle SE.

This event was forced by unseasonably strong wind fields associated with a potent extra-tropical cyclone that was formerly Tropical Storm Lee.  Post-tropical cyclone Lee was moving slowly toward the east-northeast along the north central Gulf Coast during the morning hours of September 5, 2011.  By 3:00 pm EDT (1900 UTC), the cyclone was centered near Mobile Bay.  It was at this point that the system finally began to accelerate off to the northeast.  While tornadoes were initially considered to be the primary threat, examination of a special 1800 UTC KTAE sounding showed that low level winds had veered and that the flow was unidirectional through a deep layer.  WFO Tallahassee coordinated with the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) to replace the existing tornado watch with a severe thunderstorm watch at 4:00 pm EDT (2000 UTC).  WFO Tallahassee issued a total of 35 convective warnings during the event along with several special marine warnings.  A total of 52 severe weather reports were received across southeast Alabama, southwest and south central Georgia, and the Florida panhandle and big bend.  ||Aside from the severe weather, the forecast area experienced other peripheral impacts from post-tropical storm Lee. Widespread storm-total rainfall of 3 to 6 inches was measured across the Florida panhandle and big bend, with 1 to 2 inch totals more common across the Alabama and Georgia portions of the CWA.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Trees and power lines were blown down county wide.  A woman was injured when she was struck by a falling tree limb in hunt camp.

A favorable setup for severe thunderstorm activity, developed in the mid-section of the country. Very warm and humid air lifted northward into the region, while cooler air lingered in the western Great Lakes. The battleground between these two types of air mass, established itself from Nebraska to western Iowa, northern Kansas, and northern Missouri.||Severe thunderstorms developed during the evening and overnight hours of Thursday August 18th and 19th, 2011.  Scattered supercell thunderstorms developed over eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, producing very large hail and heavy rain. While this soon to be large cluster of thunderstorms was beginning to develop over western Nebraska, an isolated supercell drifted towards the city of Maryville, Missouri.  As this storm rolled through the city,  winds greater than 80 mph even approaching 100 mph created extreme damage. This storm crushed numerous corn fields and produced extensive hail damage. Quickly filling in behind this supercell was the aforementioned developing mesoscale convective system, or MCS, capable of producing extreme winds. This system quickly became organized and pushed from north to south down the Missouri river. Winds were estimated between 60 and 80 mph, as damage was reported from St. Joseph to Leavenworth, and across the Kansas City metropolitan area. Extensive tree and powerline damage was reported, with upwards of 100,000 customers without power, at the height of the event.  This storm system, even knocked down the primary radio tower, for the Missouri State Patrol in St. Joseph, Missouri.||This thunderstorm complex continued to push south and east, finally reaching the Missouri State Fair around 1 am Friday morning. Measured winds of 62 mph caused havoc at the fairgrounds, blowing over tents and leading to the evacuation of the nearby campers and campgrounds. Damage cleanup at the fairgrounds, caused the fair to open up their gates, well into the daytime hours of Friday.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A gas station awning was blown down. Two injuries were reported in a car underneath the fallen awning. Thunderstorm wind gusts were estimated up to 70 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Very strong cyclonically curved winds in the mid-levels of the atmosphere near 115 mph and a rapidly deepening surface low over Louisiana and Mississippi aided in strong low-level wind shear and destabilization for severe thunderstorm development. Early Christmas morning, a large elevated rain and thunderstorm shield overspread the entire ArkLaMiss region. A warm front pushed north through southern Louisiana and Mississippi through late morning and through the afternoon while a quickly advancing cold front and developing squall line were occurring across portions of Texas and Louisiana. A Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) Tornado Watch was issued for all of southern Louisiana and Mississippi late Christmas morning for the expected potency of the rotating thunderstorms. Supercells began to develop ahead of the squall line across southern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama south of the warm front during the afternoon. With such ample wind and speed shear, strong tornadoes developed that afternoon. The most notable tornadoes in NWS Jackson's area were two EF2 tornadoes in Lawrence and southern Forrest counties that destroyed several mobile homes and campers, snapped power poles, and uprooted or snapped hundreds of trees. Luckily, no fatalities occurred in association with the tornadoes. The tornado damage in Forrest County was part of a 61 mile long tornado that began in Pearl River County Mississippi, where EF-3 damage occurred, and ended in western Greene County. Numerous trees were reported down across much of central Mississippi from the advancing squall line and its damaging straight-line winds. Flash flooding also occurred across many areas leading to road closures. The severe weather and cold front finally cleared Mississippi by early Christmas evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A large tree fell on a house in Edwards causing heavy damage.

The first area of concentrated damage, consisting of dozens of downed trees, occurred along Kinney Road about 1 mile east of the intersection with Corcoran road. The second concentrated area of microburst damage occurred along Hickox and Grover Hollow Roads. At this location, seven homes sustained minor structural damage. The maximum estimated wind speeds associated with the microburst damage was 90 mph. ||An 66-year-old Andover, NY, woman was killed while trying to evacuate her family from a campsite located along Wintergreen Road in Hickox. Officials said the woman was fastening her Great Grand-daughter into a safety-seat in her vehicle after receiving a text message alerting her of a tornado warning. The woman and her two Grandchildren, ages 19 and 20, were planning on evacuating the campsite, but she was struck by a falling tree in the process. Authorities said the tree struck the Grandmother in the head, killing her instantly. She was pronounced dead at the scene by Potter County Coroner. Witnesses said the tree was struck by lightning before falling. One of her Grand-daughters was also struck and injured by the falling tree while attempting to help her Grandmother.

These storms moved into the Rio Grande Plains toward noon, then linked up with additional lift from an approaching wind shift line drifting south from the South Texas Plains. Feeding on a very unstable atmosphere  - cold and dry air well above the earth���s surface - initial storms would slam Zapata County during lunchtime with damaging wind, large hail, flooding rain, and frequent lightning. As the afternoon progressed, increasing contrast between cooler air across the South Texas Plains (60s and 70s) with the last of the early May heat in the Rio Grande Valley (90s) set the stage for additional storms with damaging winds and flooding rain in Zapata, and culminated with a monster supercell thunderstorm which cruised from southwest Brooks County through Raymondville before weakening.||This impressive supercell storm dominated the episode, and produced a measured instantaneous wind gust over 100 mph in rural Hidalgo County. Fortunately for the populated middle Valley, where more than 700,000 persons are at risk, this cell slid through northern Hidalgo County north of the SR 186 and U.S. 281 interchange, and accelerated through the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge northeast of Linn and San Manuel before reaching Raymondville (Willacy County). The cell quickly weakened by the end of dinner hour (6 to 7 PM CDT) before reaching the Laguna Madre and Gulf of Mexico.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A semi trailer was blown over on US 281, 6 miles north of TX HWY 186. Driver of semi was injured. Driver stated that he had pulled onto the shoulder due to blinding rain and pelting hail and soon after, the downburst moved the trailer onto the dirt shoulder and then turned over. The trailer was carrying 5 tons of cargo (vacuum cleaners) and at least 200 gallons of diesel, which had to be removed from the scene.||The Precinct Constable, who lives about a mile southwest of the trailer incident, reported numerous asphalt shingles pulled from the northwest facing roof, and one window was blown out. Numerous mesquite trees were snapped or had large healthy limbs broken and healthy ebony and oak trees were also damaged on the ranch. Heavy cable was torn out of a telephone tower (0.2 miles SE of the ranch house) at an estimated height of 200 feet above the ground.||A peak instantaneous wind gust of 102 mph was recorded at a 10 meter temporary wind platform as the microburst surged through.  The same platform recorded 35 minutes of wind gusts to 50 mph or higher; the platform was less than one half mile from the Constable's house.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A weak frontal boundary extended from northern Indiana into western Pennsylvania.  Abundant moisture (1.75-2.00 PWAT), strong instability (SBCAPE 4000-5000 J/kg), moderate shear (40kts 0-6km), and a short wave just south of the boundary provided the ingredients for a long-tracked mesoscale convective system, classified by the Storm Prediction Center as a derecho, to track all the way from northern Indiana across eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania, northern WV, and western Maryland. As the MCS crossed the area, widespread wind damage was reported across areas primarily south and west of Pittsburgh. There were several reports of structural damage and damage led to a fatality when a barn collapsed in Muskingum county. Power outages were widespread with up to 130,000 outages reported immediately after the storms passage, most of which, were in Ohio. Muskingum and Guernsey counties sustained $712,000 and $500,000 in damages respectively. This also became on of the the costliest disasters to hit Ohio, right behind Hurricane Ike in 2008.  Across West Virginia, the following was the preliminary damage for public assistance only:  Marion $171,000, Marshall $138,000, Monongalia $57,000, Preston $123,000, Tucker $52,000, Wetzel $286,000.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Emergency manager reported that a mobile home slid off of it's foundation.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The storms produced a swath of wind and hail damage in a narrow corridor just to the east of a Princeton to Evansville line. The storms developed along and ahead of a cold front as it advanced south-southeast through central Illinois and central Indiana during the late afternoon. Temperatures reached the upper 90's to near 100 degrees ahead of the storms, resulting in a rather unstable air mass with mixed-layer capes up to 2500 j/kg. Moderately strong winds aloft supported multicell thunderstorms and an occasional supercell structure. Strong surface heating steepened low-level lapse rates, and low relative humidity near the ground enhanced the threat for strong downbursts.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A very destructive macroburst with winds estimated up to 110 mph snapped or uprooted thousands of trees. Hundreds of structures were damaged. A total of 78 structures received major damage such as loss of roof decking or porches, and 249 sustained minor damage such as loss of shingles or minor siding loss. Dozens of barns and sheds were heavily damaged or destroyed. The macroburst damage was concentrated in Oakland City. The damage area extended south to the Warrick County line. In Oakland City, a tree was down on a trailer with residents still inside. The damage path was 3.5 miles wide and 12 miles long. One person was injured due to wind, and three people were injured by hail. All of the injuries occurred in Oakland City, and all were treated at hospitals. Roads were blocked by debris, including State Route 57. Two miles south of Oakland City, part of a roof was on a roadway.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 6.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A two-vehicle accident, with two injuries, occurred when the driver of one vehicle swerved to avoid an already downed tree. Falling trees and limbs injured three others at the Middle Creek Campground. Unknown causes resulted in three additional people taken to medical facilities.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 600.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A weak frontal boundary extended from northern Indiana into western Pennsylvania.  Abundant moisture (1.75-2.00 PWAT), strong instability (SBCAPE 4000-5000 J/kg), moderate shear (40kts 0-6km), and a short wave just south of the boundary provided the ingredients for a long-tracked mesoscale convective system, classified by the Storm Prediction Center as a derecho, to track all the way from northern Indiana across eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania, northern WV, and western Maryland. As the MCS crossed the area, widespread wind damage was reported across areas primarily south and west of Pittsburgh. There were several reports of structural damage and damage led to a fatality when a barn collapsed in Muskingum county. Power outages were widespread with up to 130,000 outages reported immediately after the storms passage, most of which, were in Ohio. Muskingum and Guernsey counties sustained $712,000 and $500,000 in damages respectively. This also became on of the the costliest disasters to hit Ohio, right behind Hurricane Ike in 2008.  Across West Virginia, the following was the preliminary damage for public assistance only:  Marion $171,000, Marshall $138,000, Monongalia $57,000, Preston $123,000, Tucker $52,000, Wetzel $286,000.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Emergency management reported numerous trees down throughout the county.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Two of the four supercells tracked through Dallas County causing over a billion dollars in hail damage. The hail in Dallas County ranged in sizes up to 3 in diameter. In many areas, the hail lasted for at least 30 minutes. Tens of thousands of cars were damaged by the hail, windows were shattered, roofs were damaged, and trees were shredded of their leaves. The Lakewood area of Dallas was one of the hardest hit areas. Part of the Lakewood Theater was damaged, and thousands of divots damaged the golf course at the Lakewood Country Club. Historic homes on Swiss Avenue sustained significant roof damage with roof repairs on a few homes estimated over $100,000. A glass exhibit at the Dallas Arboretum sustained damage that was described as relatively minor. This supercell continued to track into Ellis County producing hail damage down to Midlothian. The second supercell in Dallas County tracked from Irving into Cedar Hill. Another supercell produced an EF-0 tornado, 70-95 mph downburst winds, and softball sized hail in Fannin County. The fourth supercell produced hail up to 3.25 in diameter in Collin County. Damage estimates were estimated as high as $2 billion dollars for this event, but insurance companies anticipated the final damage totals to be around $1.1 billion. One head injury was reported when the hail broke through the sunroof of a car.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Damaging downburst winds between 70 to 95 mph caused damage along a line from approximately 1.5 miles north of Randolph to 2 miles east-southeast of Leonard. Many trees were snapped or uprooted along the path and several barns and outbuildings either lost much of their roofs or were overturned. Four manufactured homes were rolled over along the path of destructive winds, and a few more homes sustained damage to the roofs and/or siding. The homes that rolled over were located near FM 1553 and CR 4709 north of Leonard, near CR 4860 and 4855 east of Leonard, and two homes rolled over on CR 4851 east of Leonard. A total of three people were injured from the rolling homes.

This outbreak was very dynamically driven with very minimal instability values. However this lack of instability was overcome by a 150 mph tropical jet streak, a negatively tilted mid-level trough, 45 mph low level jet, and the presence of a surface warm front and cold front. ||Thunderstorm initiated over eastern New Mexico as single cells, but transitioned into a linear structure along the leading edged of a surface cold front as they entered the western Texas Panhandle.  Once transitioned into a linear structure, severe thunderstorm wind gusts became the primary threat. This was reflected in the storm reports as numerous thunderstorm wind gusts and wind damage were received, but only one report of 1 inch hail was received. The first report of damage for the outbreak was south-southwest of the town of Vega (Deaf Smith County) where thunderstorm downdrafts blew over center pivots used for irrigation. Several more reports of thunderstorm winds gusts between 60 and 70 mph were received from Deaf Smith, Randall, Potter, and Oldham Counties as the line of thunderstorms moved across the southern Texas Panhandle. In Oldham County three tractor trailers were overturned on US Highway 385 north of the city of Vega.   ||As the thunderstorms moved across Potter and Randall County thunderstorm wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were reported all across the counties. Two additional tractor trailers rollover accidents were reported on Interstate 27 between Amarillo (Randall County) and Canyon (Randall County), and at the intersection of McAfee Road and Washington Street on the southeast side of Amarillo (Randall County). The accident at McAfee Road and Washington Street resulted in one fatality. Given the west to east track of the line of thunderstorms, vehicles on north-south running roads faced the most hazardous driving conditions due to cross winds, and as a result all rollovers reported occurred on north-south roads. ||Also the turbulent winds near this line of thunderstorm contributed to an aircraft mishap over Armstrong County. The pilot, a locally known dentist from Colorado Springs, Co, and the passenger, the pilot���s father, were killed when their double prop Beechcraft E-90 airplane had an in-flight break-up according to a preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board. The report went on to state that the turbulent air flows caused the aircraft to experience updrafts and downdrafts that tore the fuselage apart. Wreckage from the aircraft were located near the city of Claude (Armstrong County).||As the line of thunderstorms reached the eastern edge of Potter and Randall County, they reached the intersection of the cold front and warm front. The additional low level shear provided by this intersection allowed for three brief tornadoes to form in southern Carson County and central Donley County. The tornado in Carson County lasted 5 minutes and traveled three miles without causing any damage. However a trained spotter provided photographic evidence of its occurrence. Two tornadoes occurred in Donley County; one near Clarendon and another near Lelia Lake. Both lasted a minute in duration but were able to produce noticeable structural damage. All three tornadoes were classified as EF-0. ||By 6 PM CST, the line of thunderstorms became disorganized as the upper level dynamics moved further to the northeast, and no further reports of damage or severe gusts were received.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 69 mph thunderstorm winds gusts estimated via radar caused a tractor trailer rollover accident at the intersection of McAfee Road and Washington Street in Amarillo (Randall County). The tractor trailer was traveling south along Washington Street as a line of thunderstorms moved from west to east across Amarillo. The line of thunderstorms produced a downdraft which struck the tractor trailer perpendicular to its path of travel causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle. The driver of the semi-tractor trailer died as a result of the rollover.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Very strong cyclonically curved winds in the mid-levels of the atmosphere near 115 mph and a rapidly deepening surface low over Louisiana and Mississippi aided in strong low-level wind shear and destabilization for severe thunderstorm development. Early Christmas morning, a large elevated rain and thunderstorm shield overspread the entire ArkLaMiss region. A warm front pushed north through southern Louisiana and Mississippi through late morning and through the afternoon while a quickly advancing cold front and developing squall line were occurring across portions of Texas and Louisiana. A Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) Tornado Watch was issued for all of southern Louisiana and Mississippi late Christmas morning for the expected potency of the rotating thunderstorms. Supercells began to develop ahead of the squall line across southern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama south of the warm front during the afternoon. With such ample wind and speed shear, strong tornadoes developed that afternoon. The most notable tornadoes in NWS Jackson's area were two EF2 tornadoes in Lawrence and southern Forrest counties that destroyed several mobile homes and campers, snapped power poles, and uprooted or snapped hundreds of trees. Luckily, no fatalities occurred in association with the tornadoes. The tornado damage in Forrest County was part of a 61 mile long tornado that began in Pearl River County Mississippi, where EF-3 damage occurred, and ended in western Greene County. Numerous trees were reported down across much of central Mississippi from the advancing squall line and its damaging straight-line winds. Flash flooding also occurred across many areas leading to road closures. The severe weather and cold front finally cleared Mississippi by early Christmas evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tree fell on a mobile home west of Epps along LA Highway 134, fatally injuring one man inside.

The associated surface low tracked northeast from Kansas across northern Missouri to southern Wisconsin. Ahead of the low and trough, a south-southwesterly low-level jet in excess of 50 knots expanded east across the Mid-Mississippi Valley. An expansive quasi-linear convective system formed along the lead cold front trailing southward from the surface low. Despite rather meager instability, very strong low and mid-level wind fields resulted in organized storm structures with pockets of damaging wind, isolated large hail, and a couple of tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A large section of roof was blown off a house. The roof was a flat roof with no anchors and a rather large overhang. Debris fell on one occupant of the house, who was treated at a local hospital for minor injuries such as scrapes and bruises. The house was damaged extensively. Nearby, three barns and a large tool shed were damaged or destroyed. Two of the barns were old wooden barns that were pushed and leaning over, but still on their foundations. The third barn was an old wooden barn that was destroyed. The tool shed was a steel-frame structure that was heavily damaged on one end. Beams were bent, and siding was torn off. Several small trees were uprooted along Highway 81, and one tree was snapped. Emergency responders could not reach the damaged house and injured person until debris was cleared from the road. All debris was blown toward the east-northeast. The damage swath was one-half to three-quarters of a mile wide.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 80.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

South winds that had developed over the southern plains tried to bring moisture northward, but quality moisture was lacking, which kept the severe thunderstorm potential more of a marginal threat. A pacific cold front began advancing east through Oklahoma during the late morning hours, with thunderstorms developing over parts of west-central Oklahoma by early afternoon. The thunderstorms were quick moving, and had moved near the I-35 corridor by 3 to 4 pm. Sporadic marginally severe hail was reported, although most locations received much small hail. The main concern with the thunderstorms was the wind. Winds ahead of the front were already gusting over 30 mph. Just off the surface, much higher wind speeds were present. At times, some of the stronger winds would come down to the surface. Strong winds caused isolated areas of damage, with one area near Edmond, Oklahoma, and the other east of Ada, Oklahoma. The non-tornadic winds east of Ada approached 100 mph, causing substantial damage to a double-wide trailer. The damage was local however, with very little damage in the surrounding areas. The storms moved into eastern Oklahoma by the early evening hours.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Information provided by a NWS Storm Survey team and local radar confirmed that a strong microburst occurred near the Happyland community. A strapped down, double-wide was destroyed by the intense winds, with debris scattered 100 to 150 yards. Unfortunately, two people were inside the mobile home when it was destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A Winter Storm Watch was issued for the Southern Sierra Nevada, and Tioga Pass was closed on the 17th; this was the latest date on record that the Pass had been open until.||A weak upper-level trough moved through the central California interior during the night of January 19th-20th. While the trough brought less rain than the computer models had indicated, it did knock down the ridge that had been in place over the state.|The second trough arrived during the evening of the 20th. From midnight to 4 AM on the 21st, 0.63 inch of rain fell on Fresno, a record-setting end to a 60-day stretch without measurable rain. The total rainfall for Fresno on the 21st was 0.79 inch; the old record rainfall had been 0.52 inch, set in 2010.||Lines of showers with a few embedded thunderstorms moved through the central California interior during the early morning hours of January 21st. These lines of convective activity brought locally heavy rain, gusty winds and a few lightning strikes. Scattered thunderstorms continued through the day, producing pea-size hail and a funnel cloud. Tree limbs were blown down by the winds, with downed limbs reported near Lake Isabella and in Yosemite National Park. One large tree limb in the Park fell on a tent cabin, resulting in the death of the occupant.||The third, and final, trough reached central California on the 23rd. This system also brought thunderstorms with small hail. A funnel cloud also was observed. In the Southern Sierra Nevada, snowfall totals from the three storms reached 1�� feet in the high country.||An upper-level ridge built into California behind the departing storm. With abundant ground moisture, the stable airmass allowed the lower layers of the atmosphere to cool to saturation. Consequently, areas of dense fog developed the central and southern San Joaquin Valley. The next few nights saw less fog, mainly confined to west of Highway 99. Clouds over the region during the night of January 26th-27th kept the San Joaquin Valley mostly fog free. However, an upper-level short-wave passing through California did produce areas of drizzle on the Valley floor. The clouds also kept low temperatures in the central and southern San Joaquin Valley unseasonably warm. Both Bakersfield and Fresno bottomed out in the lower 50s and tied their record high minimum temperatures for the 27th (51 and 52 degrees, respectively).||Low clouds persisted over the San Joaquin Valley through much of the day on the 27th, and redeveloped over much of the Valley overnight. Areas of dense fog formed around sunrise, mainly in Kern and Merced Counties, and persisted through late morning. Dense fog redeveloped over San Joaquin Valley again during the early morning of January 29th, and persisted through late morning; a few fog patches lingered into the early afternoon hours.||Mid and high clouds moved into California on the 29th ahead of an upper-level trough that weakened the persistent ridge. Due to the clouds, fog development during the morning of January 30th was patchy, with some areas not seeing fog until around sunrise.||An upper-level disturbance approached the central California coast on January 30th, and moved inland during the afternoon. The disturbance had enough dynamics to trigger isolated light rain showers over the central California interior. The showers brought measurable rain to a few locations, including Fresno and NAS Lemoore, and lingered past midnight into the early morning hours of January 31st.||Bakersfield tied for its 10th warmest January on record, and Fresno had its 16th warmest January on record. For the rain season to date, the central and southern San Joaquin Valley had only received between a third and a half of normal.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A thunderstorm with heavy rain and lightning moved across Yosemite Valley on the morning of the 21st during a strong winter storm. The thunderstorm briefly generated gusty winds estimated at 40 to 45 mph which caused a tree to fall on a tent. Inside the tent was a park service employee who was killed by the tree fall.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A little further to the south numerous large tree limbs and a few large trees were blown down along and west of Oak Hill Avenue and south of Grove Street.  Additional large tree branches and a few large trees fell on Florence Street between Forest Street and Oak Hill Avenue.  Most of the branches fell to the south and southwest showing a divergent wind damage pattern.  More tree and large limb damage occurred just northeast of the intersection of School Avenue and Forest Street near the grounds of Holy Cross Catholic Church.  Another microburst occurred at the intersection of West Washington and North Smith Street.  A grocery store lost much of its roof and was displaced into the parking lot south of the store.  A fatality occurred in the parking lot where debris from the roof shattered the front window of a car killing the 28 year old woman who was in the vehicle at the time.  A person in a nearby car sustained minor injuries from the flying debris as well.  Additional minor roof damage occurred at the Cuba post office where some of the roofing material was peeled off.  The length of the microburst damage path was approximately three quarters of a mile and about a third of a mile wide.  Based on the tree and structural damage, winds associated with the microbursts were estimated between 65 and 75 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A surface trough along the Texas-New Mexico border and a jet streak aloft provided the lift necessary for scattered thunderstorm development by 1400 CST. As these storms moved east across the South Plains through the late afternoon and evening, they coalesced into a squall line that developed occasional bowing structures. One of these bows struck western and northern portions of the city of Lubbock toppling a brick wall at the Lubbock Christian University's baseball field. These winds also lofted small gravel and stones that shattered the windows of approximately 20 cars at Texas Tech University and also broke the windows of a nearby bus stop booth. As these storms swept off the Caprock, their overall intensity diminished. An exception to this occurred in southwest Cottle County where a narrow corridor of fierce winds developed just south of a decaying mesoscale convective vortex. Winds at a Texas Tech University West Texas mesonet station located ten miles west-southwest of Paducah were clocked as high as 96 mph within this downburst. Farther north, a slow-moving supercell developed in western Briscoe County and drifted southeast directly over Caprock Canyons State Park accompanied by torrential rain rates of three inches per hour. These rains deluged the park and produced flash flooding along a normally dry creek that drains into Lake Theo. The creek became swollen with several feet of water and proceeded to inundate a bridge causing damage to the asphalt road. Frequent lightning from this day's storms also caused several small grassfires throughout the region, but none of these resulted in any known damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Downburst winds estimated around 70 mph overturned a tractor trailer and injured its driver while traveling southeast on U.S. Highway 84.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This derecho produced widespread, significant wind damage from southern New Jersey southward into the Delmarva during the late evening and overnight of the 29th.||Strong thunderstorm development began across the Midwest and Lower Great Lakes regions during the afternoon of the 29th, with storms initiating across northern Illinois, near Chicago. Strong mid-level winds and an unstable airmass contributed to rapid development as well-organized storms progressed from northern Illinois through Indiana and Ohio. This robust convection continued to track southeastward into an airmass that was even more unstable due to abundant daytime surface heating. Late afternoon temperatures had peaked mainly in the mid to upper 90s with high humidity throughout the Mid Atlantic states, and as the potent thunderstorm cluster progressed from the Great Lakes to the central Appalachians and into the Mid Atlantic by late evening, thunderstorm activity was reinvigorated.||A robust gust front outpaced the main thunderstorm line, producing strong wind gusts as it traveled from the eastern shore of Maryland into Delaware and southern New Jersey. Shortly thereafter, the potent thunderstorm line tracked through the region, with additional damaging wind gusts. One cell in particular around Baltimore, MD experienced rapid intensification and expansion as it raced eastward into northern Delaware and southern New Jersey. This massive cell produced extreme damage throughout Salem, Cumberland, and Atlantic counties in New Jersey. Damage to trees, power lines, and buildings was also significant throughout Delaware and the eastern shore of Maryland. Thunderstorms also dropped hail in several locations, ranging from penny to golf-ball size. Destructive wind gusts, between 65 mph to nearly 90 mph, were measured as this derecho tracked from the Lower Great Lakes to the Mid Atlantic coast.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A gust front outrunning a cluster of severe thunderstorms entered near Port Deposit in western Cecil County at approximately 11:27 pm EDT on the 29th. This gust front produced damaging wind gusts estimated from 65 to 70 mph as it traversed eastward across the county. Within approximately 20 minutes of the gust front passage, a potent line of severe thunderstorms tracked eastward into Cecil County. One thunderstorm cell in particular experienced rapid intensification and expansion as it tracked from around Baltimore, MD across Cecil County and into northern Delaware. Destructive wind gusts, estimated at 70 mph, resulted in significant tree and power line damage county-wide. Approximately 35 roads were impassable due to numerous downed trees. In Chesapeake City, several large trees fell onto homes, resulting in one injury. A tree also fell onto a house in the town of North East. Damage to multiple buildings was reported in Warwick, and a large concentration of downed trees was reported in Cecilton. Severe thunderstorms exited eastern Cecil County, including the town of Elkton, at approximately 12:40 am EDT on the 30th.  A young man was critically injured on the morning of July 2 around 330 am EDT when a tree branch fell on his tent at Camp Rodney in Elk Neck State Park in Northeast, Maryland.

The president ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in Atlantic, Cumberland and Salem counties. Federal funds will be available to state and local governments and certain nonprofit private organizations.  Atlantic City Electric reported 206,000 of its customers lost power; 105,000 of the homes and businesses were in Atlantic County.  On Sunday July 1st, 119,000 of its customers were still without power.  The utility restored power to its last customers on July 11th.  Meanwhile in Cumberland County, Vineland Electric expected its remaining 1,800 customers that lost power to have it restored during the week of July 9th.||Strong thunderstorm development began across the Midwest and Lower Great Lakes regions during the afternoon of the 29th, with storms initiating across northern Illinois, near Chicago.  Strong mid-level winds and an unstable airmass contributed to rapid development as well-organized storms progressed from northern Illinois through Indiana and Ohio.  This robust convection continued to track southeastward into an airmass that was even more unstable due to abundant daytime surface heating.  Late afternoon temperatures had peaked mainly in the mid to upper 90s with high humidity throughout the Mid Atlantic states, and as the potent thunderstorm cluster progressed from the Great Lakes to the central Appalachians and into the Mid Atlantic by late evening, thunderstorm activity was reinvigorated.  ||A robust gust front outpaced the main thunderstorm line, producing strong wind gusts as it traveled from the eastern shore of Maryland into Delaware and southern New Jersey. Shortly thereafter, the potent thunderstorm line tracked through the region, with additional damaging wind gusts. One cell in particular around Baltimore, MD experienced rapid intensification and expansion as it raced eastward into northern Delaware and southern New Jersey. This massive cell produced extreme damage throughout Salem, Cumberland, and Atlantic Counties in New Jersey. Damage to trees, power lines, and buildings was also significant throughout Delaware and the eastern shore of Maryland. Thunderstorms also dropped hail in several locations, ranging from penny to golf-ball size. Destructive wind gusts, between 65 mph to nearly 90 mph, were measured as this derecho tracked from the Lower Great Lakes to the Mid Atlantic coast.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A gust front outrunning a cluster of severe thunderstorms entered near Pennsville in western Salem County at approximately 12:19 am EDT on the 30th. This gust front produced damaging wind gusts estimated from 65 to 70 mph as it traversed eastward across the county. Within approximately 20 minutes of the gust front passage, a potent line of severe thunderstorms tracked eastward into Salem county. One thunderstorm cell in particular experienced rapid intensification and expansion as it tracked into southern New Jersey. Destructive wind gusts, estimated at 75 mph, resulted in significant tree and power line damage county-wide. Severe thunderstorms exited eastern Salem County, including the town of Elmer, at approximately 1:06 am EDT on the 30th. ||Widespread damage occurred across Salem County as a result of the strong wind gusts associated with the gust front and cluster of severe thunderstorms. One home was destroyed, another suffered major damage. Three other homes suffered minor damage and one other was also affected. Numerous large tree limbs blew down in the town of Elmer. The Little Acres Farm in Pittsgrove Township had about four dozen 80-foot trees completely uprooted. Approximately 70 trees were knocked down onto roadways across the county, resulting in numerous road closures. Several hundred large trees were knocked down or damaged in Parvin State Park (Pittsgrove Township) in eastern Salem County, and two fatalities resulted. Two young boys, ages 2 and 7, were killed when the top half of a 40 to 50 foot pine tree snapped off due to high wind gusts and landed on the camping tent where they and other family members were taking shelter. The two boys were cousins, one from nearby Franklin Township (Gloucester County) and the other from Millville (Cumberland County). An intense cluster of thunderstorms tracked over eastern Salem County at 12:50 am EDT on the 30th, producing wind gusts estimated between 70 to 75 mph.  ||Thousands of customers lost power across the county as a result of extensive tree and wire damage, with many areas experiencing power outages for up to one week. Some customers did not have their power restored until after the 4th of July. As a result, Salem County Emergency Services and the American Red Cross established air-conditioned cooling centers in Woodstown and at the Pittsgrove Township Municipal Building as temperatures soared into the 90s during the week following the derecho.||Damage estimates for Parvin State Park alone are approximately $500,000 as several buildings were damaged and hundreds of trees were either knocked down or damaged. More than a month following the derecho, the majority of the park remained closed to the public as clean-up efforts continued. The swimming beach and concession stand at the park did not reopen until the weekend of July 21st - 22nd. Through early August 2012, some 938 trees have been removed from the park, and damaged large limbs from another 989 trees have been hauled away. Park officials anticipate that much of the park will remain closed to the public for months.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A squall line developed across southeast Arkansas and moved quickly across north-central Mississippi during the morning, producing multiple reports of damaging winds and ping-pong to golf ball size hail. There were reports of multiple trees blown down, some roofs blown off buildings and wind gusts of 60-80 mph, with a 77 mph wind gust measured at the Columbus AFB surface observing station. A lone supercell moved across southeast Arkansas just after 1:00 pm and showed many indications of very large hail and strong rotation. This storm gradually began making more of a right turn and continued to dive southeast across northeast Louisiana before moving into Mississippi. This storm produced multiple reports of golf ball to baseball size hail as it continued to dive southeast, shattering windows in homes and vehicles. This storm gradually weakened as another storm began to develop just to the southwest over Morehouse Parish. The storm continued to move southeast with the southern edge of the storm beginning to develop supercell characteristics. This storm became the focus of activity as it began rapidly increasing in intensity and showing signs of producing large hail. Ping pong to tennis ball size hail fell as the storm moved into northern Warren County, breaking numerous windows on vehicles near Redwood. Strong winds blew a tree on a house and caused a minor injury near Redwood. The long-lived supercell continued to move into a favorable environment and produced multiple reports of golf ball to baseball size hail along its path as it moved into the Jackson metro area. The largest hailstone was softball size, or 4.25 inches, which fell in Clinton around 3:50 pm, shattering vehicle windshields. One injury occurred in the Pinehaven community near Clinton when a baseball size hailstone fell onto a resident causing head trauma. This supercell continued to move southeast over the downtown Jackson metro area with numerous reports of golf ball to baseball size hail falling all along the path. The large hail from this supercell caused major roof damage, shattered windshields and caused dents in numerous vehicles and siding damage to multiple mobile homes in the Jackson metro area. The squall line in northeastern Mississippi produced an outflow boundary that moved to the south and southeast which would serve as a focus for additional thunderstorm development ahead of the storm moving into western Mississippi. Thunderstorms began increasing in intensity along the outflow boundary and numerous reports of large hail continued in a swath down into southern Mississippi. Reports of golf ball to baseball size hail were received along a line from Seminary to Natchez and a few golf ball size hailstones fell south of Columbia. As the actual cold front finally made its way through the I-20 corridor and south, additional hail fell during the evening. However, this hail was significantly smaller than what fell earlier, with sizes ranging from nickel to quarter size. The thunderstorms gradually moved out of the Pine Belt region late on the evening of the 18th.||An elementary school in Clinton was damaged bad enough to have to close for the remainder of the school year, and many state and local law enforcement vehicles were heavily damaged or totaled. The amount of damages to the Jackson metro area were staggering and will be remembered for years to come.

There were several rounds of convection.  The first developed over northern Iowa during the mid afternoon hours and moved north into Minnesota.  A break in the thunderstorm activity took place before the next round moved into southwest Iowa and spread north and east during the evening.  The atmosphere became unstable with highs in the 80s and dewpoints in the low to mid 60s by afternoon.  CAPE, though not excessive, was sufficient with 1000 to 3000 J/kg available.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 300 and 600 J/kg.  In the late afternoon hours around 500 J/kg of downdraft CAPE was present, and it increased to around 900 to 1100 J/kg during the evening hours. The shear increased as well with 25 to 40 kts available at the beginning of the event, and 50 to 60 kts by the end.  Precipitable water values increased to 1.2 to 1.5 inches.  The LCL was relatively low, around 1000 meters.  The freezing level was relatively low, around 11,900 feet.  The storms produced heavy rain and large hail initially.  Flash flooding occurred first in Crawford County in western Iowa with over two inches of rainfall in about an hour, causing water to flow over Highway 141.  The event became a wind and hail event for the most part with winds gusting to 60 to 80 MPH across a large part of the CWA and hail up to 3 inches in diameter in Adams County.  The largest hail was northwest of Carbon in Adams County, where 2 to 3 inch diameter hail fell.  Reports indicated enough hail fell to completely cover the ground. Numerous reports of 1.5 inch hail were received.  Three tornadoes touched down in central Iowa. Numerous reports of winds of 60 to 80 MPH were received all along the line of thunderstorms.  High winds blew a semi truck off the highway and blew it over west of Earlham in Madison County.

This complex encountered a very unstable air mass near a weak surface trough over Northern and Eastern Oklahoma and Northern Arkansas as it continued southeastward. At the same time, other scattered showers and thunderstorms developed over Central and Eastern Arkansas near this surface trough, while also aided by a weak upper level disturbance sinking south across Arkansas and the Mid-Mississippi Valley. The Eastern Oklahoma storm complex absorbed the growing storm complex over Central Arkansas, resulting in a large mesoscale convective system (MCS) intensifying and surging south into Southeast Oklahoma and Southwest Arkansas during the mid and late afternoon hours. Widespread wind damage was reported across much of Central and Southern Arkansas as well as Southeast Oklahoma, with a large cold pool of air surging south into Northeast Texas and North Louisiana by late afternoon and early evening. Wind gusts ranged from 50-70 mph with this MCS as it surged south across much of the Ark-La-Tex, resulting in numerous downed trees, power lines, and structural damage. This storm complex weakened during the early evening hours, although the resultant cold pool still produced 40-45 mph wind gusts which produced minor tree damage over portions of Deep East Texas that did not see showers or thunderstorms. Over 500,000 AEP SWEPCO customers were without power after the storms blew through, with many thousands of other customers with other utility companies also without power.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 64 year old female was walking in the 1900 block of Weinstock Street and was killed by a tree that fell on top of her.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The wave took on a strong negative tilt and moved into a moist and very unstable air mass. The outcome was a widespread severe weather event for Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho producing large hail, flash flooding, and widespread wind damage.

A navy bouy located on the south end of Lake Pend Oreille clocked a wind gust of 75 mph.  Multiple trees were knocked down across the city of Sandpoint and smaller communities surrounding Lake Pend Oreille.  Many roads were closed until trees and power lines were removed including Highway 95 near the intersection of McArthur Street.  Power was out for the entire city of Sandpoint and majority of Bonner County directly following the storm.  Several trees fell on houses.  Southern exposed bays on Lake Pend Oreille experienced the worst damage.  Over thirty trees were knocked down between Gamlin Lake and Garfield Bay.  Two people were injured by a falling tree at Green Bay.  Further north on the lake, roughly twenty trees were downed in Shaw Bay.  On a ridge, known as Hawkins Point, over fifty trees were snapped four feet from the ground.  The winds created three to six foot waves in sections of the lake resulting in dock and boat damage.

Plenty of instability and moisture was available for the line to mature into a severe bow-echo with the bulk of this racing northwest of the area into Wisconsin and Central Lower Michigan. The southern flank of this line did briefly take on bowing characteristics, producing gusty winds over southern Lake Michigan into portions of northwestern Indiana and far southwestern Lower Michigan before dissipating. Behind this line, a much stronger line of thunderstorms rapidly developed on a pre-frontal trough in northern Illinois. This line had much more favorable parameters to work with deep layer shear to 50 knots and a rapidly increasing low level jet to 50 knots. As this second line of convection raced into northwestern Indiana during the late evening hours, several stronger circulations were noted along the leading edge that lead to multiple tornado confirmations and swaths of at times extensive wind damage.

The southern flank of this line did briefly take on bowing characteristics, producing gusty winds over southern Lake Michigan into portions of northwestern Indiana and far southwestern Lower Michigan before dissipating. Behind this line, a much stronger line of thunderstorms rapidly developed on a pre-frontal trough in northern Illinois. This line had much more favorable parameters to work with deep layer shear to 50 knots and a rapidly increasing low level jet to 50 knots. As this second line of convection raced into northwestern Indiana during the late evening hours, several stronger circulations were noted along the leading edge that lead to multiple tornado confirmations and swaths of at times extensive wind damage.

Isolated thunderstorms occurred through the afternoon over the Sandhills, generally dissipating as they moved southeast into South Central Nebraska. However, by late afternoon thunderstorms intensified with supercells and high-end multicells becoming dominant. The most intense storm of this event produced a prolific swath of significant severe weather. This storm formed over Loup County around 4 p.m. CDT and subsequently tracked south-southeastward through Valley, Sherman, eastern Buffalo, Adams and Webster counties. By 9 p.m. CDT, the storm finally reached the Nebraska-Kansas border. It was responsible for producing hail up to the size of golf balls and winds of 60 to 90 MPH. Hail turned the ground white from Loup City to Ravenna to Gibbon. Combined with the severe winds, tremendous damage occurred to many homes with vinyl siding in these areas. Windows were even broken. The hail and wind caused severe crop damage as well, stripping the corn of its leaves and leaving little but shredded stalks. The scar from damaged crops remained visible, in even relatively low-resolution GOES satellite imagery, the rest of the summer. A semi-tractor trailer was blown on its side on Interstate 80, just southeast of Kearney. Winds were measured as high as 85 MPH in the town of Norman. Other storms became severe over the Sandhills and affected other portions of Valley, Greeley, Howard and Sherman counties during the early to mid-evening hours. These storms also produce hail up to the size of golf balls. Scattered thunderstorms continued to develop into the late evening and even the overnight hours from Broken Bow southward to Beaver City. Winds were estimated between 60 and 70 MPH with some of these storms, along with hail up to the size of ping pong balls.||These storms all developed in an upslope flow regime, north of a quasi-stationary front, with high pressure over the Midwest. The front extended from northwest to southeast across Nebraska and bisected South Central Nebraska, separating temperatures in the 80s to near 90 from rain cooled air in the 60s and 70s, during the late afternoon hours. Aloft, subtropical high pressure was over New Mexico with a low amplitude ridge over the Rockies and a trough over the eastern United States. These storms formed on the eastern fringe of the instability gradient. Poor mid-level lapse rates and cool surface temperatures, resulting in innocuous MLCAPE of 500 to 1500 J/kg. Deep layer shear was between 40 and 50 knots.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Strong outflow from the parent thunderstorm located to the east of this path produced wind gusts estimated to be near 70 MPH. There were numerous reports of tree damage in the area, including a large tree limb estimated to be 12 inches in diameter downed and a tree estimated to be 30 inches in diameter snapped at the base and then fell onto a home.  The elderly resident of this home suffered injuries when shards of glass entered the home from the combination of wind and hail. The top of a grain bin was blown off and vinyl siding was partially torn off one side of a home.  On Interstate 80, near exit 279 southeast of Kearney, a semi truck was blown onto its side.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This MCV then became a derecho Monday evening as it moved and bowed east through eastern North Dakota and the northern Minnesota and northern Wisconsin late Monday and early Tuesday (July 22nd).  This derecho caused widespread wind damage from winds of at least 50 to 70 mph over much of northeast Minnesota, blowing and/or snapping trees and knocking out power.

Numerous roads were blocked by fallen trees. Amtrak suspended its Keystone Line between Philadelphia and Harrisburg because of downed trees. In southeast Pennsylvania, SEPTA Regional Commuter Rail Service had to suspend service along Paoli-Thorndale, Fox Chase, Airport and Chestnut Hill Lines because of tree and line problems. Some SEPTA Trolly service was also suspended in Delaware County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A severe thunderstorm tore down several trees in Robeson Township.

A low pressure system was located in north central South Dakota by Monday evening, and its stationary front extended to the northeast through eastern North Dakota and Northwest Wisconsin.  Temperatures were in the middle 80s to low 90s in the warm sector, and the combination of dew point temperatures in the upper 60s to middle 70s resulted in heat indices in the 90s to 100s.  Thunderstorms developed during the late afternoon and early evening in western North Dakota and formed a mesoscale convective complex.  This MCV then became a derecho Monday evening as it moved and bowed east through eastern North Dakota and the northern Minnesota and northern Wisconsin late Monday and early Tuesday (July 22nd).  This derecho caused widespread wind damage from winds of at least 50 to 70 mph over much of northeast Minnesota, blowing and/or snapping trees and knocking out power.  There were more focused areas of structural damage that suggested there were winds in excess of 70 mph.  There were several injuries to campers in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness due to falling trees, which required officials to make some rescues.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Two campers were injured from a tree falling on their campsite on Loon Lake.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The wave took on a strong negative tilt and moved into a moist and very unstable air mass.  The outcome was a widespread severe weather event for Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho producing large hail, flash flooding, and widespread wind damage.  Large hail and heavy rain were the initial threats early in the afternoon.  Late in the afternoon, the threat shifted to damaging winds with hundreds of downed or snapped trees.  The hardest hit areas were Northeastern Washington and Northern Idaho.  Falling trees led to some injuries in Eastern Washington.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A wet microburst brought sustained winds of 35 to 50 mph with gusts 60 to 70 mph across Spokane County.  The winds descended near Cheney and peaked while passing through Airway Heights, Northwestern Spokane, and Deer Park.  Hundreds of Ponderosa Pines were snapped and downed from Northwestern Spokane to Deer Park.  Downed trees led to widespread structural damage, blocked roads, power outages, and injuries.  Significant damage was observed at the Riverside Village Mobile Home Park from trees falling on mobile homes prompting a search and rescue.  One woman was trapped but was not injured.  At least 40 mobile homes and cars in the park were severely damaged.  Forty eight trees were knocked down at a resort on Lake Eloika.  Trees fell on six RVs and the resort's oldest cabin forcing the owners to close their doors for a short period of time.  One person was injured when a tree landed on his vehicle while driving along Lakeside Dr near Reflection Lake in Elk, WA.  A tree branch flew through his windshield and drove him off the road severing his arm and impaling his hip.  He eventually lost his arm in the accident.  Three other people were injured near the Spokane Courthouse by falling tree branches.  Over 30,000 people lost power during the event.  Because of the extent of damage, some residents and businesses remained in the dark for up to four days.  Downed power poles and lightning strikes sparked several new wildfires which quickly grew due to the strong winds.  The winds completely damaged a airport hanger and caused between ten to twelve thousand dollars worth of damage to planes.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A couple of discrete supercells developed in northeast Mississippi ahead of a squall line and tracked across northwest Alabama.

This outbreak started across the Central Plains on the 27th and slowly migrated eastward over the following two days. A large tornado outbreak occurred across the Lower MS River & TN River Valleys on the 28th. The event was capped on the 30th with additional severe weather and a historic flash flooding/heavy rain event along the AL, FL gulf coast where rainfall totals peaked between 15-25 inches!||Across the NWS Jackson, MS forecast area, the tornado outbreak on the 28th was the main event. This event was driven by a classic severe weather pattern with a strong fast moving jet stream and a deep surface cyclone over the central plains. These features helped to produce strong wind shear in the atmosphere which in turn combined with rich gulf moisture and setup a volatile atmospheric mix. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed during the afternoon/evening and produced many instances of damaging wind and large hail along with multiple tornadoes. The most devastating tornado was the EF-4 which tore a path across NE Leake, the corners of Attala/Neshoba counties, and through the heart of Winston County where the city of Louisville was especially hard hit. This tornado was on ground for 34.3 miles and resulted in 10 fatalities and many injuries. Other hard hit counties were Lowndes, Rankin, Hinds, Scott, Newton, Montgomery, Warren and Jones. Each of these counties experienced at least one tornado, some multiple tornadoes. Overall, 21 tornadoes were confirmed across the forecast area. Of these tornadoes, 3 were rated EF-3, 3 rated EF-2, 12 rated EF1 and 2 rated EF-0.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Several trees were blown down in the area.
