They had just come ashore and were securing their boat as the storm hit.  Both men, ages 35 and 21, were knocked on their back by the bolt and were momentarily paralyzed.  There were holes in their clothing where the electricity passed through.  They both had reddish streaks resembling sunburn stretching from their left armpit to their right leg.  They were treated for 2nd degree burns at a local hospital.  One of the victims had been struck by lightning once before in 8th grade while camping.  In Anne Arundel County, numerous trees were downed by high wind.  Poplar trees were downed by Annapolis Mall and power outages were reported.  A wind gust of 60 MPH was estimated in Annapolis where pea sized hail fell.  A wind gust of 45 MPH was reported in Rivera Beach where pea sized hail was also spotted.

A complex weather situation was in place due to the convection from the previous night.  An outflow boundary extended east to west across northern Missouri.  The synoptic frontal boundary extended from central Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The air was clear over Iowa during the day, allowing for temperatures to recover.  Dew point values also recovered quite rapidly with readings in the upper 60s to low 70s by the late afternoon hours.  Lifted indices dropped into the -5 to -10 C. range by evening with CAPE values approaching 5000 J/kg.  By the evening hours, the frontal boundary and outflow boundary had converged and were located along Interstate 80.  Explosive thunderstorm development took place during the very late afternoon and evening hours in spite of the weak shear profile.  Discrete supercells formed in a narrow line along Interstate 80 from near Des Moines on west.  The storms became tornadic quickly.  To add insult to injury, a strong thunderstorm complex formed over Nebraska and moved east along the line of convection over Iowa.  As the event took shape, all modes of severe weather occurred.  The storms developed so rapidly that there was little more than a half hour from the first hail and wind report to the first tornado touchdown.  Hail and high wind reports were too numerous to mention individually here.  Numerous reports of golf ball size hail were received.  Boone and Story Counties reported some of the largest hail with the event as baseball size hail pelted the are.  There was one report of very large hail northwest of Slater in Story County.  Hail five and one half inches in diameter punched 8 holes through a steel roof.  There was severe house siding and roof damage in the area.  There were numerous tornadoes, especially in the central Iowa Iowa.  At one point there were several supercells around the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Two of the stronger tornadoes touched down west and south of Des Moines.  Fortunately, most of the tornado tracks were over open areas and resulted in little damage.  High winds became a problem, especially after sunset, as the complex from Nebraska moved in.  The system became more of a derecho during the late night hours.  Eighty plus MPH winds pelted southwest Iowa and downed barns and several buildings in Adams and Cass Counties.  A beta bow element formed in central Iowa shortly before midnight.  The bow echo produced a measured wind gust of 106 MPH in northern Warren County.  The high winds continued to push east along Interstate 80 for the next hour or so before it started to weaken.  The other major problem was with heavy rain.  The convection from the previous night set the stage by saturating soils.  The echos trained for several hours across central Iowa with very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall rates of 4 to 5 inches per hour were common under the heavier cells.  Several locations received 2 to 5 inch rainfalls in under  two hours, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  Reports of major highways being inundated by water were common.  By the end of the night, a swath of 4 to 9 inch rainfall was evident north of Interstate 80.  Longer term river flooding became a major problem by the morning of the 23rd.  There were two lightning related injuries.  Two people were injured when they were struck by lightning out of doors in Nevada.  The lightning struck close by as they were carrying groceries into their home.  The jolt caused them to fall, resulting in laceration to the head.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This warm front began the day nearly stationary, taking 8 hours to move from Vincennes to Bloomington, then rocketing northward as the low pressure system quickly pushed off to the northeast late, dragging a cold front through the state during the overnight hours. All the necessary ingredients for a major severe weather outbreak were falling into place.  Morning upper-air observations showed very deep moisture and intense wind shear (wind change in speed and direction with respect to height) in the lower levels of the atmosphere.  Fairly clear skies during the course of the day contributed to moderately strong instability across much of Indiana.  Along and north of the warm front, winds backed to the east-southeast, further enhancing the wind shear.  This area of enhanced shear with the deep moisture and instability pooled along it would serve as the focus for the first two rounds of severe weather in the Indianapolis County Warning Area (CWA) on May 30th.The first wave of severe weather came in the early afternoon, as individual rotating thunderstorms, or supercells, formed just south of the warm front, crossing over the boundary soon after forming and moving into the area of enhanced shear.  These supercells began to show strong rotation soon after their formation, and produced several funnel reports and confirmed tornadoes near Spencer and Ellettsville.  Each of these tornadoes were rated F1 on the Fujita Scale of Tornado Intensity, a rating corresponding to the partial peeling of roofs and destruction of small outbuildings.Wave number two began in the late afternoon and continued into the early evening hours. Additional supercell development occurred further west along the warm front, in an area that had been receiving plenty of heating all day, maximizing instability in the very moist air mass. This wave of storms included a storm that produced tornadoes in Fountain and Tippecanoe counties, one of which was rated F2 near Dayton, just southeast of Lafayette, and a long-lived supercell that tracked along and just south of the I-70 corridor, producing tornadoes in Brazil, Little Point, Monrovia, just south of Plainfield, Camby, and Indianapolis.  Power flashes from the Camby tornado were visible from the front door of NWS Indianapolis.  The strongest of these tornadoes was the Indianapolis tornado, which briefly achieved F2 strength on the southeast side near Keystone Avenue between Raymond and Troy where there was significant damage to numerous homes, a nursing home and an elementary school. 26 nursing home inhabitants were treated at local hospitals for minor injuries, and the rest were relocated as the building was inhabitable. In addition to this tornado, the Monrovia tornado was rated F1.  All additional tornadoes from this particular supercell were rated F0, a rating corresponding to moderate tree damage and damage to outbuildings and signboards. There was also a lightning fatality in Veedersburg in Fountain County as a 24 year old male was struck while on a baseball field.The final wave of severe weather came in the late evening and early nighttime hours, and was mostly in the form of wind damage, although brief tornadoes did occur along the squall line that had formed near the Mississippi River and tracked eastward, accompanying the passage of the cold front, including tornadoes near Lake Monroe and Crothersville in south central Indiana, and Atlanta and Frankton in north central Indiana.  The tornado near Lake Monroe was rated F1, while all additional tornadoes were rated F0.To complicate the issue, the repeated rounds of heavy rain caused flooding problems across much of the area, with several flash flood warnings and urban/small stream flood advisories being issued during the evening and overnight hours.Fifteen total tornadoes touched down in central Indiana on May 30th, with damage estimates approaching $13,000,000 for central Indiana alone. In all, an additional eight tornadoes touched down in portions of Indiana that are served by neighboring NWS forecast offices, bringing the statewide total for the day to 23, four over the yearly average of 19.  This places the May 30th outbreak as the second largest outbreak in state history, behind the outbreak of 2 June 1990, and ahead of the "Super Outbreak" of 3-4 April 1974.  37 tornadoes touched down statewide in the 1990 outbreak, and 21 tornadoes touched down during the Super Outbreak, which was the largest outbreak of tornadoes in recorded history, with 148 tornadoes touching down across 13 states and southern Canada, killing 351 and injuring thousands.  Nationwide, several more tornadoes were reported, along with nearly 200 reports of large hail and nearly 600 reports of wind damage.  Reports occurred all along the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, stretching from central Minnesota all the way to northeast Texas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 24 year old male was hit by lightning on a baseball field and died shortly thereafter.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Intense thunderstorms fired along and ahead of a cold front working down from the northern Great Lakes and eventually developed into a large MCS by mid evening. The Tri Cities and thumb regions were especially hard hit during this event. Several microbursts actually produced 100 MPH wind gusts across northeast Huron county, causing quite a bit of damage. The outflow created from the storms across the north actually held together long enough to spread south. There were several reports of trees blown down in areas south of M-59, although the damage was minimal when compared to the destruction across the northern parts of the area. Very few reports of hail were received, however, golf ball size hail was reported in Saginaw County. This event caused one death and one injury in Wayne County.

These storms developed well ahead of a cold front that extended from southern and eastern Oklahoma, into central Arkansas, but mainly along a differential moisture boundary that moved south across east Texas, extreme southern Arkansas, and north Louisiana. Strong surface instability, and gust fronts that developed from these storms, focused new shower and thunderstorm development, with several of these storms becoming severe. One longer lived severe thunderstorm developed over eastern Upshur County, then merged with another southward moving band of strong thunderstorms, producing widespread wind damage across eastern Upshur, much of Gregg, and northern Rusk County. The cities of Longview and Kilgore were hit hardest, with numerous trees blown down/uprooted, power lines downed, and trees falling onto homes, with at least one known injury reported. A 53-yr old man was killed on the north side of Longview when lightning struck a tree he was standing near in wake of the storm.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 53 year old man was struck and killed by lightning on Cox Lane.

The system came through as a bowling ball type event as the upper low first became negatively tilted, then closed off over Iowa.  Low pressure moved across Kansas into northern Missouri, then turned northeast across central into northeast Iowa as it intensified.  The low dropped to about 978 mb as it moved through Iowa.  The low brought a variety of weather to the state, with a blizzard over much of the west half of the state, and thunderstorms with pea to marble size hail over the east half.  As the low passed to the east cold air and high winds overspread the state.  Sustained winds of 30 to 40 MPH were widespread, with occasional gusts to between 50 to 60 MPH were common.  Visibility in rural areas dropped to zero, remaining that way for an extended period of time.  Heavy snowfall occurred over the western part of Iowa with snowfall rates approaching 4 inches per hour at times as the snow was convective in nature.  A large area of Iowa northwest of a a Creston to Mason City line received in excess of 10 inches of snow.  Some of the heavier totals include 18 inches at Estherville, 17 inches at Carroll, 16.8 inches in Estherville, 15.5. inches in Ringsted, and 14 inches in Pocahontas, Atlantic, and Goldfield.  The combination of high winds, heavy snowfall, and the preexisting snow on the ground resulted in roads drifting shut quite rapidly.  Widespread blizzard conditions resulted in numerous road closures over the northwest half of the state.  Interstate 80 was closed westbound at Iowa City to the Nebraska border, and both east and westbound at Des Moines.  Interstate 35 was close both north and southbound at Ankeny to the Minnesota border.  Hundreds of people were stranded in their cars during the height of the blizzard.  The National Guard was called out to conduct numerous SAR missions.  Reports of 5 to 10 foot snow drifts were common across western and northern Iowa, with drifts of 16 feet reported in the Carroll area.  The high winds and wet snow caused additional power outages over parts of the state as well.  An additional 30,000 people lost power during the storm.  Governor Chet Culver declared the remaining 39 counties of the state disaster areas, bringing all 99 counties under disaster declaration.  In addition, a request was made to place 44 Iowa Counties into Federal Disaster Status.  The request was granted, along with two additional counties.  A total of 46 counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration.  The blizzard was considered the worst blizzard in decades for parts of western Iowa.  In Carroll for example, the blizzard was the worst since the blizzard of 1947.  During the storm in Des Moines, thunderstorms moved across the city.  A woman was struck by lightning outside of Lovejoy Elementary School in Des Moines.  She received minor injuries and reported pain in her arm following the strike.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Low pressure approached from the west, along with a cold front so that the triple point was near the western Iowa, eastern Nebraska area by late afternoon.  Thunderstorms erupted quickly during the late afternoon and evening hours in the unstable airmass.  By evening, the low level jet was in the 40 to 60 kt range, feeding moisture into the state and pushing precipitable water values to around 200% of normal, in the 1.5 to 1.8 inch range.  MUCAPE reached 3000 to 3500 J/kg over western Iowa, with lifted indices in the -6 to -10 C. range.  The freezing level was quite high, limiting the hail size somewhat with this event, at 14,300 feet.  The available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was in the 300 to 500 J/kg range.  The DCAPE was between 800 and 1000 J/kg.  The environment was highly sheared with 50 to 65 kts of shear available during the event.  The LCL was also quite low, in the 750 to 1250 meter range.  Thunderstorms erupted over western Iowa stretching into north central Iowa first.  It did not take long for the storms to become severe with hail and high winds.  Most of the hail reported was in the pea to marble size, with the larger stones in the nickel to quarter size range.  The primary mode of severe weather was high winds and several tornadoes.  The secondary, but significant threat, was heavy rainfall.  A band of 3 to 5 inches of rain fell between U.S. Highway 30 and U.S. Highway 20 during the event.  The heaviest rainfall total was in Greene County at Jefferson, with 5.90 inches.  Tornadoes began to touch down in western Iowa in Crawford County with two brief touchdowns.  One was west of Dow City, causing roof and shingle damage to a farmhouse there.  The next was east of Denison where a barn roof was removed and a trailer house was destroyed.  A tornado in Carroll County caused damage to 3 farmsteads southeast of Templeton.  A machine shed was completely destroyed and numerous other buildings sustained damage.  Trees also had substantial damage. Two tornadoes touched down in Calhoun County.  One near Farnhamville, tore the roof off of a home and downed power lines.  The second caused damage to trees, outbuildings, and power lines on four farmsteads.  Farther south, a brief touchdown was reported in Dallas County in open fields west of Minburn.  Another tornado touched down in Dallas County later on, west of Adel, and was on the ground for about 4 miles.  A more substantial tornado touched down near Murray in Clarke County with one reported on the ground for about 9 miles.  As the storms moved east, another tornado was on the ground for over 10 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The most significant tornado occurred in Marion and Mahaska Counties where an EF2 tornado was on the ground for about 18 miles.  Several homes were damaged along its path, two mobile homes were destroyed, and considerable damage was done to trees in the area.  Up to 10 people were injured with this tornado, mainly in Attica.  The official damage count from this tornado included 5 homes destroyed, 15 with major damage, and another 25 with minor damage.  Many of the storms produced high winds with several reports of winds in the 65 to 75 MPH range.  Considerable tree damage was reported and some structural damage, mainly outbuildings and shingle damage.  Two cars were blown off of the road east of Manning by the high winds.  Building debris was blown onto Highway D60 near Gowrie, causing a brief closure.  High winds in Butler County blew down a machine shed and barn southwest of Aplington, very near to where an EF5 tornado struck just days before.  Extensive damage was done to a farmstead there with some damage done to the house itself as well.  Lightning struck a man in Carroll.  The lightning bolt hit his driveway, blowing out a chunk of concrete out of the driveway and also injured the man.  He was taken to hospital, treated, and released with minor injuries.  Flooding became a significant issue after the heavy rainfall of the previous few days.  Extensive river flooding occurred across the central third of the state.  Record crests were recorded on the Iowa River at Marshalltown.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

CAPE increased to over 3000 J/kg as the lifted index fell to around -7.  A strong low level jet of 50 to 60 kts was in place over the state.  Thunderstorms formed initially over Kansas, then spread northeast into western Iowa.  A wind gust of 65 MPH occurred in Bedford as the storms passed.  Mainly, the storms produced very heavy rainfall. In Taylor County, an inch of rain fell in 30 minutes at Gravity.  For the most part, the storms produced wind gusts of 30 to 45 MPH and pea to marble size hail.  Flash flooding occurred in Crawford County as heavy rains caused the water to rise over the top of U.S. Highway 30.  Rainfall of nearly 2 inches in less than an hour caused flash flooding in Bedford.  Lightning struck a 20 year old male that was working with his father in their yard, killing him.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Then the cold front moved through providing a lifting mechanism for showers and thunderstorms to develop.  High levels of moisture contributed to heavy downpours that resulted in flash flooding in Rhode Island and portions of Massachusetts.  All of this coupled with strong wind shear (turning of the winds with height) over southeast Massachusetts and Rhode Island provided the perfect environment for a tornado to form.  ||This particular tornado began as a waterspout over Narragansett Bay and traveled east-northeast reaching land over the southern portion of Warren, Rhode Island.  The tornado continued for 4.2 miles into Swansea, Massachusetts over a mostly continuous track.  Most of the damage sustained was to trees which fell on power lines and houses.  This tornado was rated by a National Weather Service damage survey team as an EF1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Lightning struck a delivery truck driver, injuring him, at the Stop and Shop.

Exceptional updrafts evident within these storms and high reflectivities through a deep layer within the thunderstorms (70 dbz to nearly 50,000 ft)produced hail up to the size of softballs at several locations across the county warning area.  The stones caused the most damage on the southwest side of the city of Manhattan, where the airport, numerous businesses, and hundreds of vehicles were pummeled with the large stones. Residents noted that it was so dark under the storms, that they needed a flashlight to see. A newspaper interview noted that one resident reported that gravel was shooting ten feet in the air, driven by the large hail. Farm fields across portions of Franklin County also showed extensive damage. Small animals that were unable to seek shelter also fell victim to the hail stones.  One Manhattan resident reported dead rabbits, squirrels, owls, and quail in his neighborhood. ||The somewhat discrete storms congealed into a convective line as they pushed southeastward across the county warning area, and the primary severe weather threat became strong winds. Residents and law enforcement officers across portions of Douglas, Franklin, Anderson, and Jefferson Counties reported wind gusts in the 60 to 70 mile per hour range. Two individuals in Shawnee County measured wind gusts of 80 miles per hour. Power outages were reported across the city of Topeka, with some residents left without power through that evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A woman went out for a walk just before ten in the morning , right after the rain associated with severe thunderstorm ended.  She stopped in her yard to pick a weed. Meanwhile, a lightning bolt struck the house across the street, and was felt by her. The bolt left a hole in the roof of the home, and blew several shingles onto the ground.  The woman had an elevated blood pressure, and was taken to a local hospital.  She was sore for several days after the strike.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was pushing an equally unusually strong cold front for early August into the southeast U.S.  This front combined with a very warm humid air mass, partially a result of the lingering remnants of Hurricane Dolly, to result in the development of numerous strong to severe thunderstorms in far north Georgia during the mid to late afternoon hours.  Thunderstorms across north Georgia merged into a near solid arched band of thunderstorms which raced southward during the evening hours into the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Large hail and intense cloud-to-ground lightning accompanied the thunderstorms in north Georgia.  Leading outflow winds produced a wind gust of 71 mph at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport as the thunderstorms came through around 730 pm EDT.  The thunderstorms subsequently diminished as they pushed further south of the Atlanta area, but redeveloped once again into strong to severe thunderstorms during the late evening as the outflow boundary pushed into the Macon area and nearby counties.  Numerous reports of downed trees were received from many north and central Georgia counties as a result of these thunderstorms.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Cherokee County Emergency Management Director reported that an individual was struck by lightning seven miles southwest of Canton and sustained non life-threatening injuries.

High levels of moisture contributed to heavy downpours that resulted in flash flooding in Rhode Island and portions of Massachusetts.  All of this coupled with strong wind shear (turning of the winds with height) over southeast Massachusetts and Rhode Island provided the perfect environment for a tornado to form.  ||This particular tornado began as a waterspout over Narragansett Bay and traveled east-northeast reaching land over the southern portion of Warren, Rhode Island.  The tornado continued for 4.2 miles into Swansea, Massachusetts over a mostly continuous track.  Most of the damage sustained was to trees which fell on power lines and houses.

A strong push of warm air took place ahead of the low with 850 mb winds around 40 kts pushing into the central U.S.  Surface dew points rose to the mid 50s just south of Iowa during the afternoon with the 50 degree dew points reaching just north of the southern Iowa border.  At the same time, a strong polar high pressure area was poised over northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  Sub-zero temperatures reached as far south as the northern South Dakota border during the afternoon.  The atmosphere was marginally unstable with most unstable, elevated, CAPE values in the 500 to 1000 J/kg range in the afternoon.  Shear increased to between 30 and 45 kts with precipitable water values in the three quarters to one inch range over the southeast half of the state.  Thunderstorms in some form occurred through the day.  Over northern Iowa, they produced ice pellets and some small hail.  One half of an inch of ice pellet accumulation occurred in Emmet and Cerro Gordo Counties, with nearly an inch of ice pellet accumulation in Worth County.  These accumulations were the result of thunderstorms.  Thunderstorms were more intense over southeast Iowa.  The freezing level was relatively low, at 8200 feet, resulting in most of the storms producing hail of at least pea size.  Available CAPE was around 200 J/kg at the time.  Penny to quarter size hail fell in central Iowa, across the Des Moines metro area.  Lightning struck an overpass along Interstate 80/35 along the north side of the Des Moines metro area and knocked a chunk of concrete off of it.  The concrete fell onto the windshield of a moving van, smashing through the glass.  The driver was injured and admitted to the hospital with minor injuries.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An unseasonably warm and unstable air mass developed in advance of the cold front during the late afternoon and early evening across north and central Georgia as warm, moist air rode northward into Georgia on a strong low-level jet.  Afternoon temperatures in the 70s and dewpoints in the 60s, combined with strong shear and moderate instability, resulted in the development of numerous supercell thunderstorms from mid-afternoon until a few hours after midnight on the 19th.  Ten tornadoes, ranging in scale from EF0 to EF3 tracked across several north and central Georgia counties.  The worst tornadoes affected the east central Georgia counties of Jasper, Putnam, Hancock, and Jasper.  A death was observed in Hancock county with an EF3 tornado and several injuries were reported from Putnam and Hancock counties.  In addition to the tornadoes, very large hail occurred with several of the thunderstorms, including four-inch diameter hail in Coweta and Fayette counties just south of Atlanta.  Numerous reports of golf ball and larger-sized hail were received.

This vortex, or more likely other vorticies associated with the same cell then meandered south along the beach and near-shore Atlantic waters for about ten minutes (about 3 minutes over or near the beach). Early in the evening, another tornado (rated EF0) developed inland over Port Orange and damaged over 150 manufactured/mobile homes before lifting.

The hail, ranging from golfball to baseball size, hit northeast Denver, Brighton and Commerce City the hardest.  The storms then continued to spread to the north and east; impacting Hudson, Prospect Valley, Byers and Deer Trail.   The strong thunderstorm wind and hail stripped bark and branches from trees.  Numerous accidents were reported as the hail accumulated up to a foot in depth on roadways.  Homes and vehicles in the area were pummeled by hail.   The Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Associated estimated to damage to be around $70 million; based off approximately 13,600 automobile and homeowner claims.  A child in Commerce City was struck in the leg by lightning while watching televison.  A bison and the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge was struck and killed by blast of lightning.  Two tornadoes also touched down in open country; one near Denver International Airport and the other near Keenesburg.  ||The heavy rain and hail caused flash flooding to occur around the towns of Hudson and Keenseburg; forcing the closure of State Highway 52.  Extensive crop damage was reported across southern Weld County.  Approximately 1500 acres of sugar beets were damaged in the Prospect Valley and Windsor areas.  About 360 acres of sweet corn, cabbage and onions in the Hudson area were inundated with heavy rain and a torrent of hail.  In Windsor, a barn was demolished by intense thunderstorm winds.   The wind ripped the 40-ft by 40-ft structure of a garage and exterior corrugated roof and walls about 75 yards from its original foundation. Also, two cow shelters and 150 calf shelters were blown over.  Near Bellvue, several structures were knocked down and a 15-ft silo was blown across a field by damaging thunderstorm winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A child was struck in the leg by lightning while watching television.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The airmass became unstable in front of it with a considerable push of deep moisture.  Precipitable water values increased to 2 to 2.4 inches by afternoon.  CAPE increased to 2500 to 4000 J/kg as afternoon temperatures climbed into the mid to upper 80s, with dewpoint readings in the low to middle 70s.  The lifted index fell to -5 to -7 C.  The atmosphere was not strongly sheared with 25 to 35 kts of effective shear available.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 600 and 800 J/kg.  Downdraft CAPE was in the 1000-1400 J/kg range.  A squall line developed ahead of the cold front and became marginally severe.  Many of the storms produced small hail and gusty winds.  A few locations reported winds in excess of 60 MPH, with the the highest winds reported of 64 MPH in Carroll County in Templeton.  High winds from thunderstorms moving into Winnebago County downed trees in a city park in Buffalo Center.  Winds estimated near 80 MPH snapped the top off of a power pole in Buffalo Center and also caused considerable tree damage and out building damage in the area.  Heavy rainfall was an issue with the storms given the high precipitable water values.  Three inches of rain fell in 50 minutes southeast of Madrid in Boone County, with reports of around 4 inches for storm total in the Ames area.  In Emmet County, 2.65 inches of rain fell in a little over an hour in Ringsted.  Fortunately, it has been quite dry for the previous 10 days.  The rains did not cause flash flooding, but did result in some urban flooding.  A 15 year old girl was struck by lightning in Leon as the thunderstorms passed.  She was walking across a parking lot and lightning struck just as she reached for the door handle of her car.  She was taken to hospital and remained overnight, however there were no detectable injuries beyond memory loss of the event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 15 year old girl was struck by lightning.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

For the first time in approximately three weeks, isolated thunderstorms developed over the Sierra crest around Kings Canyon and points just to the north and east. The surge of monsoonal moisture continued through the end of the month, with the strongest thunderstorm activity on July 30th and the morning of the 31st. A few thunderstorms over the Southern Sierra Nevada had rain rates of an inch or more in an hour, and a severe thunderstorm moved over Edwards Air Force Base during the afternoon of the 30th. The warm nature of the monsoonal moisture kept central and southern San Joaquin Valley high temperatures around 100 degrees through July 30th. ||A line of thunderstorms moved through the central and southern San Joaquin Valley during the morning of July 31st, bringing record-tying rain to both Bakersfield and Fresno. After the thunderstorms moved out of the San Joaquin Valley, skies began to clear and temperatures warmed rapidly. With the cloud cover, the temperature at Fresno was between 70-72 degrees for most of the morning of the 31st. But once the clouds began to clear, the temperature warmed at a rate of 8 degrees per hour from 11 AM to 1 PM (reaching 88 degrees), and topped out at 97 degrees at 5 PM.|Both Bakersfield and Fresno were 0.6 degrees warmer than normal for July. However, July was the last month to use the 1971-2000 30-year climatological normals. The new normals, for 1981-2010, were implemented of August 1st. The new average temperature for July is slightly warmer than the 1971-2000 average.

However, an upper level low moved from the Great Basin into central California on the 9th. This atypical movement of the low occurred because it was cut off from the prevailing westerly winds aloft. These systems usually move into the area from the Pacific Ocean. This low changed the flow aloft over the region to southeasterly, drawing moisture into central California from Arizona and northwestern Mexico. This warm, unstable airmass brought showers and thunderstorms to much of interior central California from the 9th through the 14th. Isolated thunderstorms continued over the Sierra Nevada crest on the 15th, as residual moisture remained over the area while the southeasterly flow transitioned to a more southwesterly direction. ||The low meandered across central and southern California during these several days. This low allowed for unstable conditions over the entire district; quite a few locations in the San Joaquin Valley received at least a trace of rain. On the 9th, thunderstorms produced little rainfall, but they did cause quite a few wildfires due to lightning over the mountains in Kern County (around Keene, Breckenridge, and just to the east of Arvin and Bakersfield). As for the 10th, numerous thunderstorms developed over Kern County and much of the southern San Joaquin Valley during the evening. In addition, more wildfires developed over the Kern County mountains A severe thunderstorm warning and numerous significant weather advisories were issued throughout Kern County that evening; these storms moved westward into San Luis Obispo County later that night. Afternoon showers and thunderstorms redeveloped mainly over the Tehachapi Mountains and the Southern Sierra Nevada daily on the 11th, 12th, and 13th, and a few showers occurred over the south end of the San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield, on the 13th. Thunderstorms that developed over the Piutes during the afternoon of September 11th were nearly stationary, and runoff from these storms caused road flooding in the area south of Lake Isabella. ||The South Lightning Tennessee Fire occurred in Tulare county 5 miles north of Fountain Springs. Reports indicated that the fire began on 9/11/11 at 1200 PDT due to heavy lightning strikes from thunderstorms. ||The Tamarack wildfire occurred just northeast of Yosemite Valley in Mariposa County on 9/13/11 at 1912 PDT.

However, an upper level low moved from the Great Basin into central California on the 9th. This atypical movement of the low occurred because it was cut off from the prevailing westerly winds aloft. These systems usually move into the area from the Pacific Ocean. This low changed the flow aloft over the region to southeasterly, drawing moisture into central California from Arizona and northwestern Mexico. This warm, unstable airmass brought showers and thunderstorms to much of interior central California from the 9th through the 14th. Isolated thunderstorms continued over the Sierra Nevada crest on the 15th, as residual moisture remained over the area while the southeasterly flow transitioned to a more southwesterly direction. ||The low meandered across central and southern California during these several days. This low allowed for unstable conditions over the entire district; quite a few locations in the San Joaquin Valley received at least a trace of rain. On the 9th, thunderstorms produced little rainfall, but they did cause quite a few wildfires due to lightning over the mountains in Kern County (around Keene, Breckenridge, and just to the east of Arvin and Bakersfield). As for the 10th, numerous thunderstorms developed over Kern County and much of the southern San Joaquin Valley during the evening. In addition, more wildfires developed over the Kern County mountains A severe thunderstorm warning and numerous significant weather advisories were issued throughout Kern County that evening; these storms moved westward into San Luis Obispo County later that night. Afternoon showers and thunderstorms redeveloped mainly over the Tehachapi Mountains and the Southern Sierra Nevada daily on the 11th, 12th, and 13th, and a few showers occurred over the south end of the San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield, on the 13th. Thunderstorms that developed over the Piutes during the afternoon of September 11th were nearly stationary, and runoff from these storms caused road flooding in the area south of Lake Isabella. ||The South Lightning Tennessee Fire occurred in Tulare county 5 miles north of Fountain Springs. Reports indicated that the fire began on 9/11/11 at 1200 PDT due to heavy lightning strikes from thunderstorms. ||The Tamarack wildfire occurred just northeast of Yosemite Valley in Mariposa County on 9/13/11 at 1912 PDT. This wildfire was caused by extensive lightning. The size was 480 acres. The fire was contained on 10/6/11. There were no lost fatalities or structures. Cost to containment was $75,000. ||The Breckenridge wildfire Complex occurred in the Kern County Mountains, 10 miles NE of Bakersfield. The fire started on the 10th and was contained on the 17th, and caused by lightning strikes. The size was a whopping 25,213 acres. There were no fatalities or structures lost. The cost to containment was $7.1 million. ||The Comanche wildfire Complex in Kern County mountains occurred on 9/10/11 at  0400 PDT, about 8 miles Southeast of Arvin, caused by lightning. The size was a whopping 29,338 acres. Containment was reached on 9/16/11. There were no fatalities or lost structures. The cost to containment was $6.8 million. ||The Keene wildfire Complex occurred because on lightning on 9/10/11 at 1200 PDT. The location was along the Highway 58 corridor from Keene to Mojave in Kern County. The size was 10,479 acres. Containment was reached on 9/15/11. There were no fatalities or Structures Lost.

A couple of strong storms developed by mid afternoon along this boundary and brought isolated wind damage to the Bluegrass Region. Later that afternoon, scattered severe storms developed under highly unstable conditions across southern Indiana, aided by the approach of a southward moving upper level disturbance. As these storms crossed the Ohio River, they grew upscale into several bowing segments. By evening, two of these segments merged south of Louisville into a squall line that brought widespread damaging winds to much of central Kentucky. Most locations experienced a strong gust front with at least 45 mph winds. Several Kentucky mesonet sites measured winds in excess of 58 mph.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Lightning struck a group of people out on the Ohio River, injuring one of them.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An 18 year old boy, a recent high school graduate, was attending a summer church camp.  The boy was struck by lightning while playing left field during a softball game.  The bolt passed through his entire body.  His hair was singed.  His tennis shoes had holes in them.  He fell to his back and was stiff as a board.  He was not breathing and did not have a pulse.  Fellow teammates performed CPR for about 10 to 15 minutes until EMS arrived.  He was taken to a local hospital, then transported to a Morgantown hospital.  Eventually, he was sent to a burn center in Pittsburgh.  A week later he was recovering.  He was to be moved to a rehabilitation center which was closer to home.||Two other players were knocked to the ground during the strike, but were not injured.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Behind the cold front, gusty winds developed over the mountains and deserts on the 19th. The winds began during the early morning hours, with a gust to 60 mph at Bear Peak in Tulare County, and a gust to 53 mph at Mojave, during the pre-dawn hours. Winds gusted over 45 mph in the eastern Kern County desert during the morning and early afternoon of the 19th, and gusts to 50 mph were recorded in the Piutes.||An upper-level ridge of high pressure returned to California on the 19th behind the departing low-pressure system. High temperatures warmed to above normal for the next several days before the next storm arrived during the afternoon of February 26th. This warming trend peaked with Bakersfield hitting 81 degrees on the 25th, and Fresno reaching 80 degrees. This was the first time either city had seen 80 degrees since November 10th, 2013.||The storm that reached the central California interior on February 26th was the first of two closely-spaced systems. Together, the two storms brought as much as 4 inches of rain to the Southern Sierra Nevada foothills, and over an inch of rain to the Kern County deserts. Fresno had a three-day storm total of 1.11 inch, bringing the total rainfall for February to 2.11 inch. This was 0.08 inch greater than the normal of 2.03 inches and was the first time since December 2012 that Fresno had above-normal rainfall for a month.||The south end of the San Joaquin Valley was rain-shadowed, with Bakersfield receiving only 0.28 inch of rain, almost all of which fell from the second storm on February 28th. The second storm was located off the central California coast, and was impressive on satellite pictures with a tightly-wound structure and a clear center much like the eye of a tropical system. The circulation around the storm produced a southerly wind over the Tehachapi Mountains which funneled through Tejon Pass and down the Grapevine into the south end of the San Joaquin Valley. Winds gusted as high as 89 mph at Grapevine Peak, and to 50 mph at Sunflower Valley on the west side of the Valley. At Buck Rock, in the Sierra Nevada in Tulare County, winds gusted to 66 mph.|Several thunderstorms were spawned by the storms, with the second system being the most potent. Numerous trees were toppled in both the San Joaquin Valley and the Sierra foothills by winds, in many cases pulling down power lines. One thunderstorm at Squaw Valley in the foothills produced a gust estimated at 65 mph, which toppled trees and damaged the roof of a garage. On the Valley floor, there were reports of houses and parked vehicles damaged by falling trees or large limbs. Near Fresno, a tree 3 feet in diameter was toppled.||Street flooding was reported at several locations, not only in the San Joaquin Valley but also in eastern Kern County where the Garlock Road flooded. (Garlock Road is prone to flooding from runoff from the El Paso Mountains.). In Dinuba, water covering the road was estimated at 8 to 12 inches deep. ||In the Southern Sierra Nevada, estimates of new snowfalls were as high as four feet. (These were Snotel observations; a post-storm snow survey had not been conducted at the time of this summary.)||February 2014 was much warmer than normal, and was Fresno���s warmest February on record. Bakersfield tied for its 6th warmest February on record.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Lightning caused an injury to a man who was in an oil field near Fresno.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms developed over Iowa during the early afternoon and organized into a forward-propagating quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) and tracked to southern Lake Michigan by early to mid evening. Meanwhile, a second complex of intense thunderstorms developed over central and eastern Iowa and also evolved into a QLCS, tracking across northern Illinois and northwest Indiana late in the evening into the overnight hours. ||Across northern Illinois and northwest Indiana, the first derecho event produced scattered straight-line wind damage, with gusts measured as high as 70 MPH.  The second derecho produced far more extensive damage, with 80 to 90 MPH straight line winds and numerous tornadoes.  Initial post-event surveys cataloged 18 tornadoes across northern Illinois and northwest Indiana, 17 of EF1 intensity and one of EF0 intensity.  Of these 18 tornadoes, 14 were associated with a pair of large mesovortices that traveled along the Kankakee River Valley in Kankakee County, Illinois and Lake, Newton, and Jasper Counties in Indiana.  ||Analysis of Google Earth satellite imagery gathered in spring of 2015 showed numerous additional areas of damage not documented in the original survey efforts.  A thorough analysis of this imagery and synthesis with the original survey information led to a complete reanalysis of the Kankakee Valley tornadoes.  Ultimately, 18 tornado tracks were identified alone in the Kankakee Valley, leading to a total of 22 tornadoes for northern Illinois and northwest Indiana. Of the 18 revised tornadoes, 16 of the paths were determined, in part, using satellite imagery. Further re-examination of the damage also led to a change in rating for several of the damage locations. Of the 18 reanalyzed Kankakee Valley tracks, two were rated EF2, 13 were rated EF1, and three were rated EF0. Additional details on this reanalysis, including the methods used, can be found in the Electronic Journal of Severe Storms Meteorology (Lyza et al. 2019, ���A Multi-Platform Reanalysis of the Kankakee Valley Tornado Cluster on 30 June 2014���).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A home on the 15700 block of Peggy Lane was struck by lightning sparking a fire.

The main area of showers and thunderstorms was oriented southwest to northeast from northern San Diego County and Orange County through the Inland Empire and up into San Bernardino County high deserts, training over this area for most of the day and night of the 23rd. Two-day rainfall totals were from one-quarter to one inch for most areas and locally just over one inch on the coastal slopes of the San Bernardino mountains. San Diego county had the least with 0.25 or less and the most was the greater Riverside area with up to an inch of rain. Minor street flooding occurred in Orange and Riverside Counties.  Several power poles were downed or burned due to lightning strikes. One strike hit a football player practicing at Grossmont High School in El Cajon, but he survived.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A teenage football player was sent to the emergency room after getting struck by lightning at Grossmont High School.

This allowed a very warm and excessively humid air mass to be in place over the area.  As temperatures rose through the 80s and into the 90s, dewpoints were unusually high in the mid to upper 70s.  By the afternoon hours, this produced heat index values over 100 degrees in many valley areas, with some spots in the mid-Hudson Valley seeing heat index values approach 110 degrees.||At the same time, a surface cold front was approaching the area from the west.  Some clusters of thunderstorms developed in the early to mid afternoon hours across the Lake George-Saratoga Region, producing damage to trees and power lines.  In addition, one storm in the Lake George area contained a lightning strike, which injured multiple people huddled under a tree.||By the evening hours, a more organized line of thunderstorms moved from west to east across all of eastern Upstate New York.  This line produced widespread wind damage, with the most concentrated damage in the Pine Lake area of northwestern Fulton County. ||In addition to the gusty winds, the thunderstorms also produced a significant amount of cloud-to-ground lightning. Over 50,000 customers lost power at the height of the storms as a result of the gusty winds and lightning strikes.||Thunderstorms ended with the passage of the cold front during the overnight hours.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Fifteen people were injured at the Lake George Battlefield Park due to a lightning strike and needed to be hospitalized.

The line intensified as it approached the Mississippi River and caused wind damage and tornadoes. As the convective system evolved into Mississippi, numerous tornadoes developed along the advancing line, with the most prolific damage occurring along the track of a large meso-scale convective vortex (MCV). This feature tracked roughly from Claiborne County through western Hinds/Madison, eastern Yazoo, eastern Holmes, southeastern Carroll, Montgomery, and northwestern Webster counties. This corridor is where the most significant damage occurred, as well as one fatality. Flash flooding, hail, and other wind damage occurred as these storms moved through.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A person was struck by lightning as they were getting inside their truck.

During the daylight hours of the 7th, precipitation to the east of the NJ Turnpike/Interstate 95 turned over to snow, as colder air worked in from the north and west. ||The snow fell heavy at times away from the coast.  Snowfall amounts near the Turnpike generally ranged from 6 to 12 inches, with a sharp decrease to the southeast. Further northwest, 12 to 24 inches was observed across large parts of Somerset, Hunterdon, Morris, and Sussex Counties.||The snow contained large amounts of liquid, making it heavy and wet. This resulted in downed trees, limbs, and wires, leading to numerous power outages across portions of New Jersey, especially where the heaviest snow was reported. Many customers were still without power from the previous storm when this storm struck. Governor Murphy estimated about 350,000 customers state-wide lost power as a result of this second storm.||There were numerous reports of lightning associated with the precipitation in New Jersey, mainly southeast of the Turnpike. This included thunderstorms with heavy rainfall closer to the coast, and thunder with heavy snowfall further inland. In Ocean County, a person was struck by lightning in Manchester Township, and a lightning strike led to a house fire in Ship Bottom.||Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency which went into effect at 8 PM Tuesday March 6th.||Flights were cancelled at all the major airports due to the storm, and Amtrak cancelled at least some Wednesday service.||An accident involving ten tractor-trailers closed all four lanes of the New Jersey bound span of the Delaware Memorial Bridge for over two hours on Wednesday, March 7th.  Large amounts of snow that accumulated in a short period of time was blamed for the crash. The trucks did not actually crash into each other, rather they got stuck in the snow as they were climbing the ramp on the east-bound bridge.||Minor flooding was reported along some portions of the New Jersey coast, particularly north of Atlantic City, but there were no major problems.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A broad area of low pressure extending from the Ohio Valley to the Piedmont of South Carolina consolidated off the Virginia Capes during the early morning of March 7th.

Much heavier rainfall began to spread further northward during the afternoon and evening of the 16th prompting numerous Flash Flood Warnings and causing significant flood impacts.  The highest observed rain amounts in Virginia within the HSA were over parts of southwest Floyd and northwest Patrick counties with over 8 inches in 24 hours (ending at 700 AM on the 17th) and 9 to 10 inches storm total.

At 1721 LST, a man was found unconscious by his neighbors on a small pontoon boat at his home on Lake Owen, on the 40000th block of Long Island Drive in Umatilla. The neighbors called the Lake County Sheriffs Office, and first responders transported the man to a local hospital where he was pronounced deceased. The medical examiners office determined the cause of death to be electrocution, and this is further supported by burn marks found on the seat and floor of the boat. NWS Melbourne meteorologists determined the lightning strike occurred around 1258 LST, this was confirmed by reports from the neighbors who heard loud bang of the strike many hours before finding the deceased man on his boat.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This made it the largest December tornado outbreak in the state of Illinois since 1957, and the third largest tornado outbreak across Illinois in any month since 1950.  Within the National Weather Service Lincoln County Warning Area (CWA), 20 tornadoes touched down...with the most significant being an EF-3 tornado that tore through the city of Taylorville in Christian County.  Despite several communities being directly impacted and experiencing major damage, there were no fatalities reported.  The severe weather was caused by a deep area of low pressure that tracked from eastern Kansas into north-central Illinois.  Warm air surging northward ahead of the low allowed temperatures to soar into the upper 50s and lower 60s, resulting in a narrow corridor of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values of 500-1000J/kg ahead of an approaching occluded front.  Thanks to ample low-level wind shear, numerous supercell thunderstorms developed within the instability axis by mid to late afternoon.  Many of the storms produced tornadoes over the next several hours before the storms gradually weakened by mid-evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A lightning strike injured a person in Huntsville in Schuyler County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An organized line of severe thunderstorms formed over the central Plains states during the night of the 20th. This bowing line of storms progressed southeast across the St. Louis area during the midday hours, then down across the lower Ohio Valley and southeast Missouri during the afternoon. Widespread wind damage was reported in parts of southern Illinois, especially in far southern areas from the Marion-Carbondale area southward to the Ohio River. Flash flooding was reported in a few locations. The atmosphere ahead of the storms became strongly unstable, with surface-based capes exceeding 4,000. Given the strong buoyancy, wind profiles were sufficiently strong for widespread severe weather. Deep-layer (0-6 km) wind shear values were no higher than about 30 knots, and 0-1 km shear was about 20 knots. Even though the region was under a broad 500 mb ridge, a moderately strong low-level feed of very moist and unstable air fueled the intense storms as they propagated southeastward.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 31-year-old man was struck by lightning while riding a lawn mower.

A fairly large shield of rain, with a few embedded thunderstorms, moved northeast across south central Nebraska from late morning through mid-afternoon. Behind this area of rain, numerous scattered, poorly-organized thunderstorms moved in from Kansas. Between 5 and 7 PM CST, mostly low-end severe hail occurred at various locations from near Alma northeastward to Aurora. The one exception was golf ball size hail that fell a few miles north of Hampton, in Hamilton county.||These storms were elevated as the area was on the cold side of the low pressure system that moved through on the 22nd. By the time these severe thunderstorms occurred, the low was exiting the Great Lakes. The cold front extended southwest, across Kansas, to another low pressure system over Colorado and New Mexico. High pressure was over Nebraska. The flow aloft was highly-amplified with southwest flow over the central Plains a longwave trough and upper low were over the Western U.S., and a ridge was over the East. Surface temperatures and dewpoints were in the 50s. Mid-level lapse rates were 6.5-7.0 C/km, and MUCAPE was between 500 and 1000 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was 60-70 kt.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Investigators with the Nebraska State Fire Marshal���s Office determined that lightning was the cause of a very large fire that completely destroyed the Cooperative Producers Inc. Dry Fertilizer Facility. This facility opened in July 2018, and was located just east of the intersection of Highway 6 and Showboat Road. Hastings Rural Fire District, along with firefighters from 4 other fire districts, helped contain the fire. The fire was contained by 3 AM CDT, but firefighters were on scene to address hotspots well into Friday. Two injuries were reported as a result of the fire, both injured parties were treated and released at a local hospital within hours of the fire. The injured parties were semi drivers on site at the time of the fire. Damage is estimated to be at least $5 million worth of product at the plant with a facility cost of $14 million.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 19.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These type of wind speeds continued across portions of Yellow Medicine and Lac Qui Parle counties where hundreds of trees and power lines were blown down. There was another wind gust of 68 mph at the Department of Transportation road sensor (Near Hanley Falls, MN) that went offline as the gust was recorded. ||The worst area occurred in the city of Granite Falls where winds tore open two roofs and allowed water to pour through ventilation ducts into classrooms and hallways, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage to the Yellow Medicine East School District building. The Granite Fun restaurant and golf course also sustained damage with 55 to 60 trees blown down. Due to the extensive damage, the city of Granite Falls declared a state of emergency. ||Although wind damage occurred east of Granite Falls, mainly between Sacred Heart to Renville, this storm weakened as it moved eastward toward the western part of the Twin Cities.||A secondary area of storms developed across south central Minnesota during the mid-late afternoon near New Ulm, and produced another area of significant wind damage eastward toward Cannon Falls, and Red Wing. There was a swath of tree damage around Cannon Falls where one house lost its roof, with other having minor roof damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A lightning bolt struck a park shelter where 40 people were attending a birthday party.

He saw it split between a tree and the metal fence and immediately felt tingling and cramping in his feet and lower back. Another firefighter was in the process of latching the metal fence gate when he felt a jolt go through his harm and his arm tingling. There were no serious injuries between the three firefighters and all refused treatment, even though they were shivering badly and were experiencing the early stages of hypothermia from being exposed to the heavy rain and hail.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
