All were treated for hypothermia and released. The men left the Capes Shore Beach between the state fishing pier and the Cape Shores pier at about 315 p.m. EDT on the 16th and were headed for Lewes. They were about 600 yards offshore, where the winds and waves increased. Winds were estimated at about 25 knots. A large wave hit the two-man kayak. It took on water and a panicked man leaned into the waves and overturned the kayak. They were unable to right it. They then took turns in and out of the remaining one-man kayak which after about 15 minutes also was flipped. They were spotted in the water by a Cape Henlopen State Park ranger. A Delaware State Police helicopter and a patrol boat of the State Division of Fish and Wildlife Enforcement assisted in the rescue. They were in the water for about 40 minutes and ocean water temperatures were in the mid 50s.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An associated strong pressure gradient and lingering unstable conditions over Lake Michigan allowed strong gusty north to northeast winds to mix down to the lake surface.  The lake surface temperature at this time was estimated to be in the 54 to 58 degree range.  Wind gusts reached 50 to 70 mph along the lake shore.  The strong winds caused high waves of 12 to 16 feet.  The strong winds and high waves caused extensive damage to boats in the South Shore Yacht Club, mainly due to an eroding and failing breakwall protecting the southern part of Milwaukee Harbor.  Three boats were totally destroyed at the yacht club.  Four others were washed ashore and were able to be salvaged.  Two of the destroyed boats were sunk.  One person at the Club, while trying to secure a boat with a rope line, was tossed about on the boat due to wave action and injured (directly-related).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Measured at MLWW3 marine observation platform.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
