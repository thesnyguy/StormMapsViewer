Abundant low level moisture was already in place across southeast Texas. Very strong shear, or turning and strengthening of the winds with height, was expected to last throughout the day. A warm front moved northward throughout the day and became a focus for the development of showers and thunderstorms. With the strong shear present, a significant number of thunderstorms quickly became severe. During an eighteen hour stretch, ten tornadoes and several large hail events were reported mainly north and west of the Houston area.  Locations from the Houston area to the beaches felt the brunt of this event in the evening when a squall line rapidly moved eastward toward the coast. Three injuries and over $800,000 in damage occurred with this outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> TV tower fell on trailor.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Two of the structures had the roofs removed.  However, most of the damage was the result of downed trees. on the structures.  Numerous trees and several power lines were also blown down.  One tree fell on the city's new dump truck causing damage.  The Jackson Progress Argus newspaper reported that the city of Jenkinsburg not only suffered substantial property loses, but also lost some of its most prized hardwood trees that had graced the city streets for over 100 years.  These trees were uprooted and blown down on homes, barns (including a one year-old workshop) up and down Oak Street, one of the most historic streets in Jenkinsburg.  Most of the storm damage occurred within a one mile square area within town.  Several residents of the apartment buildings had to be moved to temporary shelters.  One eight year-old girl at the Miller apartments was injured by debris and had to be taken to a local hospital.  Several others received bruises and scratches from the storm debris.   The governor declared Butts county to be in a state of emergency.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 450K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The event featured marginal severe wind gusts and some hail.Dime size hail fell at the intersection of Lois Avenue and Broad Street in the Pinecrest section of Tampa shortly after 11 AM.  Winds intensified as the line organized farther inland, causing sporadic damage in Polk, Hardee, and Highlands Counties.  The strongest cells were in Hardee County.  A small tornado was witnessed by law enforcement officials near Zolfo Springs, with minor tree damage in a wooded area.  Numerous small, and several large, tree limbs were downed in Zolfo Springs along West 66th Street, and dime size hail was reported, shortly after 1230 PM.  In Polk County, observed 58 mph winds at Lakeland's Linder Field were followed by blown down large limbs and power lines in the city proper.   A woman sustained a neck injury when a large limb crashed onto the roof of her vehicle.  Several hundred customers were briefly without power after the storm.  Other tree and line damage, including a few uprooted oaks,  was noted from a separate storm cell in Fort Meade.   Dime size hail was reported near Bartow and in downtown Lakeland.  Most of the activity occurred in the county between noon and 1230 PM.As the line continued moving southeast, more damage was reported in Avon Park and Sebring (Highlands Co) around 1 PM.  Gusty winds blew a carport roof off an Apartment Building along Lakeview Road in Sebring.  Fallen trees also  blocked vehicle access along a rural road (CR 634) in Highlands Hammock S.P. near Avon Park.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 12K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The high winds damaged roofs, propelled hail into homes and cars, and knocked over power poles.  About ten persons were injured by the flying debris.  The greatest devastation was in southwest Bexar County just northeast of the town of Lytle.  Emergency management and Red Cross officials estimated 50 mobile homes and houses severely damaged or destroyed, with minor damage to another 100 mobile homes and houses.  In addition to the widespread downburst damage, evidence was found of small and short-lived tornadoes.  It was very difficult to separate the widespread downburst-wind damage from the tornado damage.  The main clues were that the downburst damage was almost exclusively along a southwest to northeast path and showed a consistent and gradual gradient of damage levels from the worst of the damage to the least of the damage.  The tornado damage indicated completely different direction of movement and very strong, pronounced gradients of damage.  Often a structure would be completely destroyed, with structures to the right and left of it nearly untouched.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This arctic front and the large temperature gradient across it combined with a vigorous upper level disturbance ejecting from the Southwestern United States to ignite severe thunderstorms.

Damage in the south part of the county was more spotty than over the north part. An anemometer at a school weather network in Seguin measured the wind gusts at 59 knots.  Near Zorn, the high winds took sections of roofs off homes, and rolled and damaged several homes and mobile homes. One mobile home had been rolled over a truck and was completely destroyed.  Close inspection of the damage revealed a divergent, fan-shaped path of damage with the strongest damage in the center portion where the mobile home was destroyed, and lesser damage on both sides.  To the left, another mobile home was moved, but with only minor damage.  To the right, a tractor was rolled for a short distance.  This damage was clearly due to a downburst.  One woman, on hearing the NWS warning, evacuated her mobile home and drove with her son to her mother's house nearby.  When she returned, her mobile home had been destroyed.  Both likely escaped severe injuries by getting to shelter.

The driver and another passenger in the care were also injured.  The width of the microburst appeared to be the widest through the Irwin area where it reached close to 700 yards.  Hundreds of trees were either uprooted or snapped.  Many utility poles and wires were also knocked down or snapped.  There was damage to several roofs, porches and decks.  One roof over the back porch of a house was lifted up and over the house and deposited in the front yard.  there were many houses that lost shingles, siding and awnings.

This macroburst produced an approximately 10-mile long path of damage from the straight-line winds, which were estimated as high as 105 MPH.  The macroburst damage path originated in the Homestead area of eastern Allegheny County, with the outflow winds traveling to the southeast through the towns of Whitaker, West Mifflin and Duquesne.  The macroburst outflow then continued across the Monongahela River into the towns of McKeesport and North Versailles.  Outflow winds from this macroburst continued to the southeast, weakening as it crossed into Westmoreland County, where it produced damage in several communities in North Huntington Township.  By this time, the winds had decreased significantly, but were still strong enough to down numerous trees and power lines across the area.  The maximum width of this macroburst was estimated at 3 miles as it traveled through the Munhall area.  The highest concentrated area of damage extended from the Whitaker area to West Mifflin, where major damage occurred at the Kennywood Amusement Park.  A large wooden pavilion which housed the "Whip" ride collapsed.  As the pavilion collapsed it killed one person and injured 47 others.  Just across the street from Kennywood, several homes sustained major damage from the winds as roofs were blown off and trees were blown onto homes.  Kennywood Boulevard was impassible for a period of time following the storm as a tangle of power lines and traffic light, trees, roof debris and damaged vehicles blocked the highway.  A total of approximately 75,000 customers were without power across eastern Allegheny County, with another 14,000 customers affected across Westmoreland County.  Although power was restored to most homes by the next morning, some customer in the hardest hit areas of West Mifflin were without power for several days.  Allegheny County officials placed initial damage estimates at $10 million.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Most storms produced winds around 60 mph and hail up to the size of golf balls.  One storm packed winds in excess of 80 mph around the Portis and Harlan areas.  The winds blew over 70 empty train cars and caused extensive crop damage.  A passenger in a truck traveling along U.S. Highway 281 was struck by a piece of wood that flew into the window.  The man was transported to a local hospital then airlifted to a Wichita hospital for additional treatment.  Many areas, especially in Smith and Jewell counties, reported crops as a total loss.  The damage in Jewell county was described as being destroyed to "table top" status.  Tree limbs, power poles and farm outbuildings were damaged in many locations in the region.

Severe thunderstorm winds and tornadoes downed trees and power lines and damaged buildings across a large swath of central, north central and east central Wisconsin.  Thousands of trees and power lines were downed by high winds from the storms.  An 11 year old Boy Scout was killed and another was seriously injured when trees landed on their tent at Camp Napowan (Waushara co.).High winds pushed a house off its foundation and blew a boat and trailer into a neighbor's yard near Merrill (Lincoln co.).  Some downed trees damaged or destroyed buildings or vehicles when they fell.  A church steeple was toppled by high winds and a tree landed on an SUV, boat and trailer in Neenah (Winnebago co.)  According to utility company news releases, nearly 20,000 customers were without power at some time during the storms.  As of noon the next day there were still about 3,250 customers in the Green Bay (Brown co.) area without electricity.The hardest hit areas appeared to be in Marathon, Lincoln, Shawano and Oconto counties.  Three of the four confirmed tornadoes touched down in Lincoln county and the other touched down in Marathon county.   A tornado that touched down 5 miles north of Merrill (Lincoln co.) skipped along the ground for 9 miles, destroying a barn and another structure, tearing roofs from some buildings and moving others from their foundations.  Another tornado briefly touched down about 8.5 miles northeast of Merrill demolishing a mobile home and snapping trees and tree limbs.  The other Lincoln county tornado touched down 10 miles northwest of Merrill and skipped along the ground for 1.25 miles.  A tornado skipped along the ground for 2 miles in Mosinee (Marathon co.) causing significant tree damage on a hill east of the Wisconsin River.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The winds caused extensive tree damage and also destroyed a house just northwest of Ft. Calhoun causing 2 minor injuries.

It began in Fayette County, just east of the Sipsey River about 6 miles north-northeast of the city of Fayette at 8:15 pm. The tornado moved northeast, crossing portions of State Routes 102 and 13, and then SR 102 again around Stoddards Crossroads.The tornado crossed into Walker County at 8:34 pm and traveled through sparsely populated areas of western Walker County. It crossed the interchange of US Highway 78 about 5.5 miles east-southeast of Carbon Hill, and became very strong as it traveled through the Saragossa area. It crossed State Roads 5, 195, and 257, before entering Winston County.The tornado appeared to be at its most intense during the travel from US 78/SR 118 interchange across Saragossa and the areas near SR 5 and SR 195. Seven deaths occurred in this 10 mile stretch of the tornado track, along with an estimated 40 injuries.At 9:03 pm the tornado crossed the extreme southeastern tip of Winston County, crossing a part of Smith Lake.The tornado entered Cullman County at 9:08 pm, moving across portions of Smith Lake and across CR 222. Tornado intensity remained high during the first several miles after it entered Cullman County. Continuing northeast, it crossed Interstate 65 and US 31 just south of Cullman on the southside of the Cullman Golf Course.The tornado seemed to be significantly less intense as it continued to travel northeasterly toward Holly Pond. Damage from just east of US 31 to just south of Holly Pond was not nearly as intense as it was west of Interstate 65. Traveling through mostly rural areas downing trees and powerlines, and damaging scattered structures along the way, the tornado finally ended just south-southeast of Holly Pond at 9:52 pm, This was the longest tornado of the outbreak, with a path length of 72.6 miles and a width of 1100 yards. It was the second F3 tornado of the day. Seven deaths were reported with the storm, all in Walker County, along with an estimated 45 injuries.Structural damage details are difficult to report since reporting is based primarily on county and not by individual tornadoes.  Based on EMA and Red Cross data, structures damaged or destroyed were approximately 20 in Fayette County, 300 in Walker County, 5 in Winston County, and 164 in Cullman County.This is also one of the longest tornadoes tracks in recent history. At 72.6 miles in length, this becomes the fourth longest tornado in Alabama since 1950.Beg:  33 45.072/87 45.991  End:  34 09.775/86 36.403<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It began in Fayette County, just east of the Sipsey River about 6 miles north-northeast of the city of Fayette at 8:15 pm. The tornado moved northeast, crossing portions of State Routes 102 and 13, and then SR 102 again around Stoddards Crossroads.The tornado crossed into Walker County at 8:34 pm and traveled through sparsely populated areas of western Walker County. It crossed the interchange of US Highway 78 about 5.5 miles east-southeast of Carbon Hill, and became very strong as it traveled through the Saragossa area. It crossed State Roads 5, 195, and 257, before entering Winston County.The tornado appeared to be at its most intense during the travel from US 78/SR 118 interchange across Saragossa and the areas near SR 5 and SR 195. Seven deaths occurred in this 10 mile stretch of the tornado track, along with an estimated 40 injuries.At 9:03 pm the tornado crossed the extreme southeastern tip of Winston County, crossing a part of Smith Lake.The tornado entered Cullman County at 9:08 pm, moving across portions of Smith Lake and across CR 222. Tornado intensity remained high during the first several miles after it entered Cullman County. Continuing northeast, it crossed Interstate 65 and US 31 just south of Cullman on the southside of the Cullman Golf Course.The tornado seemed to be significantly less intense as it continued to travel northeasterly toward Holly Pond. Damage from just east of US 31 to just south of Holly Pond was not nearly as intense as it was west of Interstate 65. Traveling through mostly rural areas downing trees and powerlines, and damaging scattered structures along the way, the tornado finally ended just south-southeast of Holly Pond at 9:52 pm, This was the longest tornado of the outbreak, with a path length of 72.6 miles and a width of 1100 yards. It was the second F3 tornado of the day. Seven deaths were reported with the storm, all in Walker County, along with an estimated 45 injuries.Structural damage details are difficult to report since reporting is based primarily on county and not by individual tornadoes.  Based on EMA and Red Cross data, structures damaged or destroyed were approximately 20 in Fayette County, 300 in Walker County, 5 in Winston County, and 164 in Cullman County.This is also one of the longest tornadoes tracks in recent history. At 72.6 miles in length, this becomes the fourth longest tornado in Alabama since 1950.Beg:  33 45.072/87 45.991  End:  34 09.775/86 36.403<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.3M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It began in Fayette County at 6:52 pm, about 5.6 miles north-northwest of the city of Fayette, and 2.8 miles west of US Highway 43. The tornado moved on a northeast track crossing US 43, State Route 129, and SR 13, and then moved into Walker County just southwest of Carbon Hill at 7:10 pm.It then crossed the western and northern sections of Carbon Hill, downing trees and power lines and damaging many residential structures. Carbon Hill Elementary School was also heavily damaged. The tornado continued northeast, crossing SR5, and exited the county at SR 195. The two deaths associated with this tornado occurred just south of SR 195.Entering Winston County at 7:31 pm, the tornado continued on a northeast path traveling across mostly sparsely populated areas of Bankhead National Forest and several fingers of Smith Lake. It crossed County Road 41 about 1.8 miles south of Arley and then crossed CR 12, finally lifting at 7:45 pm.This tornado was rated an F3 on the Fujita scale, with winds estimated to be in the 150 to 200 mph range. Much of the damage along the track was lesser intensity (F1 and F2).  F3 damage occurred in both Fayette and Walker Counties.Total path length for the Carbon Hill Tornado was 44.3 miles, with a width of 1175 yards. Four deaths were reported with this tornado, three in the Rose Hill community of Walker County and one near Arley in Winston County.  Injury figures are approximate with three in Fayette County, 20 in Walker County, and 15 in Winston County.  About 40 percent of the injuries were treated at local hospitals while about 60 percent of the injuries were considered minor.Structural damage along the path included approximately 47 in Fayette County, 135 in Walker County, and 35 in Winston County.  Numbers are approximate because most reports from Red Cross and EMA were made based on the whole county not by tornado.Beg:  33 45.949/87 51.069  End:  34 03.992/87 10.409<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> .5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It began in Fayette County at 6:52 pm, about 5.6 miles north-northwest of the city of Fayette, and 2.8 miles west of US Highway 43. The tornado moved on a northeast track crossing US 43, State Route 129, and SR 13, and then moved into Walker County just southwest of Carbon Hill at 7:10 pm.It then crossed the western and northern sections of Carbon Hill, downing trees and power lines and damaging many residential structures. Carbon Hill Elementary School was also heavily damaged. The tornado continued northeast, crossing SR5, and exited the county at SR 195. The two deaths associated with this tornado occurred just south of SR 195.Entering Winston County at 7:31 pm, the tornado continued on a northeast path traveling across mostly sparsely populated areas of Bankhead National Forest and several fingers of Smith Lake. It crossed County Road 41 about 1.8 miles south of Arley and then crossed CR 12, finally lifting at 7:45 pm.This tornado was rated an F3 on the Fujita scale, with winds estimated to be in the 150 to 200 mph range. Much of the damage along the track was lesser intensity (F1 and F2).  F3 damage occurred in both Fayette and Walker Counties.Total path length for the Carbon Hill Tornado was 44.3 miles, with a width of 1175 yards. Four deaths were reported with this tornado, three in the Rose Hill community of Walker County and one near Arley in Winston County.

Once again, the National Weather Service disaster survey team determined that this was a multi-segmented tornado, with much of the damage along the path caused by straight line winds of at least 70 mph.  The tornado entered the county southwest of Cagle, then continued on to just north of Tate roughly paralleling Georgia Highway 108, then turned more eastward along Georgia Highway 53 to near Marblehill, through the Big Canoe golf course and recreation area, then east of Big Canoe into extreme western Dawson county.  There was definite evidence of F2 tornadic damage just north of Tate where winds were estimated in the 113 to 157 mph range.  Some of the hardest hit areas included homes on Pleasant Union Road near the Cherokee county border; the Mountain Lakes Estates area, where several homes suffered extensive damage; the Bethany-Salem district where at least 56 structures were damaged or destroyed; Refuge Road near Tate, the town suffering some of the greatest damage where several homes and business were destroyed; the Big Canoe area near the Dawson county border, where several homes were damaged and the tennis center suffered extensive damage.  All together, a total of 26 structures, mostly residential homes were destroyed, 142 structures were partially damaged, 2 businesses were destroyed, and 14 vehicles were totally destroyed.  In addition, ten people were injured, primarily in damaged homes or trapped in vehicles on which trees fell.  One of the businesses destroyed was the popular Davis's Barbeque on Georgia Highway 108.  The restaurant was completely blown away, including the 20-foot white columns that stood in front of the restaurant.  Three of the injuries in the county occurred in new mobile homes behind the Barbeque restaurant when their homes were flattened by the winds and other debris from the restaurant.  One of the children injured, a 4-year old girl, was found by a nearby pond.  The Refuge Baptist Church suffered extensive damage and was left in shambles.  The historic Big Canoe chapel was also among the structures suffering damage.  The steeple and all of the windows were lost from the church along with other structural damage to both the exterior and interior walls.  Numerous trees were uprooted and many power lines were damaged along the path.   Thirty people had to be put up in shelters and at least 6000 people were left without power for an extended period.

Two double-wide mobile homes were completely destroyed just east of the Big Canoe area as large trees fell on the structures.  While the contents of one were salvagable, those of the other were destroyed.  Three injuries occurred at one of these mobile homes as the residents were trapped by the downed trees on the structure.  In addition, there were four other homes that received minor damage in the Big Canoe area.  Numerous trees and power lines were blown down in the area of the tornado and some roads were temporarily blocked as a result.  Dawson county was one of five counties declared in a state of emergency by the governor.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first tornado, an F0, touched down at approximately 2:45 PM EST just south of the town of Spring Church in Armstrong County.  It traveled east about 3 miles before crossing into Indiana County approximately 1 mile east of Maysville at 2:52 PM EST.  This tornado continued traveling to the east for another mile, finally dissipating near the community of Iselin at around 2:55 PM EST.  The maximum estimated winds with this tornado were about 70 MPH.Damage from this first tornado included numerous trees which were toppled or snapped.  A small steeple was toppled, and a swimming pool was destroyed.  There were several trees toppled onto houses, and some houses suffered minor wind damage.  A garage was damaged, and a house under construction was lifted off the foundation.  The same storm produced another stronger tornado, an F2, which touched down in Indiana County approximately 6 miles southwest of the city of Indiana at 3:00 PM EST.  This F2 traveled to the east across Center Township for approximately 5 miles, dissipating just south of Indiana at 3:06 PM EST.  The estimated maximum winds were around 135 MPH.  This F2 tornado produced a swath of damage as it traveled eastward across Indiana County.  One house was totally destroyed, and debris from this house was blown downwind.  In this same area, a car was turned over and trees were stripped of leaves.  An adjacent house exhibited damage from hail or flying projectiles on several sides.  The house immediately to the north of the destroyed house lost part of its east-facing roof.  There were at least an additional 18 houses damaged (roofs, shingles, siding, etc.).  Several garages and barns were either toppled or snapped.  A large sign from a hotel was blown down onto a car sales lot.  Two cars were crushed and 18 other vehicles were damaged.

This severe storm moved east at 45 MPH, damaging property all of the way to the Potomac River.  This same storm later produced a devastating F4 tornado in La Plata, MD.  While the storm moved through North Central Virginia, it produced an F2 tornado in Shenandoah County, a significant funnel cloud in Fauquier County, large hail, heavy downpours, and scattered wind damage.  In Shenandoah County, an F2 tornado touched down just east of Quicksburg near the intersection of Quicksburg Road and Old Bridge Road.  The tornado stayed on the ground for 4 miles before it dissipated while moving up the west side of Massanutten Mountain.  The twister was estimated to be about 75 yards wide and it caused a total of $1.6 million in damage.  Along the path of the tornado, three residential structures were destroyed, 12 structures were heavily damaged, and 15 had minor damage.  Four poultry houses and 15 barns were destroyed.  Five poultry houses, two silos, and a mile of fencing was also damaged.  On Old Bridge Road, a silo and three barns were damaged.  Airborne roof debris and high winds hit a tractor-trailer on I-81 and caused it to flip onto its side.  The driver of the tractor-trailer was treated for minor injuries.  The tornado moved across I-81 and Route 11 into the Kay Hill subdivision.  Homes were damaged and trees were downed on Lower and Upper Forge Road.  A mobile home on Mantz Drive was destroyed.  The tornado moved east across Smith Creek to Smith Creek Road and Franwood Lane where it caused significant damage.  A two-story home just off Smith Creek Road was severely damaged by debris from a neighbor's 60-foot-high grain silo.  A woman inside the structure was treated for bruises.  On Franwood Lane, two turkey houses were destroyed and four were severely damaged.  One dog that lived on the property was killed and another was injured.  A cat was never found.  A shed was damaged and work equipment was scattered across the property.  At Franwood Farms Airport, 5 people took shelter from the storm in a hangar.  A person in the hangar said the walls kept coming closer together as the tornado approached and eventually the roof blew off the building.  The tornado also flipped a plane on the landing strip.  The tornado's path was visible up to two miles east of Franwood Farms through a path of damaged trees in the forest.  The path of tree damage ended as the topography sloped up Massanutten Mountain into George Washington National Forest.  In addition, an orchard west of Mt. Jackson just north of the tornado's path, sustained hail damage. In Rockingham County, dime sized hail fell in Bergton for ten minutes.  In Page County, golf ball sized hail fell in Rileyville.  Power lines were downed in Stanley.  In Culpeper County, a tree was downed onto Route 522 near Route 633 in Norman.  In Fauquier County, a funnel cloud was photographed by a meteorologist on a hill near Fauquier Springs.  The time series of photos shows the funnel never reaching the ground.  High winds downed a large tree and utility poles onto Harts Mill and Spriggs roads about 5 miles west of Warrenton.  In New Baltimore, dime sized hail was reported.  In Prince William County, quarter sized hail fell in Woodbridge and Manassas.  Golf ball sized hail caused property damage in Dale City.  A total of 2.20 inches of rain fell in Canova as the storm passed through.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado injured 2 people, destroyed 4 homes, damaged 56 additional homes and 36 agricultural structures, downed numerous trees, and blew over a tractor-trailer on Interstate 81.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.6M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

However, most of the damage occurred at the school in Glen Rose.  Roofing material was peeled off several of the school buildings, with shingles from the roofs scattered in various directions around the school campus area.  The false ceiling in one of the buildings collapsed, with water damage noted in several of the other buildings that sustained roof damage.  Two large ventilators were blown over on the roof of the band hall, with several large trees knocked down on the school campus.  Several cars were also damaged by flying debris.  A teacher was injured when one of the ceilings fell.  Another teacher, who was outside when the storm struck, suffered a cut on her leg and bruises when she was blown into a chain-link fence on the playground.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At the beginning of the path, several large tree limbs were blown down.  Farther along the path, several large trees were knocked down.  However, most of the damage occurred at the school in Glen Rose.  Roofing material was peeled off several of the school buildings, with shingles from the roofs scattered in various directions around the school campus area.  The false ceiling in one of the buildings collapsed, with water damage noted in several of the other buildings that sustained roof damage.  Two large ventilators were blown over on the roof of the band hall, with several large trees knocked down on the school campus.  Several cars were also damaged by flying debris.  A teacher was injured when one of the ceilings fell.  Another teacher, who was outside when the storm struck, suffered a cut on her leg and bruises when she was blown into a chain-link fence on the playground.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornadoes it produced left a 64 mile path of destruction ranging from F1 to F4 damage.  Five people were killed, 122 were injured, and over $115 million in damage was reported. The tornadoes were spawned from a supercell thunderstorm that crossed the Potomac River from Prince William County.  Up to 10 miles north of the path of the tornado, large hail up to 4.5 inches in diameter fell.  Debris from the tornado was found as far away as southern Delaware.  Wind damage was also reported near the path of the storm.Across Charles County, 638 homes were damaged, 100 homes were destroyed, 143 businesses (mainly in downtown La Plata) were damaged, and 49 businesses were destroyed.  Countless trees and agricultural buildings were downed along the rural path of the storm.  Three people were killed and at least 120 people were injured countywide, 12 critically.  A 51-year-old man was killed and his wife was critically injured when their house under construction on Hawkins Gate Road, about 5 miles east of La Plata, collapsed.  A 54-year-old man died in his car from an apparent heart attack at the intersection of Route 301 and Route 6 in downtown La Plata.  The third victim, a 72-year-old woman, died of a heart attack in Waldorf after being frightened by the tornado.  The tornado first touched down on the eastern edge of General Smallwood State Park just north of Rison.  It pushed east-southeast and passed just south of Pisgah where it grew to F2 strength.  The tornado moved through Mount Pisgah and damaged homes on Ripley Road between Ripley and Garden Estates.  The twister continued to move east through rural lands south of Hawthorne Road (Route 255) passing just north of the community of Graystone.  Next, it moved through the communities of Habre de Venture, Longmeade, Clamber Hill, Hawthorne Manor, and Hillendale about 3 miles west of downtown La Plata.  The tornado, now F3 strength, hit the western portion of La Plata next, moving directly through the neighborhoods of Valley View, Morgan's Ridge, Quailwood, and Haldane.  The tornado, now F4 strength, continued east into the downtown area where it crossed through the intersection of Route 301 and 6.  Damage was found on either side of Route 6 with the most severe devastation occurring on the south side of the highway.  The downtown business district was nearly wiped out after 65% of the buildings were either heavily damaged or destroyed.  The 125-foot city water tower was also downed.  The tornado continued its trek southeast of the downtown hospital into the northern portion of Clarks Run, across Route 6, and into the community of Ellenwood.  The F4 tornado moved east of La Plata into the southern portion of Brynwood Farm Estates, then east across the Zekiah Swamp.  Several homes at the end of Hawkins Gate Road were completely destroyed, and this was the location of one fatality and numerous injuries.  Next, the tornado crossed Olivers Shop Road just north of the intersection of Route 231.  It continued east through rural lands until it intersected Route 5 at Homeland Drive just south of Hughesville.  East of Homeland Drive, it severely damaged the Girl Scout facility off Scout Camp Road.  The tornado tracked east-southeast toward Benedict, remaining just south of Route 231 and weakening to F2 strength.  It struck Colonial Lane and a home south of Benedict before crossing the river into Calvert County just south of the bridge.  In Calvert County, the tornado first struck the community of Patuxent View just south of Route 231 at F2 strength.  Over half of the homes in this development were damaged.  One home with no foundation or anchoring just east of Patuxent View off Hallowing Point Road was picked up and thrown 80 feet into a culvert.  A 68-year-old man and his 65-year-old wife who were taking shelter in the house were killed.  The twister continued eastward along Sixes Road to the intersection of Adelina Road.  Several homes and barns were damaged.  From there it pushed east through the communities of Boyds Farm, Mutual Estates, and Chippingwood, where it damaged more property.  It crossed Route 2/4 and 765 just north of St. Leonard, downing trees and it went.  Finally, it crossed the Western Shores Estates development at F1 strength before it moved offshore.  Another tornado formed on the Long Beach shoreline just north of Calvert Cliffs Power Plant.  It downed trees before moving offshore. This tornado grew in strength as it crossed the bay and struck Dorchester County on the eastern shore just south of Taylor's Island.  Across the county, 125 homes were damaged and 10 were destroyed, mainly in the Brownsville and Hallowing Point areas.  County officials collected over 300 tons of downed trees and storm debris.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A destructive tornado crossed the county from just north of Rison, through La Plata, to Benedict before moving into Calvert County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 114M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornadoes it produced left a 64 mile path of destruction ranging from F1 to F4 damage.  Five people were killed, 122 were injured, and over $115 million in damage was reported. The tornadoes were spawned from a supercell thunderstorm that crossed the Potomac River from Prince William County.  Up to 10 miles north of the path of the tornado, large hail up to 4.5 inches in diameter fell.  Debris from the tornado was found as far away as southern Delaware.  Wind damage was also reported near the path of the storm.Across Charles County, 638 homes were damaged, 100 homes were destroyed, 143 businesses (mainly in downtown La Plata) were damaged, and 49 businesses were destroyed.  Countless trees and agricultural buildings were downed along the rural path of the storm.  Three people were killed and at least 120 people were injured countywide, 12 critically.  A 51-year-old man was killed and his wife was critically injured when their house under construction on Hawkins Gate Road, about 5 miles east of La Plata, collapsed.  A 54-year-old man died in his car from an apparent heart attack at the intersection of Route 301 and Route 6 in downtown La Plata.  The third victim, a 72-year-old woman, died of a heart attack in Waldorf after being frightened by the tornado.  The tornado first touched down on the eastern edge of General Smallwood State Park just north of Rison.  It pushed east-southeast and passed just south of Pisgah where it grew to F2 strength.  The tornado moved through Mount Pisgah and damaged homes on Ripley Road between Ripley and Garden Estates.  The twister continued to move east through rural lands south of Hawthorne Road (Route 255) passing just north of the community of Graystone.  Next, it moved through the communities of Habre de Venture, Longmeade, Clamber Hill, Hawthorne Manor, and Hillendale about 3 miles west of downtown La Plata.  The tornado, now F3 strength, hit the western portion of La Plata next, moving directly through the neighborhoods of Valley View, Morgan's Ridge, Quailwood, and Haldane.  The tornado, now F4 strength, continued east into the downtown area where it crossed through the intersection of Route 301 and 6.  Damage was found on either side of Route 6 with the most severe devastation occurring on the south side of the highway.  The downtown business district was nearly wiped out after 65% of the buildings were either heavily damaged or destroyed.  The 125-foot city water tower was also downed.  The tornado continued its trek southeast of the downtown hospital into the northern portion of Clarks Run, across Route 6, and into the community of Ellenwood.  The F4 tornado moved east of La Plata into the southern portion of Brynwood Farm Estates, then east across the Zekiah Swamp.  Several homes at the end of Hawkins Gate Road were completely destroyed, and this was the location of one fatality and numerous injuries.  Next, the tornado crossed Olivers Shop Road just north of the intersection of Route 231.  It continued east through rural lands until it intersected Route 5 at Homeland Drive just south of Hughesville.  East of Homeland Drive, it severely damaged the Girl Scout facility off Scout Camp Road.  The tornado tracked east-southeast toward Benedict, remaining just south of Route 231 and weakening to F2 strength.  It struck Colonial Lane and a home south of Benedict before crossing the river into Calvert County just south of the bridge.

The tornadoes it produced left a 64 mile path of destruction ranging from F1 to F4 damage.  Five people were killed, 122 were injured, and over $115 million in damage was reported. The tornadoes were spawned from a supercell thunderstorm that crossed the Potomac River from Prince William County.  Up to 10 miles north of the path of the tornado, large hail up to 4.5 inches in diameter fell.  Debris from the tornado was found as far away as southern Delaware.  Wind damage was also reported near the path of the storm.Across Charles County, 638 homes were damaged, 100 homes were destroyed, 143 businesses (mainly in downtown La Plata) were damaged, and 49 businesses were destroyed.  Countless trees and agricultural buildings were downed along the rural path of the storm.  Three people were killed and at least 120 people were injured countywide, 12 critically.  A 51-year-old man was killed and his wife was critically injured when their house under construction on Hawkins Gate Road, about 5 miles east of La Plata, collapsed.  A 54-year-old man died in his car from an apparent heart attack at the intersection of Route 301 and Route 6 in downtown La Plata.  The third victim, a 72-year-old woman, died of a heart attack in Waldorf after being frightened by the tornado.  The tornado first touched down on the eastern edge of General Smallwood State Park just north of Rison.  It pushed east-southeast and passed just south of Pisgah where it grew to F2 strength.  The tornado moved through Mount Pisgah and damaged homes on Ripley Road between Ripley and Garden Estates.  The twister continued to move east through rural lands south of Hawthorne Road (Route 255) passing just north of the community of Graystone.  Next, it moved through the communities of Habre de Venture, Longmeade, Clamber Hill, Hawthorne Manor, and Hillendale about 3 miles west of downtown La Plata.  The tornado, now F3 strength, hit the western portion of La Plata next, moving directly through the neighborhoods of Valley View, Morgan's Ridge, Quailwood, and Haldane.  The tornado, now F4 strength, continued east into the downtown area where it crossed through the intersection of Route 301 and 6.  Damage was found on either side of Route 6 with the most severe devastation occurring on the south side of the highway.  The downtown business district was nearly wiped out after 65% of the buildings were either heavily damaged or destroyed.  The 125-foot city water tower was also downed.  The tornado continued its trek southeast of the downtown hospital into the northern portion of Clarks Run, across Route 6, and into the community of Ellenwood.  The F4 tornado moved east of La Plata into the southern portion of Brynwood Farm Estates, then east across the Zekiah Swamp.  Several homes at the end of Hawkins Gate Road were completely destroyed, and this was the location of one fatality and numerous injuries.  Next, the tornado crossed Olivers Shop Road just north of the intersection of Route 231.  It continued east through rural lands until it intersected Route 5 at Homeland Drive just south of Hughesville.  East of Homeland Drive, it severely damaged the Girl Scout facility off Scout Camp Road.  The tornado tracked east-southeast toward Benedict, remaining just south of Route 231 and weakening to F2 strength.  It struck Colonial Lane and a home south of Benedict before crossing the river into Calvert County just south of the bridge.  In Calvert County, the tornado first struck the community of Patuxent View just south of Route 231 at F2 strength.  Over half of the homes in this development were damaged.  One home with no foundation or anchoring just east of Patuxent View off Hallowing Point Road was picked up and thrown 80 feet into a culvert.  A 68-year-old man and his 65-year-old wife who were taking shelter in the house were killed.  The twister continued eastward along Sixes Road to the intersection of Adelina Road.  Several homes and barns were damaged.  From there it pushed east through the communities of Boyds Farm, Mutual Estates, and Chippingwood, where it damaged more property.  It crossed Route 2/4 and 765 just north of St. Leonard, downing trees and it went.  Finally, it crossed the Western Shores Estates development at F1 strength before it moved offshore.  Another tornado formed on the Long Beach shoreline just north of Calvert Cliffs Power Plant.  It downed trees before moving offshore. This tornado grew in strength as it crossed the bay and struck Dorchester County on the eastern shore just south of Taylor's Island.  Across the county, 125 homes were damaged and 10 were destroyed, mainly in the Brownsville and Hallowing Point areas.  County officials collected over 300 tons of downed trees and storm debris.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A strong tornado crossed the Patuxent River from Charles County and moved east through central Calvert County.

Wind damage was also reported near the path of the storm.Across Charles County, 638 homes were damaged, 100 homes were destroyed, 143 businesses (mainly in downtown La Plata) were damaged, and 49 businesses were destroyed.  Countless trees and agricultural buildings were downed along the rural path of the storm.  Three people were killed and at least 120 people were injured countywide, 12 critically.  A 51-year-old man was killed and his wife was critically injured when their house under construction on Hawkins Gate Road, about 5 miles east of La Plata, collapsed.  A 54-year-old man died in his car from an apparent heart attack at the intersection of Route 301 and Route 6 in downtown La Plata.  The third victim, a 72-year-old woman, died of a heart attack in Waldorf after being frightened by the tornado.  The tornado first touched down on the eastern edge of General Smallwood State Park just north of Rison.  It pushed east-southeast and passed just south of Pisgah where it grew to F2 strength.  The tornado moved through Mount Pisgah and damaged homes on Ripley Road between Ripley and Garden Estates.  The twister continued to move east through rural lands south of Hawthorne Road (Route 255) passing just north of the community of Graystone.  Next, it moved through the communities of Habre de Venture, Longmeade, Clamber Hill, Hawthorne Manor, and Hillendale about 3 miles west of downtown La Plata.  The tornado, now F3 strength, hit the western portion of La Plata next, moving directly through the neighborhoods of Valley View, Morgan's Ridge, Quailwood, and Haldane.  The tornado, now F4 strength, continued east into the downtown area where it crossed through the intersection of Route 301 and 6.  Damage was found on either side of Route 6 with the most severe devastation occurring on the south side of the highway.  The downtown business district was nearly wiped out after 65% of the buildings were either heavily damaged or destroyed.  The 125-foot city water tower was also downed.  The tornado continued its trek southeast of the downtown hospital into the northern portion of Clarks Run, across Route 6, and into the community of Ellenwood.  The F4 tornado moved east of La Plata into the southern portion of Brynwood Farm Estates, then east across the Zekiah Swamp.  Several homes at the end of Hawkins Gate Road were completely destroyed, and this was the location of one fatality and numerous injuries.  Next, the tornado crossed Olivers Shop Road just north of the intersection of Route 231.  It continued east through rural lands until it intersected Route 5 at Homeland Drive just south of Hughesville.  East of Homeland Drive, it severely damaged the Girl Scout facility off Scout Camp Road.  The tornado tracked east-southeast toward Benedict, remaining just south of Route 231 and weakening to F2 strength.  It struck Colonial Lane and a home south of Benedict before crossing the river into Calvert County just south of the bridge.  In Calvert County, the tornado first struck the community of Patuxent View just south of Route 231 at F2 strength.  Over half of the homes in this development were damaged.  One home with no foundation or anchoring just east of Patuxent View off Hallowing Point Road was picked up and thrown 80 feet into a culvert.  A 68-year-old man and his 65-year-old wife who were taking shelter in the house were killed.  The twister continued eastward along Sixes Road to the intersection of Adelina Road.  Several homes and barns were damaged.  From there it pushed east through the communities of Boyds Farm, Mutual Estates, and Chippingwood, where it damaged more property.  It crossed Route 2/4 and 765 just north of St. Leonard, downing trees and it went.  Finally, it crossed the Western Shores Estates development at F1 strength before it moved offshore.  Another tornado formed on the Long Beach shoreline just north of Calvert Cliffs Power Plant.  It downed trees before moving offshore. This tornado grew in strength as it crossed the bay and struck Dorchester County on the eastern shore just south of Taylor's Island.  Across the county, 125 homes were damaged and 10 were destroyed, mainly in the Brownsville and Hallowing Point areas.  County officials collected over 300 tons of downed trees and storm debris.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A strong tornado crossed the Patuxent River from Charles County and moved east through central Calvert County.

As the tornado passed over a ridge toward Beecher Hill Road, the most extensive damage occurred.  Along with major tree damage, two mobile homes were completely destroyed and a house suffered significant damage.  Five people were injured in one of the mobile homes, suffering many cuts and bruises.  Two elderly occupants of the other home also suffered minor injuries.  A piece of lumber went through the side of a home across the street.  The damage at this location was consistent with high end F1 tornado, with wind speeds estimated close to 110 mph.  The tornado continued east and crossed Lisle Road.  As the tornado came over another ridge toward Lisle Road, a gentleman in his barn witnessed the tornado with swirling debris coming over the ridge.  He was able to take shelter before many of the windows were blown out of his barn.  Significant tree damage could be seen, especially at the top of the ridge.  The tornado continued east, crossing Gaskill Road.  One property saw significant damage, with one barn destroyed and a shed from the property was torn apart.  Debris was blown as far as a quarter mile away.  Many large trees were uprooted with others twisted and broken off.  Significant tree damage was also seen at the top of the ridge west of the property with many trees broken or twisted off at mid-trunk.  Pieces of siding from a home were also found in this area.  At this point, it appears the tornado lifted briefly before touching down for the final time in the area where Ford Road, Foster Road, and Whittemore Hill Road meet.  The damage here consisted of another mobile home that was completely destroyed and significant tree damage.  There was also a significant amount of tree damage along the entire path of the tornado, with many trees uprooted and twisted off in different directions.  30 to 50 homes suffered minor damage in addition to 2 homes that saw more significant damage and the 3 mobile homes that were destroyed.  Many barns were also damaged and numerous sheds were destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 600K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the tornado passed over a ridge toward Beecher Hill Road, the most extensive damage occurred.  Along with major tree damage, two mobile homes were completely destroyed and a house suffered significant damage.  Five people were injured in one of the mobile homes, suffering many cuts and bruises.  Two elderly occupants of the other home also suffered minor injuries.  A piece of lumber went through the side of a home across the street.  The damage at this location was consistent with high end F1 tornado, with wind speeds estimated close to 110 mph.  The tornado continued east and crossed Lisle Road.  As the tornado came over another ridge toward Lisle Road, a gentleman in his barn witnessed the tornado with swirling debris coming over the ridge.  He was able to take shelter before many of the windows were blown out of his barn.  Significant tree damage could be seen, especially at the top of the ridge.  The tornado continued east, crossing Gaskill Road.  One property saw significant damage, with one barn destroyed and a shed from the property was torn apart.  Debris was blown as far as a quarter mile away.  Many large trees were uprooted with others twisted and broken off.  Significant tree damage was also seen at the top of the ridge west of the property with many trees broken or twisted off at mid-trunk.  Pieces of siding from a home were also found in this area.  At this point, it appears the tornado lifted briefly before touching down for the final time in the area where Ford Road, Foster Road, and Whittemore Hill Road meet.  The damage here consisted of another mobile home that was completely destroyed and significant tree damage.  There was also a significant amount of tree damage along the entire path of the tornado, with many trees uprooted and twisted off in different directions.  30 to 50 homes suffered minor damage in addition to 2 homes that saw more significant damage and the 3 mobile homes that were destroyed.  Many barns were also damaged and numerous sheds were destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 600K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado traveled from west to east and left a damage path that was 6.5 miles long and about a half mile wide. The storm traveled along 21 mile road passing about one mile north of the center of Tustin. The path of damage began about half a mile west of the intersection of 230th Avenue and 21 Mile Road. From there the tornado intensified and moved east. The worst damage occurred along 21 Mile Road between 220th and 200th Avenues. Numerous trees were snapped off or uprooted and several outbuildings and homes incurred roof damage from the high winds and falling trees. A garage attached to a house was destroyed and a camper was flipped over near the intersection of 21 Mile Road and 200th Avenue. The tornado continued east crossing U.S. 131 and ending between Makinaw trail and 170th Avenue, about two miles northeast of the center of Tustin. Numerous reports of downed trees and power lines were received from across most of southwestern and west central lower Michigan with severe thunderstorms through the late evening hours. One isolated report of three quarters inch hail was received from spotters in New Era (Oceana county).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The storm traveled along 21 mile road passing about one mile north of the center of Tustin. The path of damage began about half a mile west of the intersection of 230th Avenue and 21 Mile Road. From there the tornado intensified and moved east. The worst damage occurred along 21 Mile Road between 220th and 200th Avenues. Numerous trees were snapped off or uprooted and several outbuildings and homes incurred roof damage from the high winds and falling trees. A garage attached to a house was destroyed and a camper was flipped over near the intersection of 21 Mile Road and 200th Avenue. The tornado continued east crossing U.S. 131 and ending between Makinaw trail and 170th Avenue, about two miles northeast of the center of Tustin. Numerous reports of downed trees and power lines were received from across most of southwestern and west central lower Michigan with severe thunderstorms through the late evening hours. One isolated report of three quarters inch hail was received from spotters in New Era (Oceana county).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado moved east northeast and strengthened to F3 intesity as it crossed U.S. Highway 224 and moved into Tiffin.  The Honey Creek subdivision along County Road 19 near US 224 was hard hit.  Six homes on Nantucket Drive in the subdivision were destroyed and many other homes damaged.  As the tornado continued across the southern part of Tiffin it leveled a business along State Route 231 and destroyed several homes on Siesta Drive just east of State Route 231.  A retirement community along St. Francis Avenue and just north of Siesta Drive was also hard hit by the tornado.  Eight homes in the community were destroyed with five more damaged enough to be declared uninhabitable.  Another 25 homes sustained lesser amounts of damage and several cars were found lying upside down.  The tornado weakened to F2 intensity as it crossed State Route 100 and moved over Greenlawn Cemetary.  From the cemetary, the tornado began to move in more of a northeasterly direction and briefly weakened to F1 intensity as it passed to the east of Heidelburg College.  The tornado reintensified to F2 as it crossed State Route 18 and continued northeast across open country where it damaged many more homes and buildings.  The tornado reached strong F3 intensity for several miles to the northwest and north of Republic.  A 24 year old male was killed and two other people seriously injured when a home in Scipio Township on County Road 38 near County Road 43 was swept off of it's foundation.  Two other homes nearby were also leveled.  The tornado remained on the ground for another ten miles and gradually weakened to F2 intensity.  It finally lifted south of State Route 18 near Fireside.  Later, the same parent thunderstorm spawned another tornado a few miles away in Huron County.  Overall, this tornado destroyed 32 homes and businesses, heavily damaged another eight and slightly damaged around 70 homes in Seneca County.  Dozens of cars were also damaged and destroyed with downed trees and power poles numbering in the hundreds.  The damage path from this tornado was roughly 21 miles in length and over 200 yards in width at times.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 12.8M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Damage estimate for the tornadoes in Tennessee was placed at $160 million. Primary losses were due to houses and cars. The toll on government owned infrastructure is about $6 million. The federal government is expected to reimburse the state and affected counties for 75% of the costs of responding to the disaster.  The FEMA Public Assistance Program has obligated more than $3.6 million to assist local governments. These funds will be used to reimburse local governments for debris removal, the repair of public buildings and utilities, and overtime paid to police officers, firefighters and other emergency personnel.More than 900 families across the state  applied for storm aid. This was the worst tornado disaster since the April3-4 outbreak in 1974.

Damage estimate for the tornadoes in Tennessee was placed at $160 million. Primary losses were due to houses and cars. The toll on government owned infrastructure is about $6 million. The federal government is expected to reimburse the state and affected counties for 75% of the costs of responding to the disaster.  The FEMA Public Assistance Program has obligated more than $3.6 million to assist local governments. These funds will be used to reimburse local governments for debris removal, the repair of public buildings and utilities, and overtime paid to police officers, firefighters and other emergency personnel.More than 900 families across the state  applied for storm aid.

Their intensity was aided by a large cold pocket of air aloft combined with the strong June midday sunshine. As the storms approached the Hudson Valley of eastern New York, some of them became severe. Most of the reports were of hail damage. However, there two confirmed tornado touchdowns as well as one non-tornadic destructive wind report. The first of two tornados in eastern New York touched intermittenly down in the town of Florida, Montgomery County between Klapmeyer and Hartley Roads, to the southwest of Amsterdam. The path of this tornado varied between 50 and 100 yards and was approximately 3 miles long. Numerous trees were downed and there was minor damage to several houses as  well as one barns. The tornado vortex then lifted back off the ground but was still visible as a funnel cloud. The vortex touched down again briefly in the town of Amsterdam, near Mcquade Road. This second path was only a quarter mile long and about 50 yards wide. Approximately 10 trees were knocked down and minor damage was reported to two homes. The top wind gusts were estimated to be around 70 mph with this tornado. A  second twister, ranked as an F1 with top winds estimated around 100 mph, touched down near Pawling in Dutchess County, very close to the place a tornado had struck just two weeks before. The path of this tornado was 125 yards wide and a mile long. Damage was mostly confined to many downed and twisted trees. One tree did fall onto a garage thereby damaging it.  Thunderstorm winds blew two trees down on Ravena Road in the town of Coeyamns, Albany County. Golf ball size hail (1.75 inches in diameter)  was reported in Chatham while ping pong size hail (1.5 inches in diameter) was reported in the town of Stockport, Columbia County. One inch hail fell at Hopewell Junction, Dutchess County. There were additional reports of dime size hail in Schenectady, Rennselaer and Greene Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the severe storm rolled across Buffalo county, it moved southeast along Highway 40 through Amherst, near Riverdale and eventually into the city of Kearney.  In excess of 6000 structures will require roof, window, and siding repairs.  In some cases, hail stones penetrated the shingles, sheeting, and interior ceiling drywall.  One person reported an 8 inch diameter hole in their roof.  Another home owner sustained $60,000 in damage.  One more home owner reported hail stones landing on the living room couch, after falling through the roof.  Over 3000 automobiles were severely damaged. One local auto dealership experienced damage to 297 cars on the lot.  Hundreds of windows were lost on the campus of the University of Nebraska-Kearney.  Eight police cruisers were damaged.  Fifteen (15) people were treated for minor abrasions and released from the local hospital.  Several hailstones measured 5 inches in diameter throughout the county, and there were unconfirmed reports of melon sized hail near Amherst.In Kearney county, extensive damage was noted in the Minden area.  Four and a half (4.5) inch diameter hail was reported in the city.  The most extensive damage occurred at the indoor greenhouse facility which grows tomatoes.  The glass structure was no match for the softball size hailstones.  2500 pains of glass were broken, including about 60 percent of the roof panes.  Shards of glass penetrated the tomatoes and forced the expulsion of the product for safety reasons.  Crop damage was widespread throughout the county as over 22,000 acres of corn, soybeans and alfalfa were severely damaged or destroyed.  The storm continued south and produced more crop and property damage in parts of Webster and Franklin counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> All injuries were minor<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
