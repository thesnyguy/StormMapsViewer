The most intense wind damage was to the Ramada Inn on the northeast side of the I-270/Lindbergh Boulevard interchange.  It lost about half its roof with some of the debris landing on cars in the parking lot destroying them.  More of the debris landed over two tenths of a mile away, damaging or destroying a number of campers and RVs at an RV business with a number of vehicles having 2x4s driven into them.  Another nearby hotel sustained moderate roof damage as well.  Otherwise, most of the wind damage consisted of trees blown over, numerous large tree limbs blown down, as well as power lines being blown down.

However, an unsecured inflatable castle broke loose at the Farley Nuclear Plant during the storm, and one man was killed when a metal pipe from the structure hit him on the head.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 49 year old male was killed when an inflatable that looked like a castle came loose from its moorings during at thunderstorm and a pipe struck him in the head.  There was no other damage reported in the immediate vicinity, so it was likely that this was associated with sub-severe wind speeds.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A squall line developed across southeast Arkansas and moved quickly across north-central Mississippi during the morning, producing multiple reports of damaging winds and ping-pong to golf ball size hail. There were reports of multiple trees blown down, some roofs blown off buildings and wind gusts of 60-80 mph, with a 77 mph wind gust measured at the Columbus AFB surface observing station. A lone supercell moved across southeast Arkansas just after 1:00 pm and showed many indications of very large hail and strong rotation. This storm gradually began making more of a right turn and continued to dive southeast across northeast Louisiana before moving into Mississippi. This storm produced multiple reports of golf ball to baseball size hail as it continued to dive southeast, shattering windows in homes and vehicles. This storm gradually weakened as another storm began to develop just to the southwest over Morehouse Parish. The storm continued to move southeast with the southern edge of the storm beginning to develop supercell characteristics. This storm became the focus of activity as it began rapidly increasing in intensity and showing signs of producing large hail. Ping pong to tennis ball size hail fell as the storm moved into northern Warren County, breaking numerous windows on vehicles near Redwood. Strong winds blew a tree on a house and caused a minor injury near Redwood. The long-lived supercell continued to move into a favorable environment and produced multiple reports of golf ball to baseball size hail along its path as it moved into the Jackson metro area. The largest hailstone was softball size, or 4.25 inches, which fell in Clinton around 3:50 pm, shattering vehicle windshields. One injury occurred in the Pinehaven community near Clinton when a baseball size hailstone fell onto a resident causing head trauma. This supercell continued to move southeast over the downtown Jackson metro area with numerous reports of golf ball to baseball size hail falling all along the path. The large hail from this supercell caused major roof damage, shattered windshields and caused dents in numerous vehicles and siding damage to multiple mobile homes in the Jackson metro area. The squall line in northeastern Mississippi produced an outflow boundary that moved to the south and southeast which would serve as a focus for additional thunderstorm development ahead of the storm moving into western Mississippi. Thunderstorms began increasing in intensity along the outflow boundary and numerous reports of large hail continued in a swath down into southern Mississippi. Reports of golf ball to baseball size hail were received along a line from Seminary to Natchez and a few golf ball size hailstones fell south of Columbia. As the actual cold front finally made its way through the I-20 corridor and south, additional hail fell during the evening. However, this hail was significantly smaller than what fell earlier, with sizes ranging from nickel to quarter size. The thunderstorms gradually moved out of the Pine Belt region late on the evening of the 18th.||An elementary school in Clinton was damaged bad enough to have to close for the remainder of the school year, and many state and local law enforcement vehicles were heavily damaged or totaled. The amount of damages to the Jackson metro area were staggering and will be remembered for years to come.

There were several rounds of convection.  The first developed over northern Iowa during the mid afternoon hours and moved north into Minnesota.  A break in the thunderstorm activity took place before the next round moved into southwest Iowa and spread north and east during the evening.  The atmosphere became unstable with highs in the 80s and dewpoints in the low to mid 60s by afternoon.  CAPE, though not excessive, was sufficient with 1000 to 3000 J/kg available.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 300 and 600 J/kg.  In the late afternoon hours around 500 J/kg of downdraft CAPE was present, and it increased to around 900 to 1100 J/kg during the evening hours. The shear increased as well with 25 to 40 kts available at the beginning of the event, and 50 to 60 kts by the end.  Precipitable water values increased to 1.2 to 1.5 inches.  The LCL was relatively low, around 1000 meters.  The freezing level was relatively low, around 11,900 feet.  The storms produced heavy rain and large hail initially.  Flash flooding occurred first in Crawford County in western Iowa with over two inches of rainfall in about an hour, causing water to flow over Highway 141.  The event became a wind and hail event for the most part with winds gusting to 60 to 80 MPH across a large part of the CWA and hail up to 3 inches in diameter in Adams County.  The largest hail was northwest of Carbon in Adams County, where 2 to 3 inch diameter hail fell.  Reports indicated enough hail fell to completely cover the ground. Numerous reports of 1.5 inch hail were received.  Three tornadoes touched down in central Iowa. Numerous reports of winds of 60 to 80 MPH were received all along the line of thunderstorms.  High winds blew a semi truck off the highway and blew it over west of Earlham in Madison County.

These heavy rains, augmented by a December record 1.7 inches of precipitable water, developed along a stationary front that lay along but just north of the Ohio River from Cairo, IL to Cincinnati. These early rains, combined with thunderstorms during the afternoon and early evening, brought areal and river flooding to north central Kentucky. ||By early afternoon, low pressure deepened as it moved northeast across central Illinois and northern Indiana. Rains ceased by mid-day as central Kentucky fell within the warm sector of the developing cyclone. Record high temperatures in the lower 70s arrived by early evening.  A severe squall line developed by mid-afternoon from southern Illinois southwards along the Mississippi River. This line of storms, fueled by ample moisture and an exceptionally strong low level jet in excess of 50 kts, became severe as it moved across southern Indiana and central Kentucky during the evening hours. Three circulations within this line produced tornadoes across central Kentucky and the Bluegrass Region. For the Louisville weather office, these 3 December tornadoes were the first observed since 1971.

A stationary front remained in place from central Nebraska into northern Missouri.  The front aloft remained over Iowa, setting the stage for repeated thunderstorm development.  The parameters changed little from the previous event.  A weakly sheared atmosphere was in place with 25 to 30 kts of shear available.  CAPE values were slightly higher, in the 1000 to 2000 J/kg range.  Downdraft CAPE ranged from under 400 J/kg over the east part of the CWA to 800 J/kg over the west.  A substantial inversion was in place over most of the Des Moines CWA.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was relatively low, only 200 to 400 J/kg.  Precipitable water values were in the 1.3 to 1.6 inch range, or over 2 standard deviations above normal.  Thunderstorms from the previous night weakened, only to be replaced by a new round of thunderstorms that developed over northwest Iowa by mid day on the 26th.  These storms moved southeast across the state, producing heavy rain across many of the areas that received heavy rainfall the night before.  Highway closings were too numerous to mention with many small creeks overflowing their banks and causing flash flooding.  There were several reports of road washouts and bridges being washed out.  A man driving a SUV was swept away by swift flood waters Monday morning on Westbrook Street in Butler County west of Parkersburg.  Severe weather was limited.  The storms produced half dollar size hail in Taylor County.  Hail also fell in Humboldt and Polk Counties.  A funnel cloud was reported in Taylor County as well.  One brief tornado touchdown was reported southwest Diagonal in Ringgold County.  On the morning of the 27th, as the second MCS decayed, high winds occurred over a small part of north central into central Iowa as a wake low formed.  Winds gusted to 58 MPH in Polk County at Ankeny.  An RWIS site in Marshall County at Marshalltown recorded a 60 MPH wind gust.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County and Hardin Counties.

In addition, a weak stationary front stretched along the Front Range Foothills and Palmer Divide.  As a result, a prolonged period of moderate to heavy rain developed across the Front Range Foothills, Palmer Divide, Urban Corridor.  By the 14th, storm totals ranged from 6 to 18 inches, highest in the foothills of Boulder County.  The headwaters then moved down the South Platte River and caused widespread flooding with record flood stages at several locations as it made its way downstream into Nebraska.  Record high flood stages along the South Platte River were recorded at Balzac, Weldona and Julesburg.  As a result, widespread flooding occur along the South Platte for several days as the headwaters continued downstream, with much of the damage reported from Fort Morgan and Brush to around Sterling.  The floodwaters resulted in widespread evacuations.  Numerous water treatment facilities were contaminated and had to be shut down.  The headwaters remained at or above flood stage east of Sterling to Julesburg, but the flooding was not as widespread and the damage not as extensive. ||Initially, the showers that developed on the afternoon of the 11th were moving fast enough and were small enough to produce generally moderate rainfall amounts.   However, rain along the Front Range began to intensify and become more widespread in the evening. A narrow band of very heavy rain began to organize just north of Denver and move westward toward the foothills.  By 9 pm mdt on the 11th, heavy rain was becoming more widespread, with rainfall rates near 2 inches per hour in the heaviest showers.  From 10 pm mdt to Midnight mdt, very heavy rain locked itself in against the Front Range.  Flash flooding became more widespread, with several road closures from northwest Jefferson County northward through Boulder and Larimer Counties.  The heaviest rain in the foothills of Boulder, Larimer and northern Jefferson Counties finally began to abate, but widespread flash flooding continued due to the extremely heavy rainfall during the evening and early morning hours of the 12th.  Meanwhile, torrential rain redeveloped in southwest Weld, northeast Adams, eastern Denver and northwest Arapahoe Counties in the early morning hours of the 12th;  which impacted northeast Denver and Aurora.  ||Atypical for September in Colorado, 24-hour rainfall totals ending 7 am mdt on September 12th included 6.5 to 8.6 inches in Boulder; with 3 to 6.5 inches across the Larimer and Boulder County foothills, as well an area stretching from northeastern Metro Denver area into southwest Weld County.  By 9 am mdt, heavy rain and considerable flash flooding continued through the morning in the Aurora area.   Numerous streams remained at or above bankfull levels across Boulder, Larimer, and southwest Weld counties.  By the evening of the 12th, flooding continued in many areas and increased in severity. Heavy rain, while not as widespread as the previous day, had a greater impact on stream levels as streams were already elevated and the ground was completely saturated. Two peaks of flows occurred on Boulder Creek near downtown. The peak flow on the evening of September 12th surpassed the 1969 Boulder flood, but initial indications are that it fell short of the 1938 and 1894 floods.  Boulder Stream Gauge ���peak flows occurred near 0100 mdt on the 12th, and 2100 mdt on the 12th.   Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Big Thompson River,  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  The headwaters moved down the South Platte with floodwaters impacted Weld, Morgan, Washington and Logan Counties.  Extensive flooding occurred in and around Greeley, Fort Morgan and Sterling.  Large sections of the counties' roads and highways were washed away, with property and crops completely inundated.   ||After little rainfall on Friday, September 13th, the flash flood threat returned for  Saturday. This time, storms with heavy rainfall were concentrated in Douglas County, but also extended northeast into the Aurora area once again. Up to 3 inches of rain fell in one hour.  Plum Creek and other small creeks and streams flooded, along with significant street flooding.  The last day of this prolonged period of very heavy rainfall was on Sunday, September 15th. Another weak front had pushed through the area Saturday night, leaving the atmosphere unseasonably moist and unstable.  Heavy rain developed by mid morning and then became more widespread and peaked in intensity by the noon hour. This time, flash flooding was most significant in the northern portions of the Denver metro area from Northglenn to around Broomfield. Rain finally tapered off during the late afternoon and evening.||The devastating flood damage encompassed 4,500 square miles of the Colorado Front Range, left seven dead, forced thousands to evacuate, and destroyed thousands of homes and farms. Record amounts of rainfall generated flash floods that tore up roads and lines of communication, leaving many stranded.  Nearly 19,000 homes were damaged, and over 1,500 destroyed.  The Colorado Department of Transportation estimated that at least 30 state highway bridges were destroyed and an additional 20 seriously damaged. A preliminary assessment of the state's infrastructure showed damage of $40 million to roads and $112 million to bridges.  Repair costs for state and and county roads were likely to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Miles of freight and passenger rail lines were washed out or submerged, including a section servicing Amtrak's iconic California Zephyr.  The town of Lyons in Boulder County was isolated by the flooding of St. Vrain Creek, and several earth dams along the Front Range burst or were over-topped.   Floodwaters also swept through Estes Park, the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park and a major tourist attraction, and damaged hundreds of buildings and destroyed large sections of the two main roads that led into town; U.S. 34 from Loveland and U.S. 36 from Lyons/Boulder.  U.S. 34 suffered the most damage, with 85 percent of its roadway and bridges destroyed.   In Weld County, approximately 1,900 gas wells were damaged and had to be closed off as the floodwaters inundated entire communities. ||Sewage treatment plants and other utilities were knocked out in a number of towns,  and standing water left by floods on prairie farmlands posed the threat of significant damage to crops already planted in the region.  Northeast Colorado Health Department has advised with the local CSU Extension office in Logan County regarding local crops and gardens that had been exposed to flood waters.  As the flood waters in our area should be considered contaminated, local crops and gardens may not be considered suitable for human consumption or animal feed.  In the flooded areas, an estimated 23,000 acres of cropland was impacted and stretched from Boulder to Logan Counties and included:  alfalfa, corn, hay, silage and sugar beets.  The estimated loss of production ranged from $3.4 million to $5.5 million. ||Governor Hickenlooper declared a disaster emergency on September 13th, in 11 counties across northeast Colorado including:  Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Boulder, Denver, Jefferson, Larimer, Logan, Morgan, Washington and Weld.  By September 15th, federal emergency declarations covered those counties as well as Clear Creek County.  Projected losses from the flooding statewide was nearly $3 billion in property damage.  Half of the damage estimate was from housing and half from the commercial and government sectors, according to Eqecat, a catastrophe modeling firm; this was the first comprehensive estimate of the disaster's economic toll.  The projected losses for residential property alone were about $900 million.  Another $1 billion was attributed to commercial and goverment property, including roads and bridges.  In addition, more than 11 thousand people were evacuated, reportedly the largest since Hurricane Katrina.  President Obama declared a state of emergency for Boulder and Larimer Counties, with an additional 10 counties added September 16th including: Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Clear Creek, Denver, Jefferson, Morgan, Logan, Washington and Weld Counties.

The warm air and strong winds aloft supported the growth of strong damaging storms and heavy rain. Most of the region measured between two to four inches of precipitation. The recently melted snow pack combined with runoff from the moderate to heavy rain that weekend resulted in widespread flooding with all rivers experiencing minor to major flooding.  A warm front lifted north across the area during the evening hours.  Strong to severe thunderstorms developed during the late evening hours of the 21st.

Rainfall amounts varied from three quarters of an inch in northwestern Indiana to one and one half to almost three inches along and east of Interstate 69 and south of U.S. 30.  Ground conditions were frozen at the time with a frost depth of several inches. T his allowed for all the precipitation to rapidly run off to streams, creeks and rivers and cause rises in water levels and low land flooding. Several roads were closed in the area of concern, with many that are typically impacted during river flooding or other high water events.  A 19 year old male lost his life as a result of driving into flood waters where his vehicle flipped, filling the passenger compartment.  A rapid response in personnel occurred, but by the time he was reached and the vehicle secured he was non responsive and later pronounced dead at a local hospital.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Local media reported that a 19 year old male lost control of his vehicle on State road 26, east of Fairmount, Indiana after encountering high water from a nearby stream that had flowed over the road. The vehicle flipped and the passenger compartment became submerged.  A passing motorist contacted 911 and when responders arrived only one foot of the vehicle was visible.  Deputies waded 30 to 40 feet off the road into roughly 3 feet of water and attached tow lines and subsequently pulled the vehicle out.  The male was found unresponsive in the vehicle and was later pronounced dead at a local hospital.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado then began moving northeast towards New Minden.  The worst damage was about 2 miles west southwest of New Minden, where a small farm sustained a direct hit.  The outbuildings and barns sustained varying degrees of damage, but the homestead was totally destroyed with only the foundation remaining.  The damage at the homestead was rated EF4, and two fatalities occurred at this location.  Also, a large full size van was rolled over.  Less than a quarter of a mile east of the house, a single wide mobile home was destroyed.  There were 4 people at this location, three of them sought shelter in the creek bed just east of the mobile home while one went back to mobile home to retrieve something.  This person rode out the tornado in the bathtub, but was thrown about 50 feet into a field.  One of his ankles was broken.  He was treated and released from a local hospital.  The tornado then continued to race northeast, hitting the far north side of New Minden north of Illinois Route 177, and producing significant damage to St. Johns Lutheran Church and to several homes just northwest of the church.  Damage to two of the homes was rated EF3.  The tornado continued northeast, producing sporadic damage to just north of Hoyleton. A farm 2 miles west-northwest of Hoyleton sustained significant damage, as did a newly constructed home 2 miles north of Hoyleton.  Damage at these two locations were rated EF2.  The tornado then veered a bit northwest and dissipated.  Overall, the entire tornado path length was 10.59 miles with a max path width of 200 yards. The tornado was rated EF4 with max wind speeds of at least 166 MPH.  There were two fatalities and 2 minor injuries.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the system approached central Illinois, unseasonably warm and humid air was pulled northward into the area, resulting in high temperatures soaring into the 70s. This very unstable airmass coupled with strong jet stream level winds aloft created numerous strong to severe thunderstorms. Many of the storms became supercells, producing damaging long-track tornadoes.  A total of 10 tornadoes touched down across central Illinois, including an EF4 tornado that severely impacted the community of Washington in Tazewell County.  Three people were killed and 142 others were injured as the storms tracked through the area.  Total damage was estimated at 1.06 billion dollars across central Illinois.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado touched down in an open field 2.8 miles NE of Allerton at 1:03 PM CST.  The tornado tracked to the northeast for about 15 miles and did major damage to 2 homes, roof damage to 4 other homes, and destroyed 9 outbuildings, 4 garages, and 2 grain bins.  Numerous trees and power poles were also snapped.  The tornado crossed State Route 1 about 2 miles north of Westville, impacting the villages of Belgium and Hegeler where 1 person was injured.  Nine homes sustained major damage, 26 had significant roof damage, and more than 100 had minor roof damage.  The tornado also damaged more than 50 mobile homes, numerous garages and vehicles, and destroyed about 25 outbuildings.  The tornado crossed the Vermilion River and moved through about a mile of forested area before dissipating 4.4 miles NE of Westville and 3 miles W of the Indiana border.

The event lasted well into the overnight hours.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> On 31 May, an intense, long-track tornado formed southwest of El Reno. This exceptionally wide tornado took a complex path, rapidly changing in both speed and direction. The tornado spared El Reno and its airport from a direct hit, tracking just south of those locations. The tornado damaged numerous homes along with a few businesses near El Reno.  Additionally, intense sub-vortices destroyed crops in numerous fields in the area.||The tornado developed at 6:03 p.m. just northeast of the intersection of Heaston and Reuter roads.  Initially, the tornado moved to the southeast at 20 to 25 mph.  At 6:09 p.m., the tornado turned to the east, just south of Reno Road between Heaston and Brandley roads.  The tornado continued to expand in size just southwest of the El Reno Municipal Air Park, where its speed increased to 30 to 40 mph.  As the tornado passed just south of the airport, two satellite tornadoes formed briefly on the west side of the tornado.||At 6:19 p.m. the tornado crossed Highway 81 near Reno Road as it continued to expand in size.  There, the tornado abruptly turned to the north, while also accelerating to greater than 50 mph.   From 6:24 to 6:26 p.m., the tornado reached its maximum in size and intensity near the intersection of Radio and Reuter roads.  The tornado, still very large, slowed down as it approached I-40.  From 6:27 to 6:35 the tornado made a loop just north of the interstate while decelerating to less than 10 mph.  After 6:35, the tornado moved east once again, and dissipated at 6:42 p.m. near the intersection of I-40 and Banner Road.| |Eight people were killed in the tornado, all in vehicles. This included three severe storm researchers who were killed east of US-81 as the tornado overtook their position. Additionally, several other people were killed while attempting to escape the tornado near Highway 81.  Finally, two people were killed along I-40 while waiting for the storm to pass.||The monetary damages were estimated.  This tornado was well sampled by two separate mobile research radar teams ��� the University of Oklahoma RaXPol radar, and the Center for Severe Weather Research���s Doppler on Wheels. Both radars captured high temporal and spatial resolution data relatively close to the large tornado. Both radars measured winds in the tornado of more than 200 mph. The RaXPol radar data shows winds of at least 295 mph very close to the surface. These intense winds were present in very small sub-vortices within the larger tornado circulation. An analysis of the high resolution radar data combined with the results of the ground damage survey indicates that none of these intense sub-vortices impacted any structures in rural Canadian County. So despite the measured wind speeds, surveyors could not find any damage that would support a rating higher than EF3 based solely on the damage indicators used with the EF scale. ||The maximum tornado width was 2.6 miles.  However, the damaging wind swath was much larger, as non-tornadic downdraft winds extended for at least a mile south of the tornado.

Very strong wind fields coupled with moderate amounts of instability resulted in several supercell thunderstorms, some of which produced tornadoes. The storms moved through the warm sector of a low pressure system characterized by mixed-layer capes around 1000 j/kg. Southerly surface winds transported rich low-level moisture north of the Ohio River, with dew points in the mid 60's. Areas of partial sunshine immediately preceding the convection bolstered instability. The low level wind shear was very strong, with 0 to 1 km storm-relative helicity at or above 500. Strong southerly surface winds ahead of the storms gusted to around 45 mph from Mount Vernon to Carbondale during the midday hours.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado crossed the Ohio River from McCracken County, Kentucky into Massac County, Illinois. Video of the tornado taken by a barge operator as it crossed the Ohio River indicated it was completely rain-wrapped. This long-track tornado attained its peak intensity as it came onshore into Brookport, a small community along the Ohio River. Peak winds here were estimated near 145 mph. About a half dozen mobile homes were obliterated. Dozens of mobile homes were destroyed, many of which were blown 100 feet or more. Three mobile home residents were killed. A 62-year-old woman died at a local hospital within hours of sustaining blunt force trauma injuries in the tornado. A 58-year-old woman died at her residence as a result of blunt force trauma injuries. A 56-year-old man also died of blunt force trauma injuries sustained at his residence. An exact injury count was unavailable, but local hospitals reported over two dozen injuries. The Metropolis hospital reported 15 victims were brought to the emergency room, with no patient admissions. Three patients were transferred to other hospitals by air or ambulance. Injuries ranged from cuts and scrapes to broken bones and head injuries. One home was leveled. Dozens of homes, garages, storage buildings, businesses, and other buildings were structurally damaged. Emergency management officials reported 233 residences were affected from Brookport east to the Pope County line. 130 of those homes were habitable with minor to moderate damage, 27 were uninhabitable, and 76 homes were destroyed. 184 were located in the city of Brookport, and 49 were outside the city limits. Several cars and a school bus were tossed around. Hundreds if not thousands of trees were snapped and uprooted. The tornado caused some minor damage to guard rails on the Ohio River bridge that carries traffic from Paducah to Brookport on U.S. Highway 45. The tornado continued east along Unionville Road, eventually crossing into Pope County. The total path length of this tornado was 42 miles. The parent supercell tracked from southeast Missouri across the Mississippi River through the Paducah area, then east to the Kentucky Lake area of western Kentucky.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

About a half dozen mobile homes were obliterated. Dozens of mobile homes were destroyed, many of which were blown 100 feet or more. Three mobile home residents were killed. A 62-year-old woman died at a local hospital within hours of sustaining blunt force trauma injuries in the tornado. A 58-year-old woman died at her residence as a result of blunt force trauma injuries. A 56-year-old man also died of blunt force trauma injuries sustained at his residence. An exact injury count was unavailable, but local hospitals reported over two dozen injuries. The Metropolis hospital reported 15 victims were brought to the emergency room, with no patient admissions. Three patients were transferred to other hospitals by air or ambulance. Injuries ranged from cuts and scrapes to broken bones and head injuries. One home was leveled. Dozens of homes, garages, storage buildings, businesses, and other buildings were structurally damaged. Emergency management officials reported 233 residences were affected from Brookport east to the Pope County line. 130 of those homes were habitable with minor to moderate damage, 27 were uninhabitable, and 76 homes were destroyed. 184 were located in the city of Brookport, and 49 were outside the city limits. Several cars and a school bus were tossed around. Hundreds if not thousands of trees were snapped and uprooted. The tornado caused some minor damage to guard rails on the Ohio River bridge that carries traffic from Paducah to Brookport on U.S. Highway 45. The tornado continued east along Unionville Road, eventually crossing into Pope County. The total path length of this tornado was 42 miles. The parent supercell tracked from southeast Missouri across the Mississippi River through the Paducah area, then east to the Kentucky Lake area of western Kentucky.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Very unstable air ahead of the cold front, combined with strong wind shear, resulted in storms quickly evolving into supercells.

In Nowata County, this tornado destroyed a mobile home, injuring two occupants. It also damaged other permanent homes, destroyed a barn, and snapped or uprooted numerous trees. Based on this damage, maximum estimated wind in this segment of the tornado was 100 to 110 mph. Several storm chasers photographed this tornado.

The first and most intense thunderstorm of the day developed over northern Phillips county just after 4:30 pm CDT. This was the southern storm in a line segment of supercell storms, which exhibited multicell characteristics. This line extended northeast across the border into southern Nebraska. During the following four hours, this storm tracked east across Phillips, Smith and Jewell counties. Numerous storm chasers followed this storm. The initial storm report came from the rear flank of the storm, over Phillips county. It was here that the RFD produced winds estimated around 60 mph. As the storm moved east, two weak, brief tornadoes were spotted just northwest and northeast of Smith Center. A rain-wrapped EF-3 tornado, described as a wedge, then followed, tracking just north of Lebanon and Esbon. The tornado track was roughly 6 miles long and at its widest point, was nearly one mile wide. Even though this tornado was over rural areas, it still managed to produce damage. The worst damage was to a home that lost its roof and part of its second story. ||On radar, the hook echo was short and stubby. Because of this, there was substantial rain within the mesocyclone, which made it difficult to see the tornado except in its immediate vicinity. The Tornado Intercept Vehicle endured a direct hit from the tornado, with video confirmation. As this storm continued into Jewell County, no more reports of wind damage or tornadoes were received. However, the hail dramatically increased with multiple reports of hail to the size of tennis balls. The largest hail was yet to occur. Near Montrose, hail a little large than grapefruit size was reported (5 and 1/4 inches). After 7:00 pm CDT, other multicell storms developed, mainly affecting Mitchell county. These storms only produced a single report of 1 inch hail northwest of Beloit.||With the 8 am CDT Severe Weather Outlook, the Storm Prediction Center upgraded North Central Kansas to a moderate risk for severe thunderstorms. A weak short-wave trough was approaching the region, embedded within a broad upper-level trough, over the western United States. A quasi-stationary front, oriented in an east-west fashion, extended across Nebraska. During the early morning hours, a mesoscale convective system tracked through eastern Nebraska southeastward into Missouri. This MCS laid down an outflow boundary that extended across northern Kansas, to a lee-side low. It was to the north of this outflow boundary that storms initiated. At the time of initial thunderstorm development, temperatures were in the lower to middle 80s to near 90, with dewpoints in the middle 60s. This resulted in an extremely unstable atmosphere, with MLCAPE between 3000 and 4000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was 40 to 50 knots, which was more that strong enough for supercell storm structures.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado affected two counties in north central Kansas, touching down north of Lebanon in Smith County and lifting north of Esbon in Jewell County.  The maximum wind speed was estimated to be near 140 MPH, with a maximum path width of 1580 yards.  Along its path, this tornado caused minor to major tree damage, overturned irrigation pivots, snapped power poles and damaged or destroyed grain bins and outbuildings.  Four homesteads suffered damage, with the hardest hit locations approximately 3 miles northeast of Lebanon in Smith County.  Two homes in this area were heavily damaged or destroyed, with one losing its entire second level.  This location also completely lost grain bins, a large outbuilding and newly constructed garage.

It downed trees, blew over empty tractor trailers, and caused minor damage to construction equipment. It moved east-northeast into Weldon Spring Heights and the Missouri Research Park (on the south side of Weldon Spring) causing roof, window, and solar panel damage to a few structures as well as downing more trees before crossing Interstate 64. The tornado passed within one half of a mile of the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office which is located in the Missouri Research Park. The tornado continued moving east-northeast through densely populated residential areas of southern St. Charles County, south of Highway 94. Roofing was torn off of Bryan Middle School and blown 100 yards, many houses suffered varying degrees of roof (from minor damage to removal of entire roof), wall (from minor damage to total collapse), and overall structural damage, and thousands of trees were damaged. The most intense damage, rated EF3, occurred on Haversham Drive where only the interior walls were left standing of three homes. The tornado began to move a bit more easterly, widening to nearly 1000 yards (or a half-mile), causing damage in residential areas and the St. Charles Family Arena before crossing the Missouri River into St. Louis County just south of Interstate 70.||The tornado caused damage to 765 homes in St. Charles County.  Seven hundred twenty-three homes suffered minor damage, 34 homes suffered major damage, and 8 homes were destroyed. Three hundred forty-eight businesses sustained minor damage, while 25 businesses had major damage. Cleanup costs alone for St. Charles County was 2.4 million dollars, with approximately 50,000 tons of tree and limb debris removed.  There were 8 minor injuries due to the tornado.||The path length of the tornado in St. Charles County was 14.8 miles with a max path width of 950 yards.  The damage for this segment was estimated to be EF3 with max wind speeds of 150 MPH.  Overall, the entire tornado path length was 31.8 miles with a max path width of 1 mile and a maximum damage rating of EF3.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system contained unusually strong winds aloft, with wind speeds of 80 mph just 2500 feet above the surface and up to 150 mph at 20,000 feet. A record warm airmass with temperatures in the 60s and 70s spread northward ahead of the system into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, bringing weak atmospheric instability into the region. As a powerful cold front moved eastward across Middle Tennessee during the early morning hours of January 30, the strong low level jet ahead of the front caused strong gradient winds of 40 to 65 mph at the surface, resulting in several reports of wind damage. A peak sustained south wind of 45 mph with a peak gust of 64 mph was measured by the ASOS at the Nashville International Airport around 315 AM CST in association with these intense gradient winds. A line of showers and thunderstorms known as a Quasi-Linear Convective System (QLCS) developed along the front near the Tennessee River and raced eastward through the area between 2 AM and 6 AM, producing at least 23 tornadoes and widespread wind damage. This severe weather event resulted in 1 fatality and at least 3 injuries across the Mid State. The total of 23 tornadoes made the January 30, 2013 event the largest January tornado outbreak in Middle Tennessee history.  It also made January 30, 2013 the second biggest outbreak of tornadoes for any month in Middle Tennessee history.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF0 tornado touched down just northeast of the I-65 and Trinity Lane interchange and moved eastward along a narrow intermittent path through East Nashville before ending around McGavock Pike in Inglewood just to the west of the Cumberland River.  Several mobile homes were heavily damaged by falling trees along Dickerson Pike, with one woman receiving a minor injury in the Ranchwood Mobile Home Park. Numerous homes had minor roof and exterior damage along Donald Street, Gordon Terrace, Woodyhill Drive, and Jones Avenue, and several large trees were blown down. Some roof damage was noted to health department buildings on RS Gass drive south of Hart Lane. Dozens of more homes suffered minor roof and exterior damage from the Gillock Street and Gallatin Pike area eastward to near McGavock Pike, with numerous trees and fences blown down.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A skating rink in this location suffered EF-1 roof damage.  The tornado moved northeast causing sporadic EF-0 and EF-1 tree damage for about 3 miles crossing Highway 370 in the process. The tornado intensified to EF-2 strength in Hazelwood near Woodcrest Lane where the roof was torn off a home.  The tornado was also at its maximum width at this location reaching 500 yards wide.  Along Teson Road, north of Howdershell Road, 10 apartment buildings were damaged with 5 buildings losing portions of their roofs.  The tornado then turned a bit to the east and caused EF-2 damage at Lynn Haven Lane and Howdershell Road.  Two homes at this location lost most of their roofs. Also, across the street on the north side of Howdershell Road a strip mall had small portions of the roof removed, as well as glass windows and doors shattered.  Tree damage, EF-0 to EF-1 strength, occurred along Lamplight Lane, Coach Light Lane, Caposele Lane, and Gerardini Drive.  Several homes on these streets suffered roof damage from falling trees and large tree limbs.  The area from Lynn Haven Lane to Gerardini Drive had the highest concentration of damage.  As the tornado moved east northeast into Florissant sporadic EF-0 to EF-1 tree damage occurred to just east of St. Ferdinand Park along Beverly Drive.  Also, just south of St. Ferdinand Park, another strip mall at the intersection of Lindbergh Boulevard and St. Jean Street sustained minor roof damage. The tornado moved very fast, covering 6.75 miles in about 5 minutes.  Sporadic thunderstorm wind gust damage, mainly tress uprooted or large limbs downed, was noted north and south of the tornado track.  Several business signs were also damaged along Lindbergh Blvd. in Florissant.  Two people sustained minor injuries.  One had a broken leg and another just had some scrapes and bruises.  Almost 400 structures sustained some kind of damage.  Fifty five of these structures were either destroyed or sustained significant damage.  The tornado was rated EF-2 overall. The maximum path width was 500 yards and the path length was 6.75 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

During the morning hours of February 10th, a line of severe thunderstorms moved into the ArkLaMiss, downing trees and powerlines over portions of southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana, and central Mississippi. There was also a barn destroyed near Silver City in Humphreys County. The storms continued to push eastward through the early afternoon, then began to slow down as the cold front began to stall. To the south and east of this line of storms, several supercell thunderstorms developed in the more unstable air mass over south Mississippi, with many of the storms exhibiting strong rotation on radar. Shortly after 4 pm, a tornado developed over southwest Marion County near the Pickwick community and tracked across the county into far western Lamar County before lifting. The same storm which produced this tornado continued eastward across northern Lamar County, producing a large tornado which touched down west of Oak Grove and tracked through the very populated West Hattiesburg area. The tornado continued into Forrest County, tracking through the cities of Hattiesburg and Petal before ending in northwestern Perry County. Considerable damage occurred along the path of this storm, and several people were injured. Scattered severe storms continued to affect the Pine Belt area through the remainder of the evening and into the early morning hours of the 11th, before finally moving out of the area.||In addition to severe weather, flash flooding was a major issue in several areas. From the 10th through the early morning hours of the 11th, the heaviest rainfall occurred over parts of southeast Mississippi, where 5 to 7 inches of rain fell and flash flooding was reported in the area. Rainfall amounts of up to 3 1/2 inches occurred in the Jackson metro area, leading to considerable flash flooding. Quick rises occurred on several streams in the city of Jackson.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado started along Highway 589, where some limbs and small trees were blown down. It became intense rather quickly, producing significant damage as it moved through the West Lake Serene area. The tornado reached its maximum intensity in the area around and just southwest of Oak Grove High School where maximum winds were estimated at 170 mph, which is EF-4 strength. There was a brick home in a subdivision southwest of the high school, just west of old Highway 11, that was completely leveled with all interior and exterior walls down, and a fair amount of large debris was blown downstream. Additionally, very high end timber damage occurred in this location with a number of trees showing debarking and denuding. Several other homes in this subdivision also sustained EF-2 to EF-3 damage. As the tornado crossed old Highway 11, it produced extensive damage on the campus of Oak Grove High School. The field house adjoining the football stadium was destroyed, the baseball stadium and a large metal building adjoining the stadium were essentially destroyed, and several large steel/concrete light standards were snapped at both the baseball and football stadiums. A vehicle was thrown from the parking lot adjoining the baseball stadium, up a small hill and was deposited near the pitching mound in the middle of the baseball field. The main building of the high school also suffered roof damage.||The tornado then moved northeast into the heavily populated areas of Oak Grove and West Hattiesburg, including areas along Lincoln Road Extension, Weathersby Road, Oak Grove Road, and the area just south of Highway 98 along Clark, Lamar and Foxgate Avenues. Numerous homes were destroyed or suffered major damage, and a few homes showed evidence of high end EF-3 damage. Dozens of power poles were snapped and extensive tree damage occurred. Video evidence and ground survey damage appeared to indicate that the tornado was multi-vortex in nature during its Lamar County portion. Just before crossing Interstate 59, it caused significant roof damage to a number of apartment buildings just west of the interstate. In total in Lamar County, emergency management indicated that 51 homes were destroyed and 170 suffered major damage.||The tornado then moved into Forrest County just to the south of Hardy Street damaging numerous homes with the damage in the EF-2 and EF-3 category. It then crossed Hardy Street impacting the southeast corner of the University of Southern Mississippi campus. Numerous buildings were damaged in this area including several campus buildings and a large church. Numerous power poles were blown down in this area and several metal traffic lights were bent or torn off their bases. Damage in this area was also EF-2 and EF-3.||The tornado continued across Highway 49 impacting multiple neighborhoods. Numerous roofs were blown off houses and many trees fell on houses and vehicles. The tornado crossed North Main Street causing significant damage to the Red Cross building, the Girl Scouts building, and bending large metal poles at the Hattiesburg High School athletic fields. The tornado then moved across east 7th Street causing significant damage to several large brick buildings. Damage in the area between north Main Street and east 7th Avenue was in the high end EF-3 range with maximum winds around 160 mph.||The tornado continued into Petal with the most significant damage occurring to an Ace Hardware store on South Main Street. Numerous homes in the vicinity of the hardware store also had roofs torn off and exterior walls collapsed. This damage was also rated high end EF-3 with maximum winds around 160 mph.||The tornado began to weaken as it crossed the Evelyn Gandy Parkway to the northeast of Petal. Damage in this area was mainly EF-1 and EF-2 and consisted of roof damage and snapped trees. The tornado strengthened one last time as it moved through a neighborhood just off Twin Lakes Road. Numerous well built homes experienced EF-2 damage to the roofs in this neighborhood. The tornado weakened as it approached the Perry County line and dissipated a couple of miles into Perry County. Damage at the end of the track was in the EF-0 to EF-1 range.||In Forrest County, emergency management indicated that 133 homes were destroyed and 207 suffered major damage. There were 63 reported injuries.||This is the second violent tornado to impact Lamar and Forrest Counties in recorded history. The other violent tornado was the infamous Purvis tornado on April 24, 1908 that was on the ground for 155 miles and impacted many counties across Mississippi. In total, 143 people were killed by this tornado, including 60 in Lamar County and 4 in Forrest County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 13.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

There was also a barn destroyed near Silver City in Humphreys County. The storms continued to push eastward through the early afternoon, then began to slow down as the cold front began to stall. To the south and east of this line of storms, several supercell thunderstorms developed in the more unstable air mass over south Mississippi, with many of the storms exhibiting strong rotation on radar. Shortly after 4 pm, a tornado developed over southwest Marion County near the Pickwick community and tracked across the county into far western Lamar County before lifting. The same storm which produced this tornado continued eastward across northern Lamar County, producing a large tornado which touched down west of Oak Grove and tracked through the very populated West Hattiesburg area. The tornado continued into Forrest County, tracking through the cities of Hattiesburg and Petal before ending in northwestern Perry County. Considerable damage occurred along the path of this storm, and several people were injured. Scattered severe storms continued to affect the Pine Belt area through the remainder of the evening and into the early morning hours of the 11th, before finally moving out of the area.||In addition to severe weather, flash flooding was a major issue in several areas. From the 10th through the early morning hours of the 11th, the heaviest rainfall occurred over parts of southeast Mississippi, where 5 to 7 inches of rain fell and flash flooding was reported in the area. Rainfall amounts of up to 3 1/2 inches occurred in the Jackson metro area, leading to considerable flash flooding. Quick rises occurred on several streams in the city of Jackson.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado started just inside Marion County on New Hope Road where a few outbuildings were destroyed. On the east side of the road, a home had a good portion of the roof torn off. The tornado then crossed Hurricane Creek Road and approached Mt Carmel Church Road, which is where the most intense damage occurred. Three mobile homes were completely destroyed with just the undercarriage left (3 injuries occurred here). A bit further northeast, the tornado crossed Regan Road where three homes sustained significant roof damage. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted in this area as well. The tornado weakened as it crossed Hwy 35, but continued to produce low end tree damage across Hwy 13 South and Game Reserve Road. Additional damage to structures occurred near the Lamar County line along Columbia-Purvis Road, Powell Lane and Culdesac Drive. The tornado then entered Lamar County causing additional damage to structures with one home off Wiley Lott Road having the roof removed. A number of power poles were snapped in this area as well, along with significant tree damage. The tornado dissipated shortly after producing this damage. Maximum wind speeds were estimated at 120 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Quick rises occurred on several streams in the city of Jackson.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado started along Highway 589, where some limbs and small trees were blown down. It became intense rather quickly, producing significant damage as it moved through the West Lake Serene area. The tornado reached its maximum intensity in the area around and just southwest of Oak Grove High School where maximum winds were estimated at 170 mph, which is EF-4 strength. There was a brick home in a subdivision southwest of the high school, just west of old Highway 11, that was completely leveled with all interior and exterior walls down, and a fair amount of large debris was blown downstream. Additionally, very high end timber damage occurred in this location with a number of trees showing debarking and denuding. Several other homes in this subdivision also sustained EF-2 to EF-3 damage. As the tornado crossed old Highway 11, it produced extensive damage on the campus of Oak Grove High School. The field house adjoining the football stadium was destroyed, the baseball stadium and a large metal building adjoining the stadium were essentially destroyed, and several large steel/concrete light standards were snapped at both the baseball and football stadiums. A vehicle was thrown from the parking lot adjoining the baseball stadium, up a small hill and was deposited near the pitching mound in the middle of the baseball field. The main building of the high school also suffered roof damage.||The tornado then moved northeast into the heavily populated areas of Oak Grove and West Hattiesburg, including areas along Lincoln Road Extension, Weathersby Road, Oak Grove Road, and the area just south of Highway 98 along Clark, Lamar and Foxgate Avenues. Numerous homes were destroyed or suffered major damage, and a few homes showed evidence of high end EF-3 damage. Dozens of power poles were snapped and extensive tree damage occurred. Video evidence and ground survey damage appeared to indicate that the tornado was multi-vortex in nature during its Lamar County portion. Just before crossing Interstate 59, it caused significant roof damage to a number of apartment buildings just west of the interstate. In total in Lamar County, emergency management indicated that 51 homes were destroyed and 170 suffered major damage.||The tornado then moved into Forrest County just to the south of Hardy Street damaging numerous homes with the damage in the EF-2 and EF-3 category. It then crossed Hardy Street impacting the southeast corner of the University of Southern Mississippi campus. Numerous buildings were damaged in this area including several campus buildings and a large church. Numerous power poles were blown down in this area and several metal traffic lights were bent or torn off their bases. Damage in this area was also EF-2 and EF-3.||The tornado continued across Highway 49 impacting multiple neighborhoods. Numerous roofs were blown off houses and many trees fell on houses and vehicles. The tornado crossed North Main Street causing significant damage to the Red Cross building, the Girl Scouts building, and bending large metal poles at the Hattiesburg High School athletic fields. The tornado then moved across east 7th Street causing significant damage to several large brick buildings. Damage in the area between north Main Street and east 7th Avenue was in the high end EF-3 range with maximum winds around 160 mph.||The tornado continued into Petal with the most significant damage occurring to an Ace Hardware store on South Main Street. Numerous homes in the vicinity of the hardware store also had roofs torn off and exterior walls collapsed. This damage was also rated high end EF-3 with maximum winds around 160 mph.||The tornado began to weaken as it crossed the Evelyn Gandy Parkway to the northeast of Petal. Damage in this area was mainly EF-1 and EF-2 and consisted of roof damage and snapped trees. The tornado strengthened one last time as it moved through a neighborhood just off Twin Lakes Road. Numerous well built homes experienced EF-2 damage to the roofs in this neighborhood. The tornado weakened as it approached the Perry County line and dissipated a couple of miles into Perry County. Damage at the end of the track was in the EF-0 to EF-1 range.||In Forrest County, emergency management indicated that 133 homes were destroyed and 207 suffered major damage. There were 63 reported injuries.||This is the second violent tornado to impact Lamar and Forrest Counties in recorded history. The other violent tornado was the infamous Purvis tornado on April 24, 1908 that was on the ground for 155 miles and impacted many counties across Mississippi. In total, 143 people were killed by this tornado, including 60 in Lamar County and 4 in Forrest County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A very slow moving cold front moved through Texas into Louisiana during the day on the 10th, bringing tornadoes to portions of central Arkansas near Little Rock. Some thunderstorms developed ahead of the approaching squall line, bringing some hail to portions of northeast Louisiana. Without a strong push behind the front, it lingered across locations west of the Mississippi River through most of the evening and overnight hours of the 10th through 11th. ||The cold front and squall line finally pushed east early on the 11th. Temperatures across east Mississippi were able to remain warm and conditions remained unstable and supportive of severe weather. A few supercells developed ahead of the cold front. One that tracked through Kemper and Noxubee counties spawned a tornado that caused structural damage in this area. Unfortunately, five injuries and one fatality also occurred in Kemper County near Liberty. Another 4 injuries occurred in Noxubee County as well. Additional damage was noted in Clarke, Jasper and Forrest counties where trees were downed and some damage to structures was reported. ||The cold front and post frontal rains finally moved out of the ArkLaMiss by mid afternoon, causing additional damage east to Alabama and Georgia. ||In addition to severe weather, the region once again saw plenty of rainfall. On the 10th, locations across the Delta saw 1.5-3.5 inches of rain. The rain was more progressive as it tracked east but 1 to 2 inches was seen.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado first touched down in southwest Kemper County and tracked north-northeast through much of Kemper and Noxubee Counties, and then into Pickens County Alabama.  The most intense damage occurred in five locations along the path.  The first was damage to a steel frame commercial building along highway 493 just north of Moscow.  The second was a frame home that was completely destroyed along Highway 16 several miles west of De Kalb.

A very slow moving cold front moved through Texas into Louisiana during the day on the 10th, bringing tornadoes to portions of central Arkansas near Little Rock. Some thunderstorms developed ahead of the approaching squall line, bringing some hail to portions of northeast Louisiana. Without a strong push behind the front, it lingered across locations west of the Mississippi River through most of the evening and overnight hours of the 10th through 11th. ||The cold front and squall line finally pushed east early on the 11th. Temperatures across east Mississippi were able to remain warm and conditions remained unstable and supportive of severe weather. A few supercells developed ahead of the cold front. One that tracked through Kemper and Noxubee counties spawned a tornado that caused structural damage in this area. Unfortunately, five injuries and one fatality also occurred in Kemper County near Liberty. Another 4 injuries occurred in Noxubee County as well. Additional damage was noted in Clarke, Jasper and Forrest counties where trees were downed and some damage to structures was reported. ||The cold front and post frontal rains finally moved out of the ArkLaMiss by mid afternoon, causing additional damage east to Alabama and Georgia. ||In addition to severe weather, the region once again saw plenty of rainfall. On the 10th, locations across the Delta saw 1.5-3.5 inches of rain. The rain was more progressive as it tracked east but 1 to 2 inches was seen.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado first touched down in southwest Kemper County and tracked north-northeast through much of Kemper and Noxubee Counties, and then into Pickens County Alabama.  The most intense damage occurred in five locations along the path.  The first was damage to a steel frame commercial building along highway 493 just north of Moscow.  The second was a frame home that was completely destroyed along Highway 16 several miles west of De Kalb.  The third was an extensive area of damage just west and northwest of Shuqualak that included a destroyed home as well as significant damage to several other homes and power poles.  The fourth was high tension power poles that were bent along Highway 45 just north of Shuqualak.

Several tree branches were damaged along with several overturned grave markers. The tornado continued north-northeast crossing Hardwich Street where several outbuildings sustained damage, and County Road 39 and State Road 14 where several additonal homes and outbuildings were damaged or destroyed. On County Road 39, one brick home sustained major roofing loss and window glass breakage. One minor injury was caused from flying glass. Also in the same area, one mobile home had significant damage while another was completely destroyed. The tornado crossed State Road 14, strengthening to its maximum intensity. It significantly damaged a well-built two-story home, with considerable loss of roof material, one outer wall completely destroyed and another outer wall significantly damaged. Of note, the family of five took cover in an interior closet on the lowest level which kept them from injury. The tornado continued northeastward where it damaged an additional outbuilding pavilion, and crossed into Lee County, lifting along Roxana Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These storms caused wind damage across portions of northeast Central Alabama during the late afternoon.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed the damage in Macon and Lee Counties and have determined that the damage was due to an EF-2 tornado. Wind speeds in Macon County are estimated at 120 mph. The tornado initially touched down along St. John���s Church Road at Saint John���s Church. Several tree branches were damaged along with several overturned grave markers. The tornado continued north-northeast crossing Hardwich Street where several outbuildings sustained damage, and County Road 39 and State Road 14 where several additonal homes and outbuildings were damaged or destroyed. On County Road 39, one brick home sustained major roofing loss and window glass breakage. One minor injury was caused from flying glass. Also in the same area, one mobile home had significant damage while another was completely destroyed. The tornado crossed State Road 14, strengthening to its maximum intensity. It significantly damaged a well-built two-story home, with considerable loss of roof material, one outer wall completely destroyed and another outer wall significantly damaged. Of note, the family of five took cover in an interior closet on the lowest level which kept them from injury. The tornado continued northeastward where it damaged an additional outbuilding pavilion, and crossed into Lee County, lifting along Roxana Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Although the day began cloudy, some breaks of sun started to occur by early afternoon.  At the same time, a potent upper level disturbance over Ontario started to approach the region and a strong jet streak was located just to the north.  With a moist southerly flow moving into the region at the surface, it became rather humid as well.  ||With all these ingredients coming together, thunderstorms developed across western and central New York by mid afternoon and they began to spread eastward into eastern New York by the late afternoon and evening hours.  Many of the thunderstorms organized into a strong squall line, producing widespread wind damage, especially across northern portions of the Capital Region and in the mid-Hudson Valley. These thunderstorms produced a significant amount of lightning, as well, which in combination with the widespread wind damage, led to a significant number of power outages across the area.  Many schools in the Capital Region were delayed or closed on Thursday, May 30th as a result of the power outages.||In addition, a few supercell thunderstorms developed ahead of the line.  Three tornadoes were spawned by these supercell storms across the Capital Region and Schoharie County.  The strongest tornado was rated EF2 by a National Weather Service storm survey, and tracked on the ground for 13 miles across eastern Montgomery and Schenectady Counties.  One injury occurred as a result of this tornado, as a man was pulled out of a barn by the force of the wind.  Significant damage to trees occurred, along with damage to high tension power line towers and roofs blown off houses.  The other tornadoes were rated EF1, were rather short-lived and mainly caused damage to trees.||With the region already rather saturated from repeated thunderstorms over the past week, the additional heavy rainfall that occurred caused flash flooding in some areas. This caused roads to be closed due to being impassable by flowing water.||Thunderstorms pushed east of the area by around midnight, ending the threat of severe weather.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service storm survey determined that a tornado tracked from the Montgomery County border through the towns of Duanesburg, Princetown, Rotterdam and into the city of Schenectady.||The tornado entered the county as an EF1 and strengthened to EF2 strength when reaching the hamlet of Mariaville Lake in the town of Duanesburg. Many trees were splintered in half or uprooted.  Several barns and a shed were destroyed or heavily damaged.  One barn was impaled by pieces of debris.  An ATV vehicle was moved 100 feet by the force of the wind and an RV was blown over.  Homes had damaged to roofs and windows were blown out of cars as well.  One person was inside a barn at the time the tornado hit.  He was picked up into the air by the tornado and injured by flying debris, suffering lacerations to his head and back.||Further east along the path, the tornado toppled or heavily damaged high tension power line towers that were 90 to 120 feet tall.  The tornado weakened as it moved eastward into Rotterdam, but continued to cause significant damage to trees.  The tornado crossed Interstate 90 (New York State Thruway) and weakened to EF0 strength as it passed close to the Rotterdam Square Mall.

In Indiana alone there were 29 tornadoes, with dozens more in other states. In central Indiana the strongest tornado was rated an EF-3. There were 8 EF-2 tornadoes, 6 EF-1 tornadoes, and 1 EF-0 tornado in central Indiana. This number of tornadoes for the entire state is the largest outbreak for November in recorded history for Indiana, and the third largest outbreak in state history for any month (June 2, 1990 is first with 37 tornadoes, April 19, 2011 is second with 29 tornadoes). ||A potent weather system moved into the Ohio Valley during the afternoon of November 17, 2013. The setup became ideal for severe weather, including multiple tornadoes.  A strong jet stream was approaching central Indiana during the afternoon of November 17. An upper trough was approaching the area as well. Not far off the surface, strong winds were flowing north from the Gulf of Mexico. Speeds at 500 meters over Indiana at 3:00 PM were over 50 mph. This system's setup provided the area with plenty of instability for thunderstorms to form. The turning of the winds with height, set up by the approaching upper trough and winds ahead of the surface cold front, set the stage for the potential for tornadoes. The effective storm relative helicity values, by mid-afternoon,were 500 to 700 m2/s2 across central Indiana and were extremely high for November. As a result of this setup, numerous thunderstorms developed across Illinois and quickly became severe. These storms produced numerous tornadoes across Illinois. The strong winds aloft caused the storms to move quickly into Indiana, where additional tornadoes and severe thunderstorms developed.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> At 1456EST, this EF-2 tornado touched down 4.5 miles west-northwest of Decker. The most extensive damage was found north of Decker along Old Decker Road, just to the east of Route 41. The second story of a home was removed with the exterior walls collapsed. This tornado continued until it was 6 miles southeast of Vincennes at 1506EST. The estimated maximum wind speed with this EF-2 tornado was 130 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 75.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In Indiana alone there were 29 tornadoes, with dozens more in other states. In central Indiana the strongest tornado was rated an EF-3. There were 8 EF-2 tornadoes, 6 EF-1 tornadoes, and 1 EF-0 tornado in central Indiana. This number of tornadoes for the entire state is the largest outbreak for November in recorded history for Indiana, and the third largest outbreak in state history for any month (June 2, 1990 is first with 37 tornadoes, April 19, 2011 is second with 29 tornadoes). ||A potent weather system moved into the Ohio Valley during the afternoon of November 17, 2013. The setup became ideal for severe weather, including multiple tornadoes.  A strong jet stream was approaching central Indiana during the afternoon of November 17. An upper trough was approaching the area as well. Not far off the surface, strong winds were flowing north from the Gulf of Mexico. Speeds at 500 meters over Indiana at 3:00 PM were over 50 mph. This system's setup provided the area with plenty of instability for thunderstorms to form. The turning of the winds with height, set up by the approaching upper trough and winds ahead of the surface cold front, set the stage for the potential for tornadoes. The effective storm relative helicity values, by mid-afternoon,were 500 to 700 m2/s2 across central Indiana and were extremely high for November. As a result of this setup, numerous thunderstorms developed across Illinois and quickly became severe. These storms produced numerous tornadoes across Illinois. The strong winds aloft caused the storms to move quickly into Indiana, where additional tornadoes and severe thunderstorms developed.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> At 1456EST, this EF-2 tornado touched down 4.5 miles west-northwest of Decker.

This structure also had large plate glass windows blown in. Additional significant roof damage occurred to a neighboring business, as well as the snapping of some power poles. The tornado continued on to a restaurant, in which the windows were blown in and significant fa��ade and roof damage occurred. Eight people inside the restaurant sustained minor injuries from glass. In the restaurant parking lot, there were numerous vehicles which had windows blown out, with some vehicles shifted or pushed from their parked location. There was a large pickup truck which was lifted and tossed, landing on top of another vehicle. The tornado continued into a residential subdivision, where at least 3 homes sustained damage which rendered them uninhabitable. There were additional homes with partial wall collapses and more than half the roof removed. Other homes had holes in the roof due to being impaled by debris. There was also significant damage due to large trees being snapped off and damaging the homes. Large portions of roofing and sheds were carried at least a city block. The tornado then lifted while in the residential subdivision.

Several tornadoes occurred from central Oklahoma down through south central Oklahoma near the Red River. The strongest tornado touched down near Newcastle and traveled through Moore and south Oklahoma City. This tornado caused catastrophic damage in these areas, with a maximum rating of EF-5. The tornado claimed 24 lives and caused billions of dollars in damage. In addition to the tornadoes, large hail and damaging winds cause damage in many areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The violent Newcastle-Moore tornado moved into Cleveland County from McClain County as it moved northeast across the Canadian River near Interstate 44. The tornado then turned more east and then east-northeast after crossing Interstate 44. Violent EF4 damage was again observed as it began to move into progressively higher density residential areas approaching May Avenue.||The center of the large tornado path passed near SW 149th Street and Western Avenue. After crossing Western Avenue, numerous buildings were destroyed and horses killed at Orr Family Farm. Two storage tanks estimated to weigh approximately 10 tons were lifted from Orr Family Farm and landed about one-half mile east. Moving east, the tornado destroyed much of Briarwood Elementary School, where the NWS storm survey team initially rated the damage as EF5. However, further evaluation indicated that an EF4 rating was more appropriate at the school. Despite the destruction of this elementary school during school hours, no fatalities occurred at the school. As the tornado continued to move east and east-northeast, it moved through much more densely populated suburban neighborhoods of southwest Oklahoma City and Moore where violent destruction was widespread and a few houses were rated EF5. The width of EF4 and greater damage was up to 250 yards wide as the tornado moved through neighborhoods east of Western Avenue. The first two fatalities occurred in a house in the neighborhood just east of Briarwood Elementary, with another fatality in a house as the tornado approached Santa Fe Avenue. ||After crossing Santa Fe Avenue, the tornado moved through more suburban neighborhoods and toward Plaza Towers Elementary School. Damage to the school was extensive and seven children were killed when a wall collapsed at the school. Nine other people were killed in eight different neighborhood homes within one-quarter mile of Plaza Towers Elementary, most occurring just south of the school.||The tornado turned northeast as it approached Telephone Road, made a loop near the intersection of Telephone Road and 4th Street, then moved southeast crossing the interstate. Three people were killed when a convenience store along Telephone Road was destroyed. Crossing Telephone Road, the tornado inflicted significant damage to the Moore Medical Center, a post office and numerous businesses along Telephone Road and Interstate 35. Although the tornado was more narrow after crossing Interstate 35, it continued to produce EF4 damage in neighborhoods east of the interstate as it curved east and then again east-northeast. One fatality occurred at a business just east of the interstate, and one final fatality occurred in a home between Eastern Avenue and Bryant Avenue. Consistent EF4 damage continued until the tornado passed SE 4th Street just east of Bryant Avenue. Moving east from Bryant, the tornado continued to produce EF2 damage with isolated EF4 damage noted. The density of housing also decreased east of Bryant as the tornado moved east and east-northeast before dissipating east of Air Depot Blvd. between SE 119th Street and SE 134th Street in southeast Oklahoma City.||Overall, over 300 homes experienced EF4/EF5 damage along the tornado path.

The first and most intense thunderstorm of the day developed over northern Phillips county just after 4:30 pm CDT. This was the southern storm in a line segment of supercell storms, which exhibited multicell characteristics. This line extended northeast across the border into southern Nebraska. During the following four hours, this storm tracked east across Phillips, Smith and Jewell counties. Numerous storm chasers followed this storm. The initial storm report came from the rear flank of the storm, over Phillips county. It was here that the RFD produced winds estimated around 60 mph. As the storm moved east, two weak, brief tornadoes were spotted just northwest and northeast of Smith Center. A rain-wrapped EF-3 tornado, described as a wedge, then followed, tracking just north of Lebanon and Esbon. The tornado track was roughly 6 miles long and at its widest point, was nearly one mile wide. Even though this tornado was over rural areas, it still managed to produce damage. The worst damage was to a home that lost its roof and part of its second story. ||On radar, the hook echo was short and stubby. Because of this, there was substantial rain within the mesocyclone, which made it difficult to see the tornado except in its immediate vicinity. The Tornado Intercept Vehicle endured a direct hit from the tornado, with video confirmation. As this storm continued into Jewell County, no more reports of wind damage or tornadoes were received. However, the hail dramatically increased with multiple reports of hail to the size of tennis balls. The largest hail was yet to occur. Near Montrose, hail a little large than grapefruit size was reported (5 and 1/4 inches). After 7:00 pm CDT, other multicell storms developed, mainly affecting Mitchell county. These storms only produced a single report of 1 inch hail northwest of Beloit.||With the 8 am CDT Severe Weather Outlook, the Storm Prediction Center upgraded North Central Kansas to a moderate risk for severe thunderstorms. A weak short-wave trough was approaching the region, embedded within a broad upper-level trough, over the western United States. A quasi-stationary front, oriented in an east-west fashion, extended across Nebraska. During the early morning hours, a mesoscale convective system tracked through eastern Nebraska southeastward into Missouri. This MCS laid down an outflow boundary that extended across northern Kansas, to a lee-side low. It was to the north of this outflow boundary that storms initiated. At the time of initial thunderstorm development, temperatures were in the lower to middle 80s to near 90, with dewpoints in the middle 60s. This resulted in an extremely unstable atmosphere, with MLCAPE between 3000 and 4000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was 40 to 50 knots, which was more that strong enough for supercell storm structures.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado affected two counties in north central Kansas, touching down north of Lebanon in Smith County and lifting north of Esbon in Jewell County. The maximum wind speed was estimated to be near 140 MPH, with a maximum path width of 1580 yards. Along its path, this tornado caused minor to major tree damage, overturned irrigation pivots, snapped power poles and damaged or destroyed grain bins and outbuildings. Four homesteads suffered damage, with the hardest hit locations approximately 3 miles northeast of Lebanon in Smith County. Two homes in this area were heavily damaged or destroyed, with one losing its entire second level. This location also completely lost grain bins, a large outbuilding and newly constructed garage.

This resulted in an extremely unstable atmosphere, with MLCAPE between 3000 and 4000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was 40 to 50 knots, which was more that strong enough for supercell storm structures.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado affected two counties in north central Kansas, touching down north of Lebanon in Smith County and lifting north of Esbon in Jewell County. The maximum wind speed was estimated to be near 140 MPH, with a maximum path width of 1580 yards. Along its path, this tornado caused minor to major tree damage, overturned irrigation pivots, snapped power poles and damaged or destroyed grain bins and outbuildings. Four homesteads suffered damage, with the hardest hit locations approximately 3 miles northeast of Lebanon in Smith County. Two homes in this area were heavily damaged or destroyed, with one losing its entire second level. This location also completely lost grain bins, a large outbuilding and newly constructed garage. One person suffered minor injuries and was treated and released from an area hospital.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.40M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

There was record rainfall in the San Antonio area with the San Antonio International Airport recording 9.87 inches of rain (2nd highest 24 hr total on record) and CoCoRAHS observers reporting over 11 inches.  Most of the rain fell in about six hours with four inches in one hour between 6 and 7 AM. A USGS stream and rain gauge on Olmos Creek and Dresden Drive reported 2.58 inches in 15 min between 615 and 630 am.  The gauge reported 6.13 inches in one hour, 9.46 inches in 2 hours, and totaled 15.31 inches in 5 hours.  A 24hr total at this gauge was 17 inches of rain.  This led to massive flooding in the Olmos Basin/Creek just inside Loop 410 near the Quarry.  Most of the flooding across the city was in north central and northwest San Antonio along and just side Loop 410. This rain came a day after another heavy rain event with parts of the city receiving over two inches. This all led to major flooding with Olmos Creek, the Medina River, Leon Creek, the San Antonio River, and Salado Creek all reaching major flood stage. There were many roads closed including Hwy 281 at Olmos Creek which remained closed for several days. At 10 AM, there was a foot of water over Ingram and Callaghan Rds. San Antonio creeks and streams saw big rises in their levels which led to additional flooding down steam in the south portion of Bexar County.  Areas that were hit the hardest included the Espada Road area near the San Antonio River and Loop 410 intersection.  A mobile home park on Plumnear Road off Leon Creek on the southwest side of the city was flooded out.  Several hundred rescues and calls for rescue occurred during the morning of the 25th.  Two fatalities occurred inside Bexar County. A woman was killed when her car was swept away in flood waters along Leon Creek at the 5800 Block of U.S Highway 90.  Another woman was killed in her car when her car was swept away in the 400 Block of Rhapsody Drive about 730 am.  In all the City of San Antonio and Bexar County Emergency Management agencies found over 350 impacted residences with 15 of those being destroyed and 27 suffering major damage.  The other residences suffered minor damages.  Most of the destroyed residences were in the Espada area along the San Antonio River in southeast Bexar County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This made the region susceptible to additional flooding.||An unusually strong area of low pressure for late June moved from central Pennsylvania northeastward across eastern New York during the early morning hours of Friday, June 28th.   This storm system was more typical of a winter-like storm, due to deep low pressure and heavy precipitation spiraling around the western side of the storm system.  A strong southerly flow ahead of this system transported very moist air into the region.||Heavy rainfall moved across the Mohawk Valley and western Adirondacks in advance of the low pressure during the early morning hours. The rain fell heaviest during the late night hours before tapering off during the late morning.  Rainfall fell at rates of nearly one inch per hour at times with three to five inches of rainfall having occurred in total. This led to significant flash flooding across both the Mohawk Valley and Adirondacks. ||Many roads were washed out and closed, including a portion of the New York State Thruway between exits 29 (Canajoharie) and 29A (Little Falls).  In addition, urbanized areas along the Mohawk River experienced dangerous amounts of flooding.  The entire town of Fort Plain was under water and many swift water rescues had to take place.  Many homes and trailers were impacted by flood waters.  The New York State Barge Canal was closed as a result of the flooding.  In addition, one fatality occurred as a result of the flooding. ||State of emergencies were declared in many communities as a result of the flooding including:  Herkimer County, Montgomery County, Village of Ilion (Herkimer County),  Town and Village of Herkimer (Herkimer County), Village of Mohawk (Herkimer County), Town of Johnsburg (Warren County), Town of Minden (Montgomery County), and the Town of German Flatts (Herkimer County). | |On July 12th, President Obama signed a New York Disaster Declaration and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area affected by severe storms and flooding during the period of June 28 to July 4, 2013.

Tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, and flash flooding occurred. The flooding killed six people, and the tornadoes killed one. The same weather system caused severe storms and flash flooding again on June 1st. For the 24-hour period ending at 7 AM on the 31st, a band of very heavy rain fell from Waldron and Mena to Conway and Little Rock and then on to Newport and Augusta. Within this band, rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches were common, and isolated totals exceeded 7 inches. Also on the evening of the 30th, 3.09 inches of rain fell in one hour at Little Rock, breaking the all-time record for the greatest amount of rain in one hour in the city. The previous record was 3.00 inches on May 26, 1955. President Barack Obama declared federal disasters in these counties:  Cleburne, Independence, Montgomery, Polk, Scott, Searcy, Stone, Van Buren, and Woodruff.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Severe flash flooding occurred across a large part of Scott County. Soon after Midnight CDT on the 31st, two women called 911 after flooding from Mill Creek trapped them in their house at Y City. The Scott County Sheriff and a Wildlife Officer First Class from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission responded to the call. According to the incident report by the Game and Fish Commission, the rescuers reached the house in an aluminum motorboat, removed one woman from the house and put here in their boat. As they were trying to rescue the second woman, the house collapsed due to the force of the floodwaters. The boat then capsized, drowning the three people in the boat, and the woman in the house also drowned. (The sheriff was a 41 year-old male, the wildlife officer was a 32 year-old male, and the women in the house were females 60 and 65 years old.) It took until June 2nd to recover the bodies of all the victims. Recovery operations were greatly hampered by another round of heavy rain and flooding on the morning of June 1st. Altogether, about 20 people had to be rescued from the flood waters. U.S. 71, the main north-south route through western Arkansas, flooded at Y City. The flooding caused a car to be washed off the highway and a 42 year-old woman in the car drowned. Her husband survived, but had to cling to the bank of a stream for 6 hours before being rescued. Several other cars were washed off roads, as well, but the motorists survived. Arkansas 28 was washed out at Little Cedar Creek (10 miles east of Y City), Big Cedar Creek (12 miles east of Y City), and the Fourche LaFave River (16.5 miles east of Y City). Numerous county roads and bridges were washed out. For the 24-hour period ending at 7 AM on the 31st, Parks measured 7.78 inches of rain and Waldron picked up 5.26 inches. Houses were flooded at a number of places, including Y City, Boles, and Parks. The American Red Cross indicated 7 houses and 15 mobile homes were destroyed, 9 houses and 4 mobile home had major damage, 13 houses and 3 mobile homes had minor damage, and 14 houses and 8 mobile homes were affected. A fiber optic cable was knocked out of service. As a result, there was no landline phone service, cell phone service, or internet service to most of the county for about 24 hours from the 30th into the 31st.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 9.20M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A couple of locations saw the highest flood crests in over 20 years.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An Owen County woman was killed Christmas Eve when her car hit flooded waters on her way to a Christmas family gathering. According to a release, emergency crews responded to the area around 8:00 p.m. Tuesday for a call that a car landed in flooded water. When they got to the vehicle, they say there wasn't anyone inside. After a brief search, including a door-to-door search, they found the driver, 86, partially submerged in the water a short distance from the car. She was pronounced dead at the scene.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In addition, a weak stationary front stretched along the Front Range Foothills and Palmer Divide.  As a result, a prolonged period of moderate to heavy rain developed across the Front Range Foothills, Palmer Divide, Urban Corridor.  By the 14th, storm totals ranged from 6 to 18 inches, highest in the foothills of Boulder County.  The headwaters then moved down the South Platte River and caused widespread flooding with record flood stages at several locations as it made its way downstream into Nebraska.  Record high flood stages along the South Platte River were recorded at Balzac, Weldona and Julesburg.  As a result, widespread flooding occur along the South Platte for several days as the headwaters continued downstream, with much of the damage reported from Fort Morgan and Brush to around Sterling.  The floodwaters resulted in widespread evacuations.  Numerous water treatment facilities were contaminated and had to be shut down.  The headwaters remained at or above flood stage east of Sterling to Julesburg, but the flooding was not as widespread and the damage not as extensive. ||Initially, the showers that developed on the afternoon of the 11th were moving fast enough and were small enough to produce generally moderate rainfall amounts.   However, rain along the Front Range began to intensify and become more widespread in the evening. A narrow band of very heavy rain began to organize just north of Denver and move westward toward the foothills.  By 9 pm mdt on the 11th, heavy rain was becoming more widespread, with rainfall rates near 2 inches per hour in the heaviest showers.  From 10 pm mdt to Midnight mdt, very heavy rain locked itself in against the Front Range.  Flash flooding became more widespread, with several road closures from northwest Jefferson County northward through Boulder and Larimer Counties.  The heaviest rain in the foothills of Boulder, Larimer and northern Jefferson Counties finally began to abate, but widespread flash flooding continued due to the extremely heavy rainfall during the evening and early morning hours of the 12th.  Meanwhile, torrential rain redeveloped in southwest Weld, northeast Adams, eastern Denver and northwest Arapahoe Counties in the early morning hours of the 12th;  which impacted northeast Denver and Aurora.  ||Atypical for September in Colorado, 24-hour rainfall totals ending 7 am mdt on September 12th included 6.5 to 8.6 inches in Boulder; with 3 to 6.5 inches across the Larimer and Boulder County foothills, as well an area stretching from northeastern Metro Denver area into southwest Weld County.  By 9 am mdt, heavy rain and considerable flash flooding continued through the morning in the Aurora area.   Numerous streams remained at or above bankfull levels across Boulder, Larimer, and southwest Weld counties.  By the evening of the 12th, flooding continued in many areas and increased in severity. Heavy rain, while not as widespread as the previous day, had a greater impact on stream levels as streams were already elevated and the ground was completely saturated. Two peaks of flows occurred on Boulder Creek near downtown. The peak flow on the evening of September 12th surpassed the 1969 Boulder flood, but initial indications are that it fell short of the 1938 and 1894 floods.  Boulder Stream Gauge ���peak flows occurred near 0100 mdt on the 12th, and 2100 mdt on the 12th.

Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  The headwaters moved down the South Platte with floodwaters impacted Weld, Morgan, Washington and Logan Counties.  Extensive flooding occurred in and around Greeley, Fort Morgan and Sterling.  Large sections of the counties' roads and highways were washed away, with property and crops completely inundated.   ||After little rainfall on Friday, September 13th, the flash flood threat returned for  Saturday. This time, storms with heavy rainfall were concentrated in Douglas County, but also extended northeast into the Aurora area once again. Up to 3 inches of rain fell in one hour.  Plum Creek and other small creeks and streams flooded, along with significant street flooding.  The last day of this prolonged period of very heavy rainfall was on Sunday, September 15th. Another weak front had pushed through the area Saturday night, leaving the atmosphere unseasonably moist and unstable.  Heavy rain developed by mid morning and then became more widespread and peaked in intensity by the noon hour. This time, flash flooding was most significant in the northern portions of the Denver metro area from Northglenn to around Broomfield. Rain finally tapered off during the late afternoon and evening.||The devastating flood damage encompassed 4,500 square miles of the Colorado Front Range, left seven dead, forced thousands to evacuate, and destroyed thousands of homes and farms. Record amounts of rainfall generated flash floods that tore up roads and lines of communication, leaving many stranded.  Nearly 19,000 homes were damaged, and over 1,500 destroyed.  The Colorado Department of Transportation estimated that at least 30 state highway bridges were destroyed and an additional 20 seriously damaged. A preliminary assessment of the state's infrastructure showed damage of $40 million to roads and $112 million to bridges.  Repair costs for state and and county roads were likely to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Miles of freight and passenger rail lines were washed out or submerged, including a section servicing Amtrak's iconic California Zephyr.  The town of Lyons in Boulder County was isolated by the flooding of St. Vrain Creek, and several earth dams along the Front Range burst or were over-topped.   Floodwaters also swept through Estes Park, the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park and a major tourist attraction, and damaged hundreds of buildings and destroyed large sections of the two main roads that led into town; U.S. 34 from Loveland and U.S. 36 from Lyons/Boulder.  U.S. 34 suffered the most damage, with 85 percent of its roadway and bridges destroyed.   In Weld County, approximately 1,900 gas wells were damaged and had to be closed off as the floodwaters inundated entire communities. ||Sewage treatment plants and other utilities were knocked out in a number of towns,  and standing water left by floods on prairie farmlands posed the threat of significant damage to crops already planted in the region.  Northeast Colorado Health Department has advised with the local CSU Extension office in Logan County regarding local crops and gardens that had been exposed to flood waters.  As the flood waters in our area should be considered contaminated, local crops and gardens may not be considered suitable for human consumption or animal feed.  In the flooded areas, an estimated 23,000 acres of cropland was impacted and stretched from Boulder to Logan Counties and included:  alfalfa, corn, hay, silage and sugar beets.  The estimated loss of production ranged from $3.4 million to $5.5 million. ||Governor Hickenlooper declared a disaster emergency on September 13th, in 11 counties across northeast Colorado including:  Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Boulder, Denver, Jefferson, Larimer, Logan, Morgan, Washington and Weld.  By September 15th, federal emergency declarations covered those counties as well as Clear Creek County.  Projected losses from the flooding statewide was nearly $3 billion in property damage.  Half of the damage estimate was from housing and half from the commercial and government sectors, according to Eqecat, a catastrophe modeling firm; this was the first comprehensive estimate of the disaster's economic toll.  The projected losses for residential property alone were about $900 million.  Another $1 billion was attributed to commercial and goverment property, including roads and bridges.  In addition, more than 11 thousand people were evacuated, reportedly the largest since Hurricane Katrina.  President Obama declared a state of emergency for Boulder and Larimer Counties, with an additional 10 counties added September 16th including: Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Clear Creek, Denver, Jefferson, Morgan, Logan, Washington and Weld Counties.  The president also declared a major disaster specifically for Boulder County, which provided for federal recovery assistance. ||There were six fatalities directly attributed to flash flooding.  By county, those fatalities included 4 in Boulder County and 2 in Larimer County.  Two 19-yr old teenagers died on the evening of the 11th, after they were swept away by floodwaters after abandoning their vehicle on Lindon Drive in Boulder.  In Jamestown, a 72-yr old man was killed when the building he was in collapsed.  An 80-yr old Lyons resident was killed in the early morning hours of the 12th, when his truck was swept into the St. Vrain River near his home.   On the evening of the 12th, a 79-yr old Larimer County resident was killed when she was swept away while trying to climb to safety from her home in Cedar Point.   A 61-yr old Cedar Point resident died when her home was swept down the Big Thompson River by the floodwaters.  An indirect fatality occurred on the 16th.  An 80-yr old Idaho Springs resident drowned in Clear Creek when the embankment he was standing on collapsed.||Along the South Platte River, the crest of the flood at Kersey was near 18.8 feet on September 14th, which was significantly higher than the record crest of 11.73 feet set on May 8, 1973.   On September 15th, the flood crest was near 13.7 feet at Balzac which exceeded the record of 13.3 feet set on June 18, 1965.  On September 18th, the flood crest was at Julesburg was 10.6 feet, which broke the previous record of 10.44 feet set on June 20, 1965.  ||In Boulder, some of the monthly records broken included:  one-day all-time record:  9.08 inches which shattered the previous wettest day of 4.8 inches set on July 31, 1919; one-month record of 18.16 inches, which broke the previous all-time monthly record of 9.59 inches set in May of 1995; wettest September on record which broke the previous record of 5.5 inches set in September of 1940; one-year record of 34.15 inches broke the previous wettest year of 29.93 inches set in 1995.  In Denver, the total precipitation for the month of September was 5.61 inches, which was 4.65 inches above the normal of 0.96 inches. This is the most precipitation ever recorded in Denver for the month of September.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> In Boulder, Old Tale Road at McSorley was closed due to debris and downed trees.  Debris forced the partial closure of 3rd Street and Canyon and the Eastbound lane of Baseline Road near Foothills Parkway.  Flooding was also reported at:  9th and Alpine,   9th and Balsam and South Boulder Road at Manhatten Street.  Two teenagers in Boulder were killed when they abandoned their vehicle while trying to flee the floodwaters.  The two other occupants suffered minor injuries; one escaped the vehicle while the other remained in the car and was later rescued.  In the city of Boulder, 61 properties were destroyed.||In the Fourmile burn area, widespread flash flooding and debris flows forced the closure of Fourmile Canyon at Boulder Canyon.  Water was also reportedly flowing over Gold Run Road at Ingram Gulch due to a blocked culvert.  Major structural damage occurred in Fourmile Canyon and Jamestown, which forced a mandatory evacuation of all residents.  A man in Jamestown was killed when the building he was in collapsed.  In the Jamestown area, 26 properties were destroyed.  Flash flooding was also reported in Lefthand Canyon. In unincorporated Boulder County, a total of 86 properties were destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In addition, a weak stationary front stretched along the Front Range Foothills and Palmer Divide.  As a result, a prolonged period of moderate to heavy rain developed across the Front Range Foothills, Palmer Divide, Urban Corridor.  By the 14th, storm totals ranged from 6 to 18 inches, highest in the foothills of Boulder County.  The headwaters then moved down the South Platte River and caused widespread flooding with record flood stages at several locations as it made its way downstream into Nebraska.  Record high flood stages along the South Platte River were recorded at Balzac, Weldona and Julesburg.  As a result, widespread flooding occur along the South Platte for several days as the headwaters continued downstream, with much of the damage reported from Fort Morgan and Brush to around Sterling.  The floodwaters resulted in widespread evacuations.  Numerous water treatment facilities were contaminated and had to be shut down.  The headwaters remained at or above flood stage east of Sterling to Julesburg, but the flooding was not as widespread and the damage not as extensive. ||Initially, the showers that developed on the afternoon of the 11th were moving fast enough and were small enough to produce generally moderate rainfall amounts.   However, rain along the Front Range began to intensify and become more widespread in the evening. A narrow band of very heavy rain began to organize just north of Denver and move westward toward the foothills.  By 9 pm mdt on the 11th, heavy rain was becoming more widespread, with rainfall rates near 2 inches per hour in the heaviest showers.  From 10 pm mdt to Midnight mdt, very heavy rain locked itself in against the Front Range.  Flash flooding became more widespread, with several road closures from northwest Jefferson County northward through Boulder and Larimer Counties.  The heaviest rain in the foothills of Boulder, Larimer and northern Jefferson Counties finally began to abate, but widespread flash flooding continued due to the extremely heavy rainfall during the evening and early morning hours of the 12th.  Meanwhile, torrential rain redeveloped in southwest Weld, northeast Adams, eastern Denver and northwest Arapahoe Counties in the early morning hours of the 12th;  which impacted northeast Denver and Aurora.  ||Atypical for September in Colorado, 24-hour rainfall totals ending 7 am mdt on September 12th included 6.5 to 8.6 inches in Boulder; with 3 to 6.5 inches across the Larimer and Boulder County foothills, as well an area stretching from northeastern Metro Denver area into southwest Weld County.  By 9 am mdt, heavy rain and considerable flash flooding continued through the morning in the Aurora area.   Numerous streams remained at or above bankfull levels across Boulder, Larimer, and southwest Weld counties.  By the evening of the 12th, flooding continued in many areas and increased in severity. Heavy rain, while not as widespread as the previous day, had a greater impact on stream levels as streams were already elevated and the ground was completely saturated. Two peaks of flows occurred on Boulder Creek near downtown. The peak flow on the evening of September 12th surpassed the 1969 Boulder flood, but initial indications are that it fell short of the 1938 and 1894 floods.  Boulder Stream Gauge ���peak flows occurred near 0100 mdt on the 12th, and 2100 mdt on the 12th.   Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Big Thompson River,  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  The headwaters moved down the South Platte with floodwaters impacted Weld, Morgan, Washington and Logan Counties.  Extensive flooding occurred in and around Greeley, Fort Morgan and Sterling.  Large sections of the counties' roads and highways were washed away, with property and crops completely inundated.   ||After little rainfall on Friday, September 13th, the flash flood threat returned for  Saturday. This time, storms with heavy rainfall were concentrated in Douglas County, but also extended northeast into the Aurora area once again. Up to 3 inches of rain fell in one hour.  Plum Creek and other small creeks and streams flooded, along with significant street flooding.  The last day of this prolonged period of very heavy rainfall was on Sunday, September 15th. Another weak front had pushed through the area Saturday night, leaving the atmosphere unseasonably moist and unstable.  Heavy rain developed by mid morning and then became more widespread and peaked in intensity by the noon hour. This time, flash flooding was most significant in the northern portions of the Denver metro area from Northglenn to around Broomfield. Rain finally tapered off during the late afternoon and evening.||The devastating flood damage encompassed 4,500 square miles of the Colorado Front Range, left seven dead, forced thousands to evacuate, and destroyed thousands of homes and farms. Record amounts of rainfall generated flash floods that tore up roads and lines of communication, leaving many stranded.  Nearly 19,000 homes were damaged, and over 1,500 destroyed.  The Colorado Department of Transportation estimated that at least 30 state highway bridges were destroyed and an additional 20 seriously damaged. A preliminary assessment of the state's infrastructure showed damage of $40 million to roads and $112 million to bridges.  Repair costs for state and and county roads were likely to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Miles of freight and passenger rail lines were washed out or submerged, including a section servicing Amtrak's iconic California Zephyr.  The town of Lyons in Boulder County was isolated by the flooding of St. Vrain Creek, and several earth dams along the Front Range burst or were over-topped.   Floodwaters also swept through Estes Park, the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park and a major tourist attraction, and damaged hundreds of buildings and destroyed large sections of the two main roads that led into town; U.S. 34 from Loveland and U.S. 36 from Lyons/Boulder.  U.S. 34 suffered the most damage, with 85 percent of its roadway and bridges destroyed.   In Weld County, approximately 1,900 gas wells were damaged and had to be closed off as the floodwaters inundated entire communities. ||Sewage treatment plants and other utilities were knocked out in a number of towns,  and standing water left by floods on prairie farmlands posed the threat of significant damage to crops already planted in the region.  Northeast Colorado Health Department has advised with the local CSU Extension office in Logan County regarding local crops and gardens that had been exposed to flood waters.  As the flood waters in our area should be considered contaminated, local crops and gardens may not be considered suitable for human consumption or animal feed.  In the flooded areas, an estimated 23,000 acres of cropland was impacted and stretched from Boulder to Logan Counties and included:  alfalfa, corn, hay, silage and sugar beets.  The estimated loss of production ranged from $3.4 million to $5.5 million. ||Governor Hickenlooper declared a disaster emergency on September 13th, in 11 counties across northeast Colorado including:  Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Boulder, Denver, Jefferson, Larimer, Logan, Morgan, Washington and Weld.  By September 15th, federal emergency declarations covered those counties as well as Clear Creek County.  Projected losses from the flooding statewide was nearly $3 billion in property damage.  Half of the damage estimate was from housing and half from the commercial and government sectors, according to Eqecat, a catastrophe modeling firm; this was the first comprehensive estimate of the disaster's economic toll.  The projected losses for residential property alone were about $900 million.  Another $1 billion was attributed to commercial and goverment property, including roads and bridges.  In addition, more than 11 thousand people were evacuated, reportedly the largest since Hurricane Katrina.  President Obama declared a state of emergency for Boulder and Larimer Counties, with an additional 10 counties added September 16th including: Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Clear Creek, Denver, Jefferson, Morgan, Logan, Washington and Weld Counties.  The president also declared a major disaster specifically for Boulder County, which provided for federal recovery assistance. ||There were six fatalities directly attributed to flash flooding.  By county, those fatalities included 4 in Boulder County and 2 in Larimer County.  Two 19-yr old teenagers died on the evening of the 11th, after they were swept away by floodwaters after abandoning their vehicle on Lindon Drive in Boulder.  In Jamestown, a 72-yr old man was killed when the building he was in collapsed.  An 80-yr old Lyons resident was killed in the early morning hours of the 12th, when his truck was swept into the St. Vrain River near his home.   On the evening of the 12th, a 79-yr old Larimer County resident was killed when she was swept away while trying to climb to safety from her home in Cedar Point.   A 61-yr old Cedar Point resident died when her home was swept down the Big Thompson River by the floodwaters.  An indirect fatality occurred on the 16th.  An 80-yr old Idaho Springs resident drowned in Clear Creek when the embankment he was standing on collapsed.||Along the South Platte River, the crest of the flood at Kersey was near 18.8 feet on September 14th, which was significantly higher than the record crest of 11.73 feet set on May 8, 1973.   On September 15th, the flood crest was near 13.7 feet at Balzac which exceeded the record of 13.3 feet set on June 18, 1965.  On September 18th, the flood crest was at Julesburg was 10.6 feet, which broke the previous record of 10.44 feet set on June 20, 1965.  ||In Boulder, some of the monthly records broken included:  one-day all-time record:  9.08 inches which shattered the previous wettest day of 4.8 inches set on July 31, 1919; one-month record of 18.16 inches, which broke the previous all-time monthly record of 9.59 inches set in May of 1995; wettest September on record which broke the previous record of 5.5 inches set in September of 1940; one-year record of 34.15 inches broke the previous wettest year of 29.93 inches set in 1995.  In Denver, the total precipitation for the month of September was 5.61 inches, which was 4.65 inches above the normal of 0.96 inches. This is the most precipitation ever recorded in Denver for the month of September.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rain continued to produce widespread flash flooding.

A surface trough was the focus of training storms which produced heavy rainfall that led to major flooding across the Onion Creek and Blanco/San Marcos River watersheds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rains in excess of 14 inches upstream of Austin in the Onion Creek Watershed near Wimberley caused a flash flood that hit portions of South Austin in the early morning hours.  Water started to rise and flood portions of the Onion Creek area near Interstate 35 by 4-5am on the morning of the 31st and water continued to rise into the early morning hours.  USGS gauges were overtopped near Twin Creek Road and this record flood water continued to move along Onion creek, passing under I-35 and inundating several neighborhoods between I-35 and US Highway 183.  A reverse 911 was utilized by the City of Austin to help evacuate residents but flood waters rose so quickly that most residents sheltered in place and were rescued by truck and helicopter later that morning.  Those that tried to escape the flood waters via their vehicles got caught in the rising waters and this led to several fatalities.  A mother and infant son died when their SUV vehicle was swept off the Onion Creek bridge on Bluff Springs Road in the predawn hours around 430 am. Another resident in a neighborhood along Onion Creek was also found drowned as his vehicle got swept off the road and was recovered near Pleasant Valley Drive and William Cannon.  Almost 2 weeks later the body of a homeless man was found in Williamson Creek near South First Street and Heartwood.  He was presumed a flood fatality from this event.  Manual readings were performed by USGS at the Onion Creek/Highway 183 gauge site ATIT2.  The creek crested just over 40 feet at 930 am the morning of October 31st.  This was a new record height for this location and translated to about 135,000 cubic feet per second. In total across Travis County and the City of Austin, over 700 homes were damaged by the flooding, of which over 100 were destroyed.  Most of the affected homes did not have insurance and were within the 100 year flood plain of Onion Creek.  Flood recovery lasted for several weeks including debris removal. Damage estimates are still being calculated as of this writing but damages across Travis County and the City of Austin look like they will exceed 100 million dollars.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Most areas received between one and five inches of rainfall with some localized areas receiving up to 20 inches of rainfall in several days. This caused devastating floods and flash floods with some rivers reaching all time record levels. There were several hundred rescues performed and evacuations of over 500 individuals from their homes across the Missouri Ozarks.  Joint agencies from the federal, state, and local assessed over 18 million dollars in damages to property and infrastructure. Over 380 homes and over 130 businesses were damaged due to the floods.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This storm report will be a summary of the total damage for the Waynesville area and  Pulaski County for this flooding event. Approximately 90 percent of the roads in the county were damaged with 65 percent of the roads had major damage. There were 25 low water crossings that were totally washed out and numerous more needed  repairs. There were up to 100 homes and businesses that were inundated by flood waters. Numerous cars were flooded or washed away. Most of the homes flooded were along Mitchell Creek and Rubidoux River near downtown Waynesville. Over 100 people were rescued from swift and high water. There were two flash flood fatalities which occurred near downtown Waynesville.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A squall line developed across southeast Arkansas and moved quickly across north-central Mississippi during the morning, producing multiple reports of damaging winds and ping-pong to golf ball size hail. There were reports of multiple trees blown down, some roofs blown off buildings and wind gusts of 60-80 mph, with a 77 mph wind gust measured at the Columbus AFB surface observing station. A lone supercell moved across southeast Arkansas just after 1:00 pm and showed many indications of very large hail and strong rotation. This storm gradually began making more of a right turn and continued to dive southeast across northeast Louisiana before moving into Mississippi. This storm produced multiple reports of golf ball to baseball size hail as it continued to dive southeast, shattering windows in homes and vehicles. This storm gradually weakened as another storm began to develop just to the southwest over Morehouse Parish. The storm continued to move southeast with the southern edge of the storm beginning to develop supercell characteristics. This storm became the focus of activity as it began rapidly increasing in intensity and showing signs of producing large hail. Ping pong to tennis ball size hail fell as the storm moved into northern Warren County, breaking numerous windows on vehicles near Redwood. Strong winds blew a tree on a house and caused a minor injury near Redwood. The long-lived supercell continued to move into a favorable environment and produced multiple reports of golf ball to baseball size hail along its path as it moved into the Jackson metro area. The largest hailstone was softball size, or 4.25 inches, which fell in Clinton around 3:50 pm, shattering vehicle windshields. One injury occurred in the Pinehaven community near Clinton when a baseball size hailstone fell onto a resident causing head trauma. This supercell continued to move southeast over the downtown Jackson metro area with numerous reports of golf ball to baseball size hail falling all along the path. The large hail from this supercell caused major roof damage, shattered windshields and caused dents in numerous vehicles and siding damage to multiple mobile homes in the Jackson metro area. The squall line in northeastern Mississippi produced an outflow boundary that moved to the south and southeast which would serve as a focus for additional thunderstorm development ahead of the storm moving into western Mississippi. Thunderstorms began increasing in intensity along the outflow boundary and numerous reports of large hail continued in a swath down into southern Mississippi. Reports of golf ball to baseball size hail were received along a line from Seminary to Natchez and a few golf ball size hailstones fell south of Columbia. As the actual cold front finally made its way through the I-20 corridor and south, additional hail fell during the evening. However, this hail was significantly smaller than what fell earlier, with sizes ranging from nickel to quarter size. The thunderstorms gradually moved out of the Pine Belt region late on the evening of the 18th.||An elementary school in Clinton was damaged bad enough to have to close for the remainder of the school year, and many state and local law enforcement vehicles were heavily damaged or totaled. The amount of damages to the Jackson metro area were staggering and will be remembered for years to come. The hailstone that fell in Clinton was the 3rd largest hailstone in March in Mississippi since 1950, only surpassed by a grapefruit size hailstone that fell on March 30th, 1993 in Puckett, MS and on March 6th, 1996 in Laurel, MS. It was also the 7th largest hailstone to fall in Mississippi for any month, with the largest hailstone of 5.0 inches, or CD/DVD size, falling in Lafayette County on April 10th, 1962.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This long lived storm that continued out of Warren County produced golf ball to grapefruit size hail along its path as it moved toward the Jackson metro area. The largest hailstone (4.25 inches in diameter) fell in Clinton around 3:50 pm, shattering vehicle windshields. One injury occurred in the Pinehaven community near Clinton when a baseball size hailstone fell onto a resident causing head trauma. This storm continued to move southeast over the downtown Jackson metro area with numerous reports of golfball to baseball size hail falling all along the path. The large hail from this supercell caused incredible roof damage all across the city, as well as shattering thousands of vehicle windows and windshields, as well as denting thousands of vehicles. Substantial siding damage occurred to multiple mobile homes as well. Large hail fell at Hawkins Field, causing incredible damage to aircraft that were parked on the ramp.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
