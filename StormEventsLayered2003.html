This was along a prefrontal surface boundary, and well out ahead of a strong cold front.  The atmosphere warmed into the 80s with surface dew points in the 70 to 75 degree range.  Additional thunderstorms formed into a broken west to east line across West Virginia, ahead of the squall line.  This caused flooding problems.  After 1500E, the squall line accelerated eastward, moving near 50 mph.  As a result of this event, a few more counties, such as Ritchie and Harrison, were added to FEMA's disaster declaration number 1474.   This federal disaster was initiated during the month of June.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Straight line winds caused localize damage along Avery Street in Parkersburg.  One frame house collapsed and several outbuilding were damaged.  The 3 residents in the collapsed house were injured slightly.  The 11 month son was rescued from under the debris.  One resident on Avery Street described the storm by saying, "It was like a chain saw, just going through the top of the trees with a vacuum.

A woman and her child were driving along Back Valley Road, just south of Georgia Highway 136 near Gass, when a tree broke off some 10 to 15 feet above the ground and fell on their minivan.  The child was trapped in the vehicle and had to be rescued. Both received injuries from the incident.  A third person was trapped in his vehicle at a MAPCO gasoline service station in Trenton when the awning from the station was ripped loose from the building, pinning the man in his vehicle.  Although the man had to be rescued from his vehicle, he did not suffer any injuries.  Along Georgia Highway 136 near Gass, west of Trenton, a fruit and vegetable stand suffered extensive damage.  The facade of the main building of the business was destroyed. A secondary building, including its contents, was completely destroyed, and a carport structure, that was also part of the facility, was thrown across the highway by thunderstorm winds.  Next door at a service station, one of the gasoline pumps was damaged,  two windows were broken, and some of the goods inside were knocked over and damaged or destroyed.  Behind the service station, a lumber and salvage yard also suffered damage from the thunderstorm winds.  Metal was blown through the front door and some materials stacked up outside were either damaged or blown away.  Although there were reports of funnel clouds and tornadoes in the area, the Dade Emergency Manager detected no rotation in the damage area and concluded that the damage was caused by a microburst, not a tornado.  He indicated that the damage area was one-half to one mile long and all mostly within a 100 yard wide area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In the town of Dixon, strong winds blew roofs off homes that hit and damaged the Old Dixon Store. As the storms moved through Lake County, wind damage was reported from Ronan to the southern end of Flathead Lake. Strong winds at the Ronan Airport caused the ropes to break off a Cessna 150, which careened into a Cessna 172, damaging both airplanes. Trees were reported uprooted near Finley Point and Polson, leaving at least two houses damaged from fallen trees. Strong wind gusts tore off part of the face of the Old Mill Place along Main Street in Polson, damaging a vehicle. 10 miles west of Polson, a small barn was blown over in Irvine Flats. Before the storms weakened in Flathead County, a twelve inchdiameter tree was blown over near Big Fork, damaging a home owners fence.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Lifted indices were in the -10 to -15 C. range as the low level jet began to strengthen during the nighttime hours.  A cold front to the northwest of the state began to sink southeast into Iowa as weak low pressure moved northeast along the front.  An MCS formed near the triple point of the low and the cold front, then tracked east across northern Iowa during the early morning hours.  Scattered thunderstorms formed south of the MCS, however most of them did not produce severe weather.  As the system evolved it took on a bow echo configuration as it raced across the state.  Numerous locations reported winds of 55 to 70 MPH along the path of the storm.  Trees were blown down in many locations.  There were no reports of widespread significant damage however.  The storms moved east of the state by sunrise.  One brief tornado touchdown was reported in a field just east of Mason City.  The tornado only touched the ground before lifting and caused no damage.  One person was injured as the storms moved through the area.  High winds toppled trees in the Clear Lake area.  One of the trees fell on a woman in a tent, pinning here and causing minor injuries.  She was taken to the hospital and received 11 stitches for a head injury.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A rain-wrapped tornado was sighted in western Valley county shortly after 7:30 pm by several storm chasers.  The tornado blasted 2 farmsteads, one of which was abandoned.  A total of 14 outbuildings were damaged or destroyed.  The tornado was in the far western part of Valley county along the Comstock road.  Another brief tornado was reported near Arcadia a short time later but no damage was confirmed.Elsewhere, vicious high winds over 70 mph did extensive damage north of Shelby in eastern Polk county.  Several farmsteads sustained house, outbuilding, grain bin and tree damage.  In one case, a garage was nearly ripped from the house it was attached to.  Twenty four center pivot irrigation systems were severely damaged or destroyed.  A semi-tractor trailer was overturned as the high winds approached.  The driver was unhurt but a passenger sustained minor injuries and was treated at a nearby hospital.  At one point, 4,500 customers were without power in the area.  The high winds also pounded the Palmer area about an hour earlier that night.  On a farm north of Palmer, a roof was torn from a metal building, a garage destroyed and a large goose neck trailer tossed several feet by the wind.  The damage was strewn across a nearby corn field.Finally, hail caused crop and property damage in parts of the area.  The St. Libory area sustained the worst damage with hail stones the size of baseballs and larger were reported.  Siding and windows were heavily damaged on many homes, especially just north of town.  Crop damage was fairly extensive along a narrow path in the same area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Nearly 18,000 customers in D.C. lost power as a direct result of the storm.  The 76 MPH wind gust was recorded at Johnson Junior High School and a wind gust of 63 MPH was recorded at Charles Hart Middle School. An apartment complex on Morris Road SE sustained significant roof and window damage.  Two people were injured and 25 people were displaced by the debris. A downed power line nearby caught three cars on fire.  On Alabama Avenue SE, trees were felled onto houses.  On Suitland Parkway and Staunton Road SE, a tree fell on a deck and trees blocked the road. At Seventh Street and Raleigh Place SE, a tree was felled onto a 2-story home and an elderly couple was trapped inside. On Jay Street NE, an apartment building roof and windows were damaged and several trees were downed.  A 2 month old baby and a woman were injured. A total of 46 families were displaced by the damage. Very heavy downpours also caused Rhode Island Avenue to be closed by high water.  In addition, power outages caused three pumping stations to shut down, leading to basement flooding in Northeast.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Winds up to 76 MPH damaged several buildings, and downed numerous trees and power lines.

CAPE values were close to 4000 J/kg, though the airmass was quite capped with 700 mb temperatures around +12 C.  A cold front was weakening as it approached from the north.  The front itself did not make it into Iowa until the morning of the 26th, however thunderstorms that fired along the front the previous night formed an outflow boundary across Iowa by the morning of the 25th.  By the evening of the 25th, the boundary had lifted north into the central part of the state  Thunderstorms fired along the boundary and also formed into an area of relative weakening of the cap over southeast Iowa.  There were several reported microburst events during the night.  One of the most destructive was over Story County, in Story City, where several hundred trees were toppled by the high winds.  Damage was reported to 47 homes in and around the city as well.  Most of the damage was minor.  Three businesses were also affected.   Power was knocked out in some places for up to 36 hours.  Between 3:30-3:45 a.m. on August 26, 2003, a swath of downburst winds struck Story City, Iowa and nearby farms.  A National Weather Service damage survey indicated that the path of wind damage was about one mile wide, with the strongest winds probably occurring within Story City.  The path of continuous tree damage was about 10 miles long, starting about 5 miles west of Story City near the Story/Boone county line.  The damage path was mainly north of highway E18, and then east of Story City it followed highway E15 for about 3 miles.  There was one injury as a semi-tractortrailer truck was overturned.  The driver was pinned and ended up taken to the hospital.  Three poultry confinement buildings and a grain bin were destroyed in the Story City area.   Elsewhere, high winds overturned a semi-tractortrailer truck in Davis County.  There were numerous reports of trees and power lines down from northwest, into central, and southeast Iowa.  A few reports of hail were received, but the largest hail was only an inch and one quarter in diameter.  That fell northeast of St. Anthony in Marshall County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 37K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Repetitive showers formed, as dew points of 60 to 65 degrees fed the system from Kentucky.  The heaviest rain rates came toward the end of this prolong period, mainly from 1530E to 1730E, with rates peaking around an inch per hour.  South of the training showers, across Logan and Mingo Counties, the heavy rain was more sudden, the result of the last shot of enhanced rain during the late afternoon.  The heaviest rain totals ran west to east, from Wayne County and southern Cabell County, through northern Lincoln County, central Kanawha County, southern Clay County, and into central Nicholas County.  Branchland's rain total was 4.7 inches.  Hamlin measured 4.4 inches.  The National Weather Service office at Ruthdale had 4.1 inches.  Mount Nebo measured 3.8 inches.  The 3.66 inches at Charleston was the 5th heaviest 24 hour total on record, for any month of the year.   Richwood observed 3.4 inches.  Clendenin and Clay both measured around 3.1 inches.          Severe flooding occurred along streams feeding into the Mud River in Lincoln County, including the Straight Fork.  Homes and businesses around Hamlin were also flooded.  Damage assessment In Lincoln County counted 35 homes destroyed, 80 with major damage, and 80 with minor damage.  The Griffithsville Elementary School was flooded and sustained heavy damage.  It was closed and will not likely reopen.  Duval High School had minor damage.  There were about 20 swift water rescues in the Duval area.  One rescue was an unusual example.  An Army National Guard black hawk helicopter was in the air, practicing night rescues near Parkersburg.  When the request came in for help, the crew raced 65 miles south to Lincoln County and rescued 3 people from a flooded truck.   The Griffithsville Post Office had several feet of water inside.In Kanawha County, one of the hardest hit drainages was Davis Creek, which flows from Kanawha State Forest through Loudendale to South Charleston.  The main branch of Davis Creek, plus its Middle Fork were hit harder, compared to its Trace Fork.  One Loudendale resident said, "It's flooded, but never this bad."  Some homes had 3 feet of water inside.  A 62 year old male drove into the flooded creek around 2000E on the 12th.  Apparently, he had stopped his car for about 5 minutes in the road, since the local fire department had the road barricaded.  Then, it appeared the man was going to turn around in a parking lot, but instead drove between a house and a small store, and into the swollen creek.  His body was recovered the next day, inside the vehicle, about a miles down the stream.  Two South Charleston firefighters rescued a woman along Davis Creek.  One firefighter said, "She was hanging onto a tree limb.  She was hanging on for dear life.  The only thing sticking out of the water was her head and her arm."   Other flooded areas in Kanawha County included Campbells Creek, Georges Creek at Malden, Witcher Creek and Winifrede hollow, plus the Rabol-Broundland-Olcott Roads.  Inside the city limits of Charleston, a woman was rescued after having her body pinned by flood waters against the lip of a culvert.  This occurred along Lick Branch and South Ruffner Road.  The city emergency director described the street as a "rushing river."   In Kanawha County, 44 homes were destroyed, 150 had major damage, and 88 homes had minor damage.   Several private bridges were also destroyed.The crest on the Mud River in Cabell County occurred around 1300E on the 13th, flooding homes and businesses in Milton.  Milton Middle School was damaged.  Damage assessment counted 8 homes destroyed with major damage to 52 and minor damage to 56 dwellings.                     Further east, in Webster and Nicholas Counties, numerous roads were flooded, but damage to homes was less.  Yet, this rain event would set up the town of Richwood and much of this area, for more severe flooding a week later.In Wayne County, most of the damage was in the Dunlow area.  In Logan County, Garrett Fork and the Sharples area flooded.  In Mingo County, the East Fork of Twelvepole Creek saw flooding.  Besides the flood on the Mud River, the Coal and Elk Rivers saw minor flooding.  Crests on the Elk and Coal Rivers would be even higher the following week.This event initiated a federal disaster.  See FEMA disaster #1500.  More counties would be added to the declaration, after the flooding on the 19th into the 20th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 6.6M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The worst damage occurred along Highway 26 east of DeRidder, where two mobile homes were flipped over. Debris was strewn for over a half mile. One person was injured after he was thrown from the mobile home. In the Longacre community, a family of 4 climbed into a homemade storm cellar, moments before the tornado destroyed their home. They received minro bumps and brusies when the roof of the storm cellar lifted off and debris landed on them.

In addition to these tornadoes, a major flood developed over Harris and surrounding counties during the middle of this tornadic outbreak. Over 300 homes, along with hundreds of vehicles, were flooded.These tornadic storms developed over parts of Wharton and Matagorda counties shortly after sunrise with the first confirmed tornado occurring just east of El Campo around 9:00 am. Strong 500mb upper level troughing over the western U.S. moved from west to east across the Southern Plains. The polar jet stream associated with this 500 millibar trough surged into west Texas and then curved sharply northeastward into the Central Plains. The sub-tropical jet stream was oriented west to east across deep southern Texas. This jet stream pattern was the impetus to strong lower level convergence due to the enhanced upper level divergence. Low level moisture had substantially increased and was about 200 percent of normal by 6 AM. Vertical wind profiles also showed a great deal of low level wind shear with the greatest shear occurring in the lowest 2000 feet. In addition, these veering wind speeds rapidly increased with height. A focus for the thunderstorm development was provided by a weak low level boundary which was aligned southwest to northeast, or generally along the U.S. Highway 59 corridor. This feature was nearly-stationary and thunderstorms repeatedly developed and moved along this boundary. The axis of heaviest rain was coincident with this boundary.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Tornado sighted by personnel in a large plant nursery.

In addition to these tornadoes, a major flood developed over Harris and surrounding counties during the middle of this tornadic outbreak. Over 300 homes, along with hundreds of vehicles, were flooded.These tornadic storms developed over parts of Wharton and Matagorda counties shortly after sunrise with the first confirmed tornado occurring just east of El Campo around 9:00 am. Strong 500mb upper level troughing over the western U.S. moved from west to east across the Southern Plains. The polar jet stream associated with this 500 millibar trough surged into west Texas and then curved sharply northeastward into the Central Plains. The sub-tropical jet stream was oriented west to east across deep southern Texas. This jet stream pattern was the impetus to strong lower level convergence due to the enhanced upper level divergence. Low level moisture had substantially increased and was about 200 percent of normal by 6 AM. Vertical wind profiles also showed a great deal of low level wind shear with the greatest shear occurring in the lowest 2000 feet. In addition, these veering wind speeds rapidly increased with height. A focus for the thunderstorm development was provided by a weak low level boundary which was aligned southwest to northeast, or generally along the U.S. Highway 59 corridor. This feature was nearly-stationary and thunderstorms repeatedly developed and moved along this boundary. The axis of heaviest rain was coincident with this boundary.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Tornado sighted by personnel in a large plant nursery.

The Pelahatchie Creek experienced a 100 year flood. The Chunky River, at Chunky, set a new record. This river actually flooded a portion of Interstate 20 which had to be closed for a few hours. The Chickasawhay River at Enterprise also set a record. In addition to all the flash flooding, the river flooding caused major damage to homes and flooded numerous roads.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado started 4 miles SE of Caseyville and continued to the NE for 10 miles when it entered Copiah county at 7:46 pm, at the intersection of Interstate 55 and the county line. This tornado caused minor damage to numerous homes with several homes sustaining major damage in the form of having their roofs blown off. This tornado also took down two 500 kilowatt towers. In addition to the structural damage, hundereds of trees were snapped and uprooted.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Estimated winds of 210 MPH disintegrated mobile homes and levelled several modern frame homes. One frame house was swept clean off its foundation, with only the roof left intact in a creek about 200 yards away. Many vehicles were lifted, rolled, or thrown up to 100 yards or more. Numerous cases of missiling were observed, including glass embedded in trees. Tree destruction in forested areas was nearly complete, and a few trees were debarked. The only fatality in Massac County was a 65-year-old female who was killed when her mobile home disintegrated. The official cause of death was blunt trauma to the head. She was found in a water-filled ravine about 100 yards from the former site of her mobile home. The frame of the mobile home was wrapped around the trunks of two trees that were stripped of all their limbs. Most of the levelled frame homes were concentrated on Boaz Road and Rolling Hills Road, in or near Hillerman. After passing through Hillerman, the tornado overturned dozens of railroad cars of a train just west of the Mermet Lake Conservation Area, which is off U.S. Route 45. The Mermet Lake Conservation Area was extensively damaged. An estimated 300 acres of forest were destroyed, boat docks were destroyed, and bathing facilities were destroyed. Dozens of waterfowl were found dead. After destroying additional residences and high tension power lines, the tornado crossed Interstate 24 near mile marker 28, about a mile south of the New Columbia exit. Tractor-trailer rigs and a tour bus were overturned on the interstate, injuring the drivers. The interstate was closed due to grain bins, tree limbs, and some building debris on the highway. Additional residences were destroyed between the interstate and the Pope County line. The tornado crossed into Pope County near where Illinois Route 145 crosses the county line. In Massac County, a total of 15 single-family houses and 13 mobile homes were destroyed. About 20 other single-family houses and 15 mobile homes received major damage. Several dozen other residences had some type of minor damage. Numerous vehicles and farming implements were destroyed, including combines. About 20 persons were injured in Massac County, but only one or two were hospitalized in serious or critical condition. Most of the injuries involved lacerations, bruises, broken bones, and internal injuries. Near Hillerman, a deputy sheriff escaped unhurt after his patrol car was thrown about 50 yards and struck by a flying tree and telephone pole.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The storm produced a 33-mile long tornado that killed two and injured about 33. A small but very damaging downburst occurred several miles  south of the tornado track.  A swath of large hail occurred north of the tornado track. Hailstones up to 2 inches in diameter were reported at and near the intersection of Highways 145 and 147, near the community of Glendale in Pope County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado was near its maximum F-4 intensity as it crossed the Pulaski County line into western Massac County near the community of Hillerman. Estimated winds of 210 MPH disintegrated mobile homes and levelled several modern frame homes. One frame house was swept clean off its foundation, with only the roof left intact in a creek about 200 yards away. Many vehicles were lifted, rolled, or thrown up to 100 yards or more. Numerous cases of missiling were observed, including glass embedded in trees. Tree destruction in forested areas was nearly complete, and a few trees were debarked.

One storm near Aurora produced very large hail.  One stone measured by an NWS Storm Survey team was determined to be the largest sized stone to fall in the United States.  It measured 7 inches in diameter and 18.75 inches in circumference.  Many other large stones were noted on the northern side of Aurora.  Given the lack of wind, damage was limited to roofs, a few windows and some crop land near town.  The storm also produced a couple of brief small tornadoes as it slowly moved through northern Hamilton county.At nearly the same time, another very slow moving storm produced several tornadoes, hail and extremely heavy rains in Thayer county. One tornado moved through the town of Deshler going from the southeast side of town to the west.  One man was killed in his garage before he was able to get to shelter.  Over 400 homes in Deshler were damaged with four being completely demolished.  Nearly 100 homes were moderately to severely damaged.  Six businesses in town were considered a complete loss and 25 others reportedly suffered moderate to severe damage.  Seven people were injured, most were minor and were from broken glass.  Later in the evening, a tornado was reported north of Bradshaw in York county.  Storm spotters about 1 mile west of the tornado saw debris being flung through the air.  A farmstead was hit with most of the damage done to an old barn.Despite ongoing drought conditions, widespread flooding was reported in Thayer and southern Fillmore counties.  The flash flood along the Rose Creek at Hubbell provided some of the worst damage.  Water was flowing into houses and businesses on main street to the tune of up to 5 feet deep.  Boats were the only mode of travel through the business district.  Up to 15 residents had to be evacuated by the local Dive and Rescue team using jet skis.  The flooding was caused by extremely heavy rainfall in nearby Republic County, Kansas.Flooding and flash flooding was also a problem throughout Thayer county.  Rainfall of over 12 inches was reported about 5 miles north of Deshler.  Residents reported nearly 5 hours of constant, wind-driven rain.  Windows were blown out and the rain just poured into homes.  Widespread agricultural damage was done due to the rain.  The runoff in the Snake and Spring creeks ravaged Deshler, the town which had already been hammered by tornadoes that evening.  Flooding was concentrated in the southern part of town and most widespread near the park and fairgrounds.Major river flooding was reported along the Little Blue River from just west of Hebron to the Jefferson county line.  One man at his farmstead near Gilead had to be air lifted to safety by the National Guard as flooding waters rose on his property.  Dozens of county roads and bridges were damaged or destroyed.  U. S. Highway 81 was restricted to one lane travel at Hebron due to the high water on the road.  Portions of Highways 81, 136 and 9 were closed for a time due to high water.  The Big Sandy Creek flowed out of its banks at Alexandria and crested at 14.5 feet.  Water was flowing over the highway near town and filling back into the town's sewer drains.  In all, several million dollars in damage was done by the flooding alone.  Some locals said this was the worst flooding in the area in 55 years.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A strong tornado set down on the southeast side of Deshler near the fairgrounds and moved west through the south side of Deshler.

The tornado moved across Highway 64 where several homes and businesses were destroyed with a number of other buildings suffering significant damage.  Two tractor-trailers traveling along Highway 64 were hit by the tornado and overturned.  The drivers of both vehicles suffered minor injuries.  As the tornado continued moving to the northeast, numerous other homes and other buildings were either damaged or destroyed.  A number of vehicles were also damaged or destroyed.  Widespread trees and power poles were blown down along the track of the tornado.

Numerous reports of large hail and a few reports of strong winds were received. In addition 12 tornadoes were reported (discussed separately), some doing considerable damage. Four funnel clouds were also sighted. May 8, 2003,  was estimated to be the most significant and widespread tornado outbreak in northeast Kansas since April 26, 1991. All meteorological severe weather forecast parameters came together over northeast Kansas on the afternoon of May 8 to produce an SPC "high risk" area of potential severe weather. The possibility of strong, long-lived destructive tornadoes was highlighted for nearly 24 hours in advance in nearly every NWS statement and product. The significant and widespread tornado outbreak in the nearby Kansas City area just four days before increased public weather awareness and concern, and together with timely watches, statements and warnings, helped prevent tornado related deaths and minimized storm injuries.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado touched down in the southwest part of Lawrence and did considerable damage to the area.

One supercell produced three tornadoes that affected Moore, southern Oklahoma City, Midwest City, and Choctaw. A few locations in Moore and southeast Oklahoma City had also been hit by an F5 tornado that moved through the area on May 3, 1999. The General Motors Plant in southeast Oklahoma City sustained some of the most significant damage. This event was the second tornadic event of the day. Several tornadoes moved across south central Oklahoma during the early morning hours of May 8th (refer to appropriate data). This event was also the first of two days in a row where the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area was affected by tornadoes (refer to May 9, 2003 data). These thunderstorms developed near and along a strong dryline located across central Oklahoma.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the first segment of a tornado that began in Cleveland County and moved into Oklahoma County before dissipating 2.5 miles south-southeast of Choctaw. The tornado began in the area of Northwest 5th Street and Santa Fe Avenue in Moore, near the Church of Latter Day Saints. Damage intensities increased quickly to F2 and isolated F3 as the tornado, initially narrow, moved east along 5th street. Substantial structural damage in this initial touchdown area was confined to homes on the north side of 5th Street, just east of Santa Fe. Homes on the south side of 5th, and those on 6th Street one block to the north, were relatively undamaged.The damage track then widened quickly to nearly one-fifth of a mile as the tornado turned more to the northeast through residential areas, crossing Markwell Avenue between North 2nd and North 7th Streets. The most significant damage on Markwell, rated F2, was at North 6th Street. Continuing northeast and widening to nearly a quarter of a mile, the tornado crossed Janeway Avenue between Dillon Avenue (south edge) and 12th Street (north edge). Maximum damage on Janeway was to homes near 8th Street, and was rated F2.Damage intensity increased to F3 as the tornado approached 12th Street between Janeway and Interstate 35. A commercial building on the south side of 12th suffered F3 damage, as did several homes on the north side of 12th Street at City Avenue where several homes lost most of their outside walls. Maximum damage intensity on Sunrise Avenue (north of 12th and one block east of City Ave.) was rated strong F2 and consisted mostly of homes being partially or totally unroofed. Several vehicles were tossed into front yards, and in one case nearly into the front of a home.The worst damage produced within the city of Moore was as the tornado approached west sides of Interstate 35, just north of 12th Street. Damage in this area included major damage to two hotels, the First Christian Church, the Young Child Development Center, a Project Headstart building, an office building, and several restaurants. The church, child care center, and office building were leveled. The two hotels, both two-story, had their second floors partially or totally removed by the tornado. At least a half dozen vehicles were tossed in this area, with evidence suggesting that some of them may have traveled 100 yards or more. Had the leveled buildings here shown evidence of better construction, damage might have been rated F4. As it was, damage here was rated strong F3.A southbound moving Greyhound bus was hit by the tornado as it crossed Interstate 35. The bus was carrying twenty-three passengers, some of which chose to disembark to take cover in a ditch while others chose to stay on the bus. The bus rolled several times jostling passengers around the interior. Passengers were trapped between crushed seats and buckled walls while others were left hanging upside down and out broken windows. Of those that hid in the ditch, eleven were injured by flying debris. Eight passengers that stayed on the bus were also injured. Most of the injuries to the passengers were minor.The tornado crossed Interstate 35 0.25 to 0.50 miles north of 12th Street, damaging or destroying several businesses along Broadway, just east of the interstate. Intensity dropped to F2 in this area, but the path width remained close to a quarter of a mile. The tornado continued northeast across south and east parts of the Highland Park residential area, causing F1 and spotty F2 damage. The tornado weakened to F1 intensity and turned slightly to the north-northeast as it crossed Pole Road and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad tracks near and just south of Northeast 27th Street.It should be noted that the damage track of this tornado through Moore was nearly parallel to, and generally a quarter of a mile or less south of, the track of the F5 tornado that struck Moore on 3 May 1999. In fact, Highland Park also suffered extensive damage from the May 3rd tornado, but that damage was mainly in the north and west parts of the area. The damage track through Highland Park on 8 May 2003 was roughly two blocks farther south.The tornado crossed Northeast 27th between Pole Road and Eastern Avenue and continued northeast, crossing Eastern at the Lakeside Golf Course, just east of Eastern and straddling the Oklahoma City and Moore city limits. This golf course also took a direct hit from the tornado on 3 May 1999, and from this point northeastward for about one mile, the two tornado tracks overlapped. The tornado, at this point F1, continued northeast from the golf course into an open field just south of Southeast 89th Street, then struck the northwest part of a subdivision just south of 89th Street and west of Bryant Avenue. More than a dozen residences, including duplexes and single-family homes, were heavily damaged or destroyed in this area. The same northwest part of this subdivision was hit hard on 3 May 1999; many of the homes damaged or destroyed on 8 May had been rebuilt and were less than four years old.This tornado continued into Oklahoma County becoming an F4 and traveling a total of 17.3 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 210M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Over twelve witnesses observed the tornado along the leading edge of the bowing squall line as they saw debris tossed several hundred feet into the air. The tornado traveled east  southeast along Forest Blvd and West Lincoln Avenue. Three house trailers were severely damaged by the tornado between 85th and Black Lane. Two injuries occurred in two of the three house trailers.  Numerous large trees were severed or downed by the tornado. The roof of a large machine shed on Black Lane was uplifted and displaced several hundred yards to the east.  The tornado then ripped through an auto salvage area where several vehicles were over-turned, damaged or destroyed.  The width of this damage area was 50 to 100 yards wide while damage intensity was rated F1. The tornado continued to travel just a bit south of due east causing damage to two homes and a camper and completely destroying another mobile home. Some of the remains of the mobile home was observed 3/4 mile to the east just west of Highway 157. Pieces of metal were wrapped around snapped power poles while one 2 x 4 board was driven into the front windshield of a pickup truck. The width of this damage area varied from 50 to 75 yards while the damage intensity was rated low-end F2.  The tornado continued east and showed a convergence pattern in a nearby wheat field south of West Lincoln Ave. The tornado then caused minor damage to six new homes 100 to 300 yards south of West Lincoln Ave and 1/4 to 1/2 mile west of Highway 159. Roofs from five homes were partially uplifted and tossed 200 to 400 yards downwind to the east.  One home under construction was completely destroyed. The width of the damage area varied from 75 to 150 yards. The damage intensity was rated the lower end of F1. The tornado continued east up a ridge just east of Highway 157. Several large trees were snapped or uprooted just east of 157. Additional tree damage was found along Hill Road east of Highway 157. One home on Hill Road sustained minor roof damage. The tornado crossed East O'Fallon Drive and severed or uprooted several large trees. One home sustained minor roof damage while a machine shed and garage was severely damaged. The tornado damage track ended just west of Highway 159.

Over twelve witnesses observed the tornado along the leading edge of the bowing squall line as they saw debris tossed several hundred feet into the air. The tornado traveled east  southeast along Forest Blvd and West Lincoln Avenue. Three house trailers were severely damaged by the tornado between 85th and Black Lane. Two injuries occurred in two of the three house trailers.  Numerous large trees were severed or downed by the tornado. The roof of a large machine shed on Black Lane was uplifted and displaced several hundred yards to the east.  The tornado then ripped through an auto salvage area where several vehicles were over-turned, damaged or destroyed.  The width of this damage area was 50 to 100 yards wide while damage intensity was rated F1. The tornado continued to travel just a bit south of due east causing damage to two homes and a camper and completely destroying another mobile home. Some of the remains of the mobile home was observed 3/4 mile to the east just west of Highway 157. Pieces of metal were wrapped around snapped power poles while one 2 x 4 board was driven into the front windshield of a pickup truck. The width of this damage area varied from 50 to 75 yards while the damage intensity was rated low-end F2.  The tornado continued east and showed a convergence pattern in a nearby wheat field south of West Lincoln Ave. The tornado then caused minor damage to six new homes 100 to 300 yards south of West Lincoln Ave and 1/4 to 1/2 mile west of Highway 159. Roofs from five homes were partially uplifted and tossed 200 to 400 yards downwind to the east.  One home under construction was completely destroyed. The width of the damage area varied from 75 to 150 yards. The damage intensity was rated the lower end of F1. The tornado continued east up a ridge just east of Highway 157. Several large trees were snapped or uprooted just east of 157. Additional tree damage was found along Hill Road east of Highway 157. One home on Hill Road sustained minor roof damage. The tornado crossed East O'Fallon Drive and severed or uprooted several large trees. One home sustained minor roof damage while a machine shed and garage was severely damaged. The tornado damage track ended just west of Highway 159.  Width of the damage area again varied from 75 to 100 yards while the damage intensity was rated at the lower end of F1.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One supercell produced three tornadoes that affected Moore, southern Oklahoma City, Midwest City, and Choctaw. A few locations in Moore and southeast Oklahoma City had also been hit by an F5 tornado that moved through the area on May 3, 1999. The General Motors Plant in southeast Oklahoma City sustained some of the most significant damage. This event was the second tornadic event of the day. Several tornadoes moved across south central Oklahoma during the early morning hours of May 8th (refer to appropriate data). This event was also the first of two days in a row where the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area was affected by tornadoes (refer to May 9, 2003 data). These thunderstorms developed near and along a strong dryline located across central Oklahoma.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the final segment of a tornado that moved east-northeast from Cleveland County, 1.5 miles west-northwest of Moore, into Oklahoma County crossing the county line at Southeast 89th Street. The western edge of the damage path along SE 89th Street was about halfway between Eastern Avenue and Bryant Avenue and the eastern edge of the damage path was just east of Bryant Avenue. As the tornado approached Sunnylane Road, it produced significant damage to a manufacturing and distribution plant just west of Sunnylane along Southeast 85th Street. Six people were in the plant when the tornado struck, but were able to seek shelter in a safe room and nobody was injured at the plant. The manufacturing part of the complex was a large, free-span structure that was destroyed. The adjoining office part of the complex to the south was a brick structure that received significant damage to the exterior walls. To the east of the plant along the east side of Sunnylane Road, a car was flipped over. Between Sunnylane Road and Sooner Road, the tornado traveled through an open area narrowly missing a residential area. But as it crossed Sooner Road, it damaged or destroyed a number of businesses including a convenience store and a bank to the south of Interstate 240.The tornado continued east-northeast crossing Interstate 240 and Southeast 74th Street. Along SE 74th, a number of businesses received significant damage including a storage facility, a boat dealership, a Mary Kay Training Center, and a trucking company.Crossing Air Depot Boulevard, the tornado moved onto the property of the General Motors Corporation Assembly Plant causing significant (F4) damage to the plant. A newly built paint shop sustained the heaviest damage exposing equipment and new production parts to the weather. The body shop, power house, and a couple of cooling tanks also sustained significant damage. The stack of one of the boilers was also sheared off. More than 600 newly assembled sport utility vehicles parked outside the plant were damaged or destroyed. Approximately 100 employee vehicles were also damaged with one compact car being flipped vertically and wedged into the side of the paint shop. Two truck drivers making deliveries to the plant sustained minor injuries. However, the more than one thousand plant employees remained uninjured by moving to shelter well before the tornado struck. The nearby United Auto Workers Union headquarters was also heavily damaged in this area.The tornado moved into the southeast section of Tinker Air Force Base, including the south part of the runway complex. An ammunition storage bunker and a guard shack at the gate near Southeast 59th Street and Douglas Boulevard were heavily damaged. The guards and other personnel were able to seek shelter in an underground shelter. After crossing Douglas Boulevard, the tornado continued to slowly veer to the northeast and damaged homes along Berryman Road. The tornado continued to damage homes and downing trees and power lines. Strong F2 to F3 damage was observed on the west side of Post Road to the south of Southeast 44th Street.A number of homes were significantly damaged or destroyed in the north part of the Kennington neighborhood, which is located southeast of Southeast 44th Street and Post Road. Two homes in the north part of the neighborhood were completely destroyed consistent with F4 damage. One of these was a two story home with no roof or walls remaining. Two cars from the garage of a residence on the west side of Kennington Lane were found about 50 yards to the east. Another home farther east was destroyed, although walls remained intact. Other homes were severely damaged. The tornado continued across SE 44th Street and Interstate 40 and went into a residential area just west of Westminister Road. Homes were damaged on Newey Avenue, Randy Street, and Rowlett Avenue with the most significant damage near the intersection of Randy Street and Rowlett Avenue where house damage consistent with an F3 rating was observed. The tornado was likely a multiple-vortex tornado in this area as some of the damage in this area was inconsistent with a single cyclonic rotation.The tornado crossed Westminister Road and damaged more homes along Burning Oaks Drive. F3 damage occurred to a few homes along Burning Oaks Drive between Westminister and Twisted Oaks Drive. To the northeast, homes in another residential area on Southeast 32nd Street were significantly damaged and a number of large trees were also downed. Damage continued to the northeast crossing Anderson Road and Southeast 29th Street moving into the city of Midwest City. There were no known structures to hit as the tornado traveled northeast from near SE 29th and Anderson Road to Hiwassee Road. Significant tree damage was observed and one structure was damaged (F1) along Hiwassee Road just to the south of Southeast 15th Street. A large number of power poles and large trees were downed along SE 15th Street to the east of Hiwassee.To the north of Southeast 15th Street, the tornado moved into the "Hidden Valley" residential area of the city of Choctaw. The only known injury in Choctaw occurred where a woman suffered a broken leg as one home on Hidden Valley Lane was destroyed (F4). Two homes under construction were also destroyed. The tornado was narrower in this area. Other homes in the neighborhood were damaged along Willow Drive, Hummingbird Drive, and Kingbird Drive. In eastern portions of the neighborhood, significant tree damage continued, although there was no significant structural damage. The tornado turned more to the east-northeast again and crossed Henney Road and approached Choctaw Road near Southeast 10th Street where more homes were damaged. The tornado weakened as it moved east-northeast and dissipated southwest of Indian Meridian Road and Reno Avenue.This tornado carved a total path of 17.3 miles moving across the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area with the most significant damage (F4) occurring in Oklahoma County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 160M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

After crossing Douglas Boulevard, the tornado continued to slowly veer to the northeast and damaged homes along Berryman Road. The tornado continued to damage homes and downing trees and power lines. Strong F2 to F3 damage was observed on the west side of Post Road to the south of Southeast 44th Street.A number of homes were significantly damaged or destroyed in the north part of the Kennington neighborhood, which is located southeast of Southeast 44th Street and Post Road. Two homes in the north part of the neighborhood were completely destroyed consistent with F4 damage. One of these was a two story home with no roof or walls remaining. Two cars from the garage of a residence on the west side of Kennington Lane were found about 50 yards to the east. Another home farther east was destroyed, although walls remained intact. Other homes were severely damaged. The tornado continued across SE 44th Street and Interstate 40 and went into a residential area just west of Westminister Road. Homes were damaged on Newey Avenue, Randy Street, and Rowlett Avenue with the most significant damage near the intersection of Randy Street and Rowlett Avenue where house damage consistent with an F3 rating was observed. The tornado was likely a multiple-vortex tornado in this area as some of the damage in this area was inconsistent with a single cyclonic rotation.The tornado crossed Westminister Road and damaged more homes along Burning Oaks Drive. F3 damage occurred to a few homes along Burning Oaks Drive between Westminister and Twisted Oaks Drive. To the northeast, homes in another residential area on Southeast 32nd Street were significantly damaged and a number of large trees were also downed. Damage continued to the northeast crossing Anderson Road and Southeast 29th Street moving into the city of Midwest City. There were no known structures to hit as the tornado traveled northeast from near SE 29th and Anderson Road to Hiwassee Road. Significant tree damage was observed and one structure was damaged (F1) along Hiwassee Road just to the south of Southeast 15th Street. A large number of power poles and large trees were downed along SE 15th Street to the east of Hiwassee.To the north of Southeast 15th Street, the tornado moved into the "Hidden Valley" residential area of the city of Choctaw. The only known injury in Choctaw occurred where a woman suffered a broken leg as one home on Hidden Valley Lane was destroyed (F4). Two homes under construction were also destroyed. The tornado was narrower in this area. Other homes in the neighborhood were damaged along Willow Drive, Hummingbird Drive, and Kingbird Drive. In eastern portions of the neighborhood, significant tree damage continued, although there was no significant structural damage. The tornado turned more to the east-northeast again and crossed Henney Road and approached Choctaw Road near Southeast 10th Street where more homes were damaged. The tornado weakened as it moved east-northeast and dissipated southwest of Indian Meridian Road and Reno Avenue.This tornado carved a total path of 17.3 miles moving across the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area with the most significant damage (F4) occurring in Oklahoma County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 160M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Most damage was in the F0 category to trees and roof shingles. Several pockets of F1 damage were noted embedded within the path, indicative of possible multiple-vortices. Most structures that received F1 damage were structures with susceptibilities to high wind. These included several churches, a self-storage facility, airport hangars at Wiley Post Airport, several warehouses, a few small homes, and several businesses. The tornado damaged approximately 70 airplanes and 40 hangers were damaged or destroyed at Wiley Post Airport. Many of the airplanes damaged were inside the hangers.A man suffered fatal injuries (indirect) in Warr Acres. An eighty year old man from Woodward, Oklahoma was visiting relatives in Warr Acres.

The tornado first formed southeast of Steffenville where it damaged a barn and other outbuildings. Six homes suffered varying degrees of roof damage as the tornado crossed Highway N south of Ewing. The tornado crossed Highway 6 southeast of Ewing and damaged an electric substation. From Highway CC north to Highway P, about 20 homes and farm buildings suffered varying degrees of roof, siding and window damage. Numerous large trees were either uprooted or snapped off near the ground as well.  The tornado crossed Highway 61 just southeast of Canton where it blew two tractor trailers off the road. Two men suffered minor injuries. The tornado then entered Canton about 630 pm. Information from Emergency Management personnel and city officials in Canton revealed 75-100 structures damaged with at least 40 receiving major damage. At Culver-Stockton College on the southeast side of town, the field house was flattened and another two story building lost its roof. Several very large trees on the campus were uprooted or snapped off near the ground. Four mobile homes on the north side of town were destroyed with four others suffering major damage. There were only 4 minor injuries reported in Canton.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This thunderstorm developed in southwest Oklahoma along a retreating dryline. The storm moved northeast across Oklahoma eventually dissipating in northeastern Oklahoma. Most of the tornadoes occurred after dark. Three of the tornadoes affected western and northern portions of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area making two days in a row (see May 8, 2003 data) that the Oklahoma City metro area was affected by a tornadic thunderstorm. The strongest tornado, an F3, moved across portions of the northeastern metro area. Large hail and strong straight-line winds associated with the rear-flank downdraft also occurred with this tornadic supercell. Other severe thunderstorms produced damaging large hail and strong winds across portions of Oklahoma.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This long track tornado began 0.25 miles northeast of the intersection of North Kelly Avenue and East Wilshire Boulevard, just northeast of the KWTV-9 TV station and near the WB-34 TV station...neither tall tower was toppled. As the tornado moved northeast to Interstate 35, the width of the damage consistently was a third of a mile wide, and the maximum damage was F1 with widespread tree damage, snapped power poles, and roof damage to a number of homes south of Britton Road. The damage intensified to F2 on the west side of Interstate 35 where the roof was taken off of one wing of the Clara Waters Community Corrections Center. South of East Hefner Road and east of Interstate 35, an industrial building at a horse ranching operation sustained F3 damage. At that location, the steel frame, fastened to the concrete foundation with four one-inch diameter steel rods, was destroyed and steel reinforced concrete was pulled out of the ground. The tornado next produced F2 damage to the front portion of the Oakdale School at North Sooner Road and East Hefner Road. The Witcher Baptist Church, just south of the school, sustained F1 damage. East of Sooner Road and north of Hefner Road, the tornado weakened, producing F1 damage on the southeast side of the River Oaks Golf Club/Community. South of Northeast 122nd Street, between North Air Depot Boulevard and North Midwest Boulevard, the tornado strengthened again and the path widened to over three-quarters of a mile wide as the tornado turned more to the northeast. South of Northeast 122nd, between Midwest Boulevard and Douglas Boulevard, significant damage occurred to homes and trees. One home was completely destroyed (F3), two homes were heavily damaged (F2), and a vehicle was tossed 25 yards. The tornado turned to the southeast and damage weakened to F1 approximately 0.3 miles west of the intersection of North Post Road and Hefner Road. The tornado then turned back east-northeast causing a sheet metal hay barn to be completely blown down with hay intact. Several poles were downed towards the north, 0.25 miles west of the barn. Partial barn roof removal was found southwest of location in an open field. Another area of F1 damage began 0.3 miles north of the intersection of North 108th Street and Westminster Boulevard. A metal roof was peeled off and several tree limbs downed in this location. The tornado intensified to F2 just shortly after this, downing high tension poles 0.5 miles north of the intersection of Anderson Road and 108th Street. A farm just to the west of this location had a roof missing. The roof slid off the garage to the east. Large barn on west side lost west end of roof with debris inside. Northeast wall section of barn was essentially undamaged. A house also had shingle damage and broken windows. To the north of the farm, trees were damaged and poles were snapped.The tornado continued northeast causing the metal roof of a building, located 0.4 miles south of the intersection of Hiwassee Road and Memorial Road (North 136th Street), to peel off and be thrown 30 yards to the south. Tree damage was also found south of this location. A farm was damaged 0.8 miles south of the intersection. A barn was heavily damaged with debris thrown to the north. A pecan fork was also downed. There was also shingle damage just south of the barn. The tornado then caused damage to an outbuilding at the corner of Northeast 122nd Street and Henney Road. In an area just west of the intersection of Choctaw Road and Memorial Road, the northwest part of the roof of a house located on Spruce Valley Drive was removed, along with removing the roof of a mobile home located on Cedar Bend Road.As the tornado continued northeast, it uprooted trees and downed tree limbs. Shortly before the tornado dissipated, a mobile home rolled off of cinder blocks, but was otherwise undamaged. The tornado did some more minor tree damage before dissipating.The tornado first moved northeast causing a damage path which was located from 6.9 miles south of Edmond to 4.8 miles northwest of Jones. The tornado then turned southeast with a path from 4.8 miles northwest of Jones to 3.9 miles west-northwest of Jones. After the tornado turned back to the northeast, the path extended from 3.9 miles west-northwest of Jones to 2.8 miles south of Luther. The tornado traveled a total of 17.8 miles before dissipating.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado moved northeast and crossed the northern sections of the city uprooting trees, downing power lines and destroying a couple of grain bins.  A construction business in a garage was also destroyed. The tornado then continued northeast of town hitting a large hog farm.  At this farm a 70-year-old man was killed while in a storage shed when a tractor that was flipped by the winds crushed him.  Many livestock were also killed by debris or flung through the air by the deadly winds.  In one case cattle were carried over a mile then left dead in a pile.  The tornado then widened to around 3/4 of a mile, reaching its maximum intensity.  Numerous vehicles were tossed at this location and a complete farmstead was flattened.  Trees were also stripped and debarked.  The tornado remained around 3/4 of a mile wide for a few more miles before turning slightly to the southeast and diminishing, but not before hitting 2 more farmsteads and moving one house off of its foundation.  In total, 11 homes received substantial damage and between 100 and 200 utility poles were downed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.7M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado moved northeast and crossed the northern sections of the city uprooting trees, downing power lines and destroying a couple of grain bins.  A construction business in a garage was also destroyed. The tornado then continued northeast of town hitting a large hog farm.  At this farm a 70-year-old man was killed while in a storage shed when a tractor that was flipped by the winds crushed him.  Many livestock were also killed by debris or flung through the air by the deadly winds.  In one case cattle were carried over a mile then left dead in a pile.  The tornado then widened to around 3/4 of a mile, reaching its maximum intensity.  Numerous vehicles were tossed at this location and a complete farmstead was flattened.  Trees were also stripped and debarked.  The tornado remained around 3/4 of a mile wide for a few more miles before turning slightly to the southeast and diminishing, but not before hitting 2 more farmsteads and moving one house off of its foundation.  In total, 11 homes received substantial damage and between 100 and 200 utility poles were downed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.7M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At the surface, a deep low pressure area moved across the eastern Great Lakes, driving a warm front across eastern New York and adjacent New England. The air became very unstable in the warm air mass behind the front. The combination of the unstable air and strong wind shear aloft, produced the most significant severe outbreak of the season across the region, and the largest tornado outbreak since May 31, 1998.   	The first line of thunderstorms worked across the region during the afternoon hours. These produced spotty wind damage, mainly downed trees and wires across portions of Albany, Greene, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga and Schoharie Counties. Torrential rains falling in a very short interval of time caused flash flooding in the city of Schenectady. North Jay Street suddenly flooded and a woman had to be rescued from her car as it became submerged in about three feet of moving water. 	An even stronger line of storms moved east from central New York, into eastern New York during the evening hours. This squall line produced wind damage of its own, with spotty downed trees and wires across portions of Albany and Washington counties. Wind damage was more concentrated in Ulster and Dutchess counties. In Saugherties, Ulster County, downed trees flattened three cars. In Dutchess County, a large swath of trees were downed in the town of East Fishkill and in the town of Tivoli, a state of emergency was declared.    	One cell broke loose from the line, and became a supercell as it reached the Mid Hudson Valley. This storm ultimately spawned a long lived significant tornado. The twister initially touched down in southeastern Greene County, and produced a  discontinous path of 17 miles in Greene County, 12.2 miles in northwestern Columbia County and 4.8 miles in southern Rensselaer County.  The tornada left a swath of destruction including hundreds, if not thousands of trees uprooted and snapped away, along with lots of power and telephone wires. Many roads in each of these counties were impassable due to debris. 	The first confirmed touchdown was in the town of Palenville, Greene County. The tornado was ranked as F1 with a 50 yard wide path and on the ground for a half mile. An unoccupied home had its siding ripped off. Several other homes were severely damaged including a trailor. The tornado next touched downed in the hamlet of Kiskatom, in the town of Catskill, where it increased to F2 intensity and cut a path 150 yards wide and over a mile long. Several homes were destroyed along with seven injuries right off Route 32 in the Brookside Camp Grounds.  Four people were trapped inside one of the trailer homes. Another lady was trapped inside a mobile home as it was lifted into the air then smashed into the ground. The woman was badly bruised but survived the ordeal. The next touchdown was in Athens with a rating of F0, and the last touchdown in Greene County was in Coaxsackie where a manufactured home was hoisted off its foundation, and had insulation pasted to the siding on the downwind side, which is typical of F1 damage.  	The tornado ripped across Columbia County with two touchdowns confirmed in the towns of Kinderhook, the Newtown Hook section in the town of Stuyvesant and the town of Niverville. The touchdown at Kinderhook Lake the strongest, with a ranking of F2. A barn was completely destroyed and the unfortunate farmer stated that some of his haywagons ended up in Kinderhook Lake. A garage was completely leveled and a car was tossed onto the tops of a blown-down tree. Another building had its metal roof partially peeled back. In Niverville, 11 people were given shelter as they were afraid to stay in their damaged homes. Straight-line thunderstorms produced additional tree and wire damage in the towns of Chatham, Hudson and Valatia. A state of emergency was declared throughout Columbia County. There was one injury reported by the newspaper in that county. The only hail reported with these storm took place in Stockpart, where golf ball size stones where reported. A state of emergency was declared in all of Columbia County right after the tornado past on by. 	The supercell and resultant tornado next touched down in the town of Nassua in Rensselaer County, near Route 20 with a rating of F1. The average width of the twister was between 75 and 100 yards and a discontinous path length of more than four miles. More homes and a garage were severly damaged but no injuries were reported. The roof on the Agway was blown off and a gazebo landed across the state highway in a  pile of splintered wood. The NWS Survey team noted that the twister had multiple vortices in this area.  Additional straight line damage was also noted in the same town. The last touchdowns were in the town of Schaghticoke with an F1 rating.  	During the height of the storms, as many as 63,000 customers were reported to have lost power in eastern New York, nearly 7,000 of those in Greene County alone. Power restoration was not completed until the following Friday.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At the surface, a deep low pressure area moved across the eastern Great Lakes, driving a warm front across eastern New York and adjacent New England. The air became very unstable in the warm air mass behind the front. The combination of the unstable air and strong wind shear aloft, produced the most significant severe outbreak of the season across the region, and the largest tornado outbreak since May 31, 1998.   	The first line of thunderstorms worked across the region during the afternoon hours. These produced spotty wind damage, mainly downed trees and wires across portions of Albany, Greene, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga and Schoharie Counties. Torrential rains falling in a very short interval of time caused flash flooding in the city of Schenectady. North Jay Street suddenly flooded and a woman had to be rescued from her car as it became submerged in about three feet of moving water. 	An even stronger line of storms moved east from central New York, into eastern New York during the evening hours. This squall line produced wind damage of its own, with spotty downed trees and wires across portions of Albany and Washington counties. Wind damage was more concentrated in Ulster and Dutchess counties. In Saugherties, Ulster County, downed trees flattened three cars. In Dutchess County, a large swath of trees were downed in the town of East Fishkill and in the town of Tivoli, a state of emergency was declared.    	One cell broke loose from the line, and became a supercell as it reached the Mid Hudson Valley. This storm ultimately spawned a long lived significant tornado. The twister initially touched down in southeastern Greene County, and produced a  discontinous path of 17 miles in Greene County, 12.2 miles in northwestern Columbia County and 4.8 miles in southern Rensselaer County.  The tornada left a swath of destruction including hundreds, if not thousands of trees uprooted and snapped away, along with lots of power and telephone wires. Many roads in each of these counties were impassable due to debris. 	The first confirmed touchdown was in the town of Palenville, Greene County. The tornado was ranked as F1 with a 50 yard wide path and on the ground for a half mile. An unoccupied home had its siding ripped off. Several other homes were severely damaged including a trailor. The tornado next touched downed in the hamlet of Kiskatom, in the town of Catskill, where it increased to F2 intensity and cut a path 150 yards wide and over a mile long. Several homes were destroyed along with seven injuries right off Route 32 in the Brookside Camp Grounds.  Four people were trapped inside one of the trailer homes. Another lady was trapped inside a mobile home as it was lifted into the air then smashed into the ground. The woman was badly bruised but survived the ordeal. The next touchdown was in Athens with a rating of F0, and the last touchdown in Greene County was in Coaxsackie where a manufactured home was hoisted off its foundation, and had insulation pasted to the siding on the downwind side, which is typical of F1 damage.  	The tornado ripped across Columbia County with two touchdowns confirmed in the towns of Kinderhook, the Newtown Hook section in the town of Stuyvesant and the town of Niverville. The touchdown at Kinderhook Lake the strongest, with a ranking of F2. A barn was completely destroyed and the unfortunate farmer stated that some of his haywagons ended up in Kinderhook Lake. A garage was completely leveled and a car was tossed onto the tops of a blown-down tree. Another building had its metal roof partially peeled back. In Niverville, 11 people were given shelter as they were afraid to stay in their damaged homes. Straight-line thunderstorms produced additional tree and wire damage in the towns of Chatham, Hudson and Valatia. A state of emergency was declared throughout Columbia County. There was one injury reported by the newspaper in that county. The only hail reported with these storm took place in Stockpart, where golf ball size stones where reported. A state of emergency was declared in all of Columbia County right after the tornado past on by. 	The supercell and resultant tornado next touched down in the town of Nassua in Rensselaer County, near Route 20 with a rating of F1. The average width of the twister was between 75 and 100 yards and a discontinous path length of more than four miles. More homes and a garage were severly damaged but no injuries were reported. The roof on the Agway was blown off and a gazebo landed across the state highway in a  pile of splintered wood. The NWS Survey team noted that the twister had multiple vortices in this area.  Additional straight line damage was also noted in the same town. The last touchdowns were in the town of Schaghticoke with an F1 rating.  	During the height of the storms, as many as 63,000 customers were reported to have lost power in eastern New York, nearly 7,000 of those in Greene County alone. Power restoration was not completed until the following Friday.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In addition to these tornadoes, a major flood developed over Harris and surrounding counties during the middle of this tornadic outbreak. Over 300 homes, along with hundreds of vehicles, were flooded.These tornadic storms developed over parts of Wharton and Matagorda counties shortly after sunrise with the first confirmed tornado occurring just east of El Campo around 9:00 am. Strong 500mb upper level troughing over the western U.S. moved from west to east across the Southern Plains. The polar jet stream associated with this 500 millibar trough surged into west Texas and then curved sharply northeastward into the Central Plains. The sub-tropical jet stream was oriented west to east across deep southern Texas. This jet stream pattern was the impetus to strong lower level convergence due to the enhanced upper level divergence. Low level moisture had substantially increased and was about 200 percent of normal by 6 AM. Vertical wind profiles also showed a great deal of low level wind shear with the greatest shear occurring in the lowest 2000 feet. In addition, these veering wind speeds rapidly increased with height. A focus for the thunderstorm development was provided by a weak low level boundary which was aligned southwest to northeast, or generally along the U.S. Highway 59 corridor. This feature was nearly-stationary and thunderstorms repeatedly developed and moved along this boundary. The axis of heaviest rain was coincident with this boundary.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Extensive flooding in and around the Sharpstown area.

The extremely heavy rain resulted in widespread flooding across Mitchell county.  Before the flooding began, the complex of thunderstorms had a history of producing winds in excess of 60 mph and hail to the size of golf balls.  The largest hail was reported near Damar and Stockton in Rooks county, and around Webber in Jewell county.  Winds of 60 to 80 mph were also reported and caused damage from Smith Center to Glen Elder.  In Smith Center, a roof was torn from a church by the high wind while windows were blown out of a downtown business.  Large tree limbs were reported down in the Glen Elder area.  Electricity was lost to several locations throughout the night.By late evening, radar estimates and reports from around Mitchell county began to paint a picture of torrential rainfall and widespread flooding across the county.  About 8 inches of rain was reported in Beloit, with 8 to 12 inches measured south and east of town.  Water was over Highway 14 south of Beloit.  The road was blocked off for a time.  There were reports of numerous bridges and roads under water or washed out from west of Beloit to the east end of the county along and near the Solomon River.  At the Indian Creek Bridge about 2 miles west of Beloit, a farmer narrowly escaped death as his tractor collapsed the bridge and he was washed into the creek and eventually into the Solomon River.  After being washed downstream by the raging current, the farmer grabbed a hold of some tree branches along the river and pulled himself to safety from the water.  He suffered minor injuries from the ordeal.The Solomon River was out of its banks from west of Beloit downstream to Simpson.  The river crested around 25 feet at Beloit or about 5 feet above flood stage.  The flow recorded by the USGS at Simpson on the eastern Mitchell county line was greater than the flow recorded in 1993.  Throughout Mitchell county, economic losses due to soil erosion, crop flooding and structural damage to farmstead buildings totaled from 1 to 3 million dollars.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A weak frontal system advanced across the plains into the state.  Temperatures warmed in to the 70s with dew points approaching 60 near an approaching warm frontal boundary from the south.  Lifted indices were in the -3 to -4 C. range.  A line of thunderstorms developed over Nebraska and advanced into western Iowa by evening.  One storm developed ahead of the line in Carroll County.  This storm became severe and dropped nickle to golf ball size hail in Carroll County.  Although radar gave strong suggestions of a tornado development, only a rotating wall cloud was observed.  As the main line of storms moved in from the west, there were numerous reports of 40 to 50 MPH winds along the line.

The storm moved east across Ballard County, producing quarter-size hail. One-inch diameter hail was reported on U.S. Highway 60 at mile marker 7, near Barlow. Hailstones grew larger as the storm crossed McCracken County, pounding the southwest side of Paducah and Lone Oak with hail from golf ball to tennis ball size. Thousands of vehicles were dented, and hail broke some windshields, including the windshield of a deputy sheriff's vehicle. The roofs of hundreds of buildings sustained at least minor damage. The only known injury occurred in Paducah, when a woman leaving church received cuts and abrasions from hailstones. She was treated at a local hospital. As the storm continued east across northern Marshall County, hail up to baseball size broke the windshields of many vehicles and damaged the siding and roofing of homes. A downburst with estimated 80 MPH winds began along Highway 641 and continued east for 3 miles toward Kentucky Lake. Numerous trees were blown down, some of which landed on houses. In Lyon County, the storm produced golf-ball hail east of Barkley Dam before finally weakening. Although total damage estimates as reported by insurance companies are in the tens of millions of dollars, the exact amount will never be known.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A severe thunderstorm emerged into Cameron County from northern Mexico and dropped large amounts of wind-driven hail upon the city.  The hail destroyed roofs of homes and businesses, broke countless windows of automobiles and homes, and damaged vegetation.  Approximately 10,000 insurance claims have been filed in association with this storm.  Most of the large hail reports occurred between 925 and 950 CDT.The Brownsville Police Department reported that 12 cruisers had windshields shattered by hail, and Hanna High School in central Brownsville reported 285 automobiles with wndows broken by hail.  Much of the northern and central portions of the city suffered damage from this intense and historic storm.  The storm was heavily documented and covered in the media with widespread accounts of its damage.

The first storm pounded Kankakee county with hail up to golfball size.  Other storms quickly developed in northern Cook, and in McHenry and Lake counties.  Golfball size hail hit the areas of Buffalo Grove, Wheeling, and Deerfield along Lake-Cook Road.  The hail damaged police cars and cracked the windshield of a vehicle in Wheeling.  A car was dented in Deerfield.  This storm also blew down tree limbs in Deerfield.  Another storm in Ottawa in LaSalle county produced hail the size of golfballs, injuring a person at Chambers and Glover Streets.  60 mph winds in and near Ottawa damaged corn crops and blew tree limbs down on the road.  A bolt of lightning struck a tree in Ottawa causing the tree to fall onto a fence and pool which were damaged.  A storm dropped hail in southern Grundy and southwest Will counties.  Hail damaged crops from north and east of Kinsman to just west of Verona, just east of Mazon, north and east of Gardner, and north of Morris in Grundy county.  Trees, large limbs and power lines were blown down in Gardner.  Hail also fell from near Wilmington in Will county into Kankakee county near Essex.  Another storm in northern Will county dropped hail up to 1.25 inches in diameter from the far west side of Joliet and Plainfiled near Drauden and Caton Farm, across I-55 and Route 30, to I-55 and Weber Road in Romeoville and Bolingbrook.  This storm also caused tree damage in Lemont in Cook county.  Later in the afternoon a storm dropped hail 1 to 2 inches in diameter across DuPage county. Some locations included Army Trail and Gary in Bloomingdale, 2 miles north of Route 64 and 59 in West Chicago, Route 83 and Grand in Addison, Glendale Heights, Wheaton and Lombard.  The biggest hail report was 2 inches at Carol Stream.  Other storms produced hail near Ashkum in Iroquois county and into northwest Indiana.  Storms produced more hail in southern Cook and northern Will counties in the early evening before ending.  Tree branches were also blown down around Orland Park and Oak Forest.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
