Two vehicles were damaged when trees fell on them. One fatality occurred when a tree fell on a pedestrian in a parked vehicle. The tree damage was extensive with many old growth white pines, oaks and willows being uprooted and or snapped. Power outages were extensive in the area with many snapped poles and downed lines.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A southerly low level jet quickly spread low level moisture north ahead of the front, while also enhancing convergence along the front to allow for a complex of showers and thunderstorms to develop over portions of Oklahoma and North Texas. These storms produced a strong cold pool resulting in very strong to occasionally severe winds across East Texas, which downed sporadic trees before re-intensifying as they entered Northwest Louisiana during the pre-dawn hours.

A series of surges along this line caused localized severe wind gusts that produced numerous downed trees and power lines across southern Minnesota. One of the storms produced an EF0 tornado south of Henderson in far southeast Sibley County. ||As this line moved across the southern Metro of the Twin Cities, three tornadoes briefly spun-up leading to multiple power outages, plus major damage to Savage public works building and a large transformer for the city of Savage. In addition, the power outages caused local schools to close temporarily Friday morning. Another area of tornado damage occurred in Apple Valley and Burnsville. Most of this damage was due to trees falling on houses and vehicles.||A 64 mph wind gust was measured by the ASOS at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. At MSP Airport, with the strong winds and possibly brakes not being applied and/or improper chocking, two Sun Country aircraft slid into each other and into jetways H3 and H4, causing fairly significant damage.||Outside the tornadic activity, several sources of private and public weather sensors measured wind speeds of 40 to 55 mph across a wide swath of southern Minnesota. These winds coupled with heavy rainfall, caused numerous downed small trees and large branches across a 25 to 50 mile wide area from Redwood Falls, to St James, then northeast to New Ulm, Shakopee, St. Paul, and into parts of west central Wisconsin.||In addition, near Mankato, MN around 0730 UTC, a 4-year old girl was killed when a tree branch fell on the tent where she and her family were camping. There were  approximately 80,000 people without power during the peak of the severity that moved through the metro area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tree branch fell onto a tent at the Land of Memories Park. A family was in the tent and a 4 year old girl was killed from injuries of the fallen tree branch.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Temperatures broke several long-standing records. Memphis hit 80��F which broke a 103-year-old high-temperature record. ||A strong upper-level trough was approaching from the west, providing strong lift within the unseasonably warm and unstable air mass.  MLCAPE reached the 1500-2000 J/kg range by 6 PM. The wind field was impressive with plenty of vertical wind shear needed for organized thunderstorms. Effective 0-1 km storm-relative helicity values ranged from 300-400 m2/s2 with effective bulk shear values of 70 knots - more than sufficient to support discrete supercells in the warm sector ahead of the cold front.||The first supercell developed in central Arkansas and tracked into northeast Arkansas producing a few weak tornadoes initially before intensifying across eastern Craighead and Mississippi Counties and killing two people. The tornado eventually strengthened into an EF-4 while moving through the Missouri Bootheel, resulting in 2 direct and one indirect fatality in Pemiscot County. The tornado then tracked across the Mississippi River into northwest Tennessee, producing an additional 4 fatalities near Reelfoot Lake. This tornado lifted for a brief time in Obion County, reorganized, and then moved into Kentucky. All told, the mesocyclone tracked for over 300 miles and was producing tornadoes for over 250 miles. This storm was responsible for at least 9 fatalities and many injuries in the NWS Memphis CWA along with millions of dollars of damage. ||As the initial supercell was crossing the state line into Kentucky, a string of supercells was moving into eastern Arkansas. A few brief tornadoes produced minor damage near Cash in western Craighead County and in the Fisher area of western Poinsett County. As the dominant supercell moved into eastern Poinsett County, the mesocyclone quickly intensified and the storm produced an EF-2 tornado in Trumann with several injuries and widespread damage. ||A new supercell developed in Mississippi County causing straight-line wind damage initially. This supercell intensified as it crossed the Mississippi River and produced another long-track tornado starting in Dyer County,  Tennessee. This tornado tracked east-northeast across northwest Tennessee into Henry County, and eventually into Kentucky. This tornado was rated EF-3 and resulted in several injuries with Kenton and Dresden, Tennessee being the hardest hit. ||The convection eventually evolved into a QLCS as it moved east. A mesovortex developed south of I-40 near Jackson that resulted in 3 tornadoes across eastern Madison, Henderson, and Decatur Counties including an EF-2. Non-tornadic storms moved across the Memphis metropolitan area, producing straight-line wind damage as a mesovortex moved through the city. A fatality was reported in Shelby County after a large tree fell on a home in South Memphis. Later that night, an EF-1 tornado occurred in Prentiss County before the severe weather threat began to wind down around 6 AM on December 11, 2021. ||In total, there were 18 tornadoes across the NWS Memphis CWA.  Along with tornadoes, several incidents of wind damage and minor flash flooding also occurred.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous trees were knocked down from Orange Mound into East Buntyn.

A warm front moved northward into Middle Tennessee early on March 27 before stalling near the I-40 corridor. Between 300-400 AM CDT, numerous showers and thunderstorms developed along the warm front, many of which became severe and produced large hail up to half dollar size along with frequent lightning and heavy rainfall. Showers and storms continued off and on the rest of the day across Middle Tennessee, particularly near the stalled warm front. In fact, another round of severe thunderstorms including supercells developed during the afternoon and evening hours near and south of the warm front. These storms dropped large hail up to tennis ball size and caused a few reports of wind damage, but the main impact was additional heavy rainfall which began causing flash flooding south of Nashville. Flooding only worsened as showers and storms redeveloped over the same areas through the evening, with numerous Flash Flood Warnings issued and several reports of flooded roads and water rescues.||After midnight, even more heavy rainfall falling along the already waterlogged I-40 corridor prompted a rare Flash Flood Emergency for the southern and eastern Nashville metro area, including southeastern Davidson County, western Wilson County, and northern Williamson County. These areas received between 7 to 9 of rain, causing rapid rises on several Nashville metro creeks and streams, including Sevenmile Creek (which reached its highest level on record), Browns Creek, and Mill Creek, among others. Many of these creeks reached within their 2nd or 3rd highest water levels on record. The rapid water rises flooded hundreds of homes and businesses, with reports of some people trapped in the attics or on the roofs of their houses. Dozens of roadways were flooded and impassable, including both I-24 and I-40, with many cars submerged in the flood waters and people forced to cling onto trees to avoid getting swept away. Although the flood waters receded quickly on Sunday, March 28, many area rivers reached flood stage in the week after the event, including the Cumberland River, Harpeth River, and Duck River.||A total of 7 deaths were reported from the flooding across Middle Tennessee, with 5 in Davidson County, 1 in Cheatham County, and 1 in Maury County. Emergency management reports indicate over 500 homes and businesses were flooded, and a Presidential Disaster Proclamation was declared for many counties in May 2021. This flash flood event was the worst seen in Middle Tennessee since the May 1-2, 2010 flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A man drowned in his vehicle after driving around high water barricades into flood waters on Tennessee Waltz Parkway near Highway 12 in Ashland City.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

There may have been other tornadoes associated with circulations that were noted on radar, but emergency management confirmed damage consistent with tornadoes near Trenton and Laredo Missouri. Most of the damage was minor, but some grain bins being blown off their foundation was the highlight of the damage in the area. Rainfall was the other big story with this event as some areas received 6 to 10 inches of rain. Despite the excessive rain, the flash flooding was rather minor, however there were still numerous roads closed, and areas near Excelsior Springs were especially hard hit as the Fishing River rose out of its banks.

This second atmospheric river episode of the month was a set of three atmospheric rivers back-to-back-to-back. Water vapor transport into Western Washington averaged 160 - 200% of normal during the period of 11 November - 16 November. Heavy rainfall spread across the region on the night of the 11th through November 12, with the heaviest rain starting across Southwest Washington and slowly shifting to the north through the day. Rainfall totals ranged from 5 to 10 inches in spots leading to areal and river flooding, including major flooding. |Heavy, persistent rainfall associated with the Atmospheric River shifted northward across Western Washington on November 13 before stalling over northwest Washington November 14 through 16. Another 5 to 10 inches of rainfall fell across the northern half of western Washington. The snow level rose to 8000 to 10,000 feet, resulting in some snow melt contributing to runoff.  Widespread minor or greater flooding occurred. Major flooding occurred on the Bogachiel, the three forecast points on the Nooksack, Skagit, and Cowlitz Rivers. Moderate flooding occurred on the Elwha, Skokomish, Skykomish, Snohomish, Snoqualmie, Puyallup, Nisqually, Newaukum Rivers and South Prairie Creek. Preliminary record flows occurred on Nooksack, Bogachiel, Calawah Rivers and Olsen Creek. Hundreds of water rescues and two fatalities took place during this time period. The heavy rainfall also triggered numerous landslides due to loading on the already-saturated soils.|Much of the reported damage amounts were for both episodes in November and some of the amounts for this episode were an estimated proportion for the month.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rain and some snow melt caused flooding that exceeded major severity on the South Fork Nooksack River and mainstem Nooksack River at North Cedarville and Ferndale. There was urban and small stream flooding as well, hitting Bellingham especially hard. The heavy rain also triggered a dozen landslides throughout the area. Significant flooding on the Nooksack River also overflowed at the City of Everson to the degree that flood waters flowed north along an old Nooksack floodway and Johnson Creek where it flooded the cities of Everson and Nooksack, WA, then combined with flooding from the Sumas River and flooded the City of Sumas, WA where over 85% of homes sustained water damage. Damages are reported and estimated; not all damages have been identified. Crop damages are unknown.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 34.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One homeowner with a|personal home anemometer measured an unofficial 68mph wind gust.||The last two properties, those closest to 115, had the most|substantial damage.

They also reported seeing the tornado|moving into the next properties across WV-115.||As the storm crossed WV-115, several large branches were snapped|off trees in front of Two Crows Antique Mall. While many branches|were thrown east, a large one was also thrown to the northwest.||The tornado then struck a warehouse at Universal Forest Products|and reached peak intensity. On this property it pushed over a|large warehouse building that was partially opened along its|sides. The main beams of the building were large timbers secured|to the ground with bolts. The roof was tin and sections of that|roof were carried a half a mile into an adjacent community. People|were in the building at the time, but fortunately the only injury|was a minor leg abrasion to one person. Another smaller warehouse|building was also destroyed. It also caused roof and siding|damage to at least two other buildings on this property.||The tornado weakened substantially as it traveled east from the|warehouses. Debris, but not significant tree damage was noted|along Foal Street. Some intermittent damage continued into the|new Fairfax Crossing community where some minor siding and shingle|damage was noted as well as a few small ornamental trees that|were downed. Some final pieces of tin roof were noted here as|well.||The tornado was witnessed to the south by someone in the nearby|Potomac Marketplace shopping center as it crossed WV Route 9. From|there it passed through mobile home communities along Grayrock|Road and Cambridge Drive causing a few large branches to be|snapped as well as some roofing damage to at least one mobile|home. The tornado lifted before reaching Flowing Acres Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

They also reported seeing the tornado|moving into the next properties across WV-115.||As the storm crossed WV-115, several large branches were snapped|off trees in front of Two Crows Antique Mall. While many branches|were thrown east, a large one was also thrown to the northwest.||The tornado then struck a warehouse at Universal Forest Products|and reached peak intensity. On this property it pushed over a|large warehouse building that was partially opened along its|sides. The main beams of the building were large timbers secured|to the ground with bolts. The roof was tin and sections of that|roof were carried a half a mile into an adjacent community. People|were in the building at the time, but fortunately the only injury|was a minor leg abrasion to one person. Another smaller warehouse|building was also destroyed. It also caused roof and siding|damage to at least two other buildings on this property.||The tornado weakened substantially as it traveled east from the|warehouses. Debris, but not significant tree damage was noted|along Foal Street. Some intermittent damage continued into the|new Fairfax Crossing community where some minor siding and shingle|damage was noted as well as a few small ornamental trees that|were downed. Some final pieces of tin roof were noted here as|well.||The tornado was witnessed to the south by someone in the nearby|Potomac Marketplace shopping center as it crossed WV Route 9. From|there it passed through mobile home communities along Grayrock|Road and Cambridge Drive causing a few large branches to be|snapped as well as some roofing damage to at least one mobile|home. The tornado lifted before reaching Flowing Acres Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A squall line preceded the front with scattered reports of severe weather, including a few tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado first began east of Wicksburg and east of the Houston/Geneva county line where scattered tree limbs where reported by the emergency manager. The tornado then strengthened and hit several structures on a farm where damage was confined to ripped roof paneling and other similar damage. The tornado then traveled northeast towards US-84. It was in these locations that the tornado was likely at its peak strength as it moved across Marshall Rd and into the Highlands Subdivision along Highway 84. Along Marshall Rd, a double wide sustained significant roof covering loss, a large carport over a RV was completely destroyed, and a out building nearby was missing nearly its entire roof with some walls partially collapsed. The tornado also briefly picked up a boat, with trailer, and rolled/rotated it 180 degrees on the trailer before being laid to rest nearly 75-100 yards from its original location. EF-1 damage was again observed in the Highlands Subdivision south of US Highway 84. Two homes sustained roof damage with one home sustaining partial roof loss on the second story. Many pine trees near this house were also snapped or uprooted. While these were the only homes with notable damage in the community, there was a path of widespread tree damage through the rest of the neighborhood. The tornado then crossed US-84 where damage became more isolated with a few downed trees and broken branches. The tornado is then estimated to have lifted just northeast of North Brannon Stand Rd. Max winds were estimated around 100 mph.  The NWS thanks Houston County EM Chris Judah for his assistance during this survey.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A squall line preceded the front with scattered reports of severe weather, including a few tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado first began east of Wicksburg and east of the Houston/Geneva county line where scattered tree limbs where reported by the emergency manager. The tornado then strengthened and hit several structures on a farm where damage was confined to ripped roof paneling and other similar damage. The tornado then traveled northeast towards US-84. It was in these locations that the tornado was likely at its peak strength as it moved across Marshall Rd and into the Highlands Subdivision along Highway 84. Along Marshall Rd, a double wide sustained significant roof covering loss, a large carport over a RV was completely destroyed, and a out building nearby was missing nearly its entire roof with some walls partially collapsed. The tornado also briefly picked up a boat, with trailer, and rolled/rotated it 180 degrees on the trailer before being laid to rest nearly 75-100 yards from its original location. EF-1 damage was again observed in the Highlands Subdivision south of US Highway 84. Two homes sustained roof damage with one home sustaining partial roof loss on the second story. Many pine trees near this house were also snapped or uprooted. While these were the only homes with notable damage in the community, there was a path of widespread tree damage through the rest of the neighborhood. The tornado then crossed US-84 where damage became more isolated with a few downed trees and broken branches. The tornado is then estimated to have lifted just northeast of North Brannon Stand Rd. Max winds were estimated around 100 mph.  The NWS thanks Houston County EM Chris Judah for his assistance during this survey.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A large portion of a roof was blown off a metal building on the west side of 904, several RVs were rolled over, and several large pine trees were snapped. The tornado crossed Hwy 904, snapped numerous trees and caused moderate damage to a large metal building and church.||The tornado entered the Ocean Ridge Plantation neighborhood with wind speeds up to 125 mph. Hundreds of trees were snapped, and many homes sustained minor to moderate damage. It crossed Rosebury Court SW, then strengthened to its maximum intensity of 160 mph (EF-3), as it approached Cambria Court SW. Two homes were completely destroyed in this area, and several more sustained moderate to major damage. The tornado reached its maximum path width of 275 yards as it moved across Windsor Circle, although maximum winds decreased to 115 mph (EF2). Many homes sustained moderate to major damage, hundreds of large trees were snapped, and one automobile was observed rolled on its side.||It crossed Hwy 17 as an EF-1, then re-intensified to an EF-2, causing major damage to several homes and snapping hundreds of trees along Green Bay Road NW and Old Shallote Road NW. The tornado continued to produce a near continuous path of tree damage through forest and swamp land, across Hwy 130 and Highway 211, confirmed by helicopter overflight. The tornado lifted approximately three miles east of highway 211 after passing west of the Bear Pen Airstrip.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An associated, strengthening surface low also tracked out of the Great Lakes and into upstate New York. A warm front associated with this low moved through most of New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania during the late morning and early afternoon hours. This front, combined with the remains of widespread convection to the west from the previous overnight and morning hours, brought significant cloud cover to the eastern mid-Atlantic for much of the day on the 29th. This was mainly in the form of mid and high level cloud cover, however, and temperatures still warmed to near seasonal levels behind the warm front, allowing moderate to strong instability to build. Meanwhile, the robust surface and upper level disturbances approaching the region brought both strong forcing and unseasonably strong wind shear. By mid-afternoon, an unusually favorable convective environment existed over eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey.||The result of this environment was a rare tornado outbreak across the area. Initially, during the mid-afternoon hours, mixed convective modes over east-central Pennsylvania produced a couple instances of damaging wind and brief tornadoes as storms attempted to overcome cloud cover and some light stratiform rain in the area. With time, as storms moved into better instability and a less contaminated environment over far eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey, they took on more supercellular structures. Multiple cyclic supercells would go on to produce several tornadoes, three of them strong (EF2+) over eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Convection persisted past the sunset hour with little to no loss in intensity due to the strong forcing. The only thing that put an end to the outbreak was the coastline, as storms moved offshore towards 9 to 10PM local time. Even offshore, one supercell continued to exhibit strong rotation and likely produced a strong waterspout for tens of miles over the Atlantic.||Fortunately, and miraculously, no serious injuries or loss of life occurred as a result of this outbreak. With the passage of a cold front late on the evening of the 29th, cooler, drier, and much less active weather would grace the region for several days as clean-up efforts began.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The same supercell which produced a tornado in the New Jersey |Pine Barrens cycled and produced another tornado in far eastern |Ocean County.

The tornado then moved over |Barnegat Bay as a waterspout. It came ashore in the area of High |Bar Harbor in Long Beach Twp.||The most severe damage was noted to a house on the corner of |Antioch Rd and Arnold Blvd. This house was facing west-southwest, |and had its entire roof structure lifted off and tossed one to two|houses to the east. The house walls remained standing but most of|the doors and windows on the east and west sides of the house |were completely blown out, with significant damage to the inside |of the house. A two- by-four from an adjacent house impaled the |wall on the west side of the house. Eight people were in the house|at the time the tornado hit, but they were able to take shelter |in an interior closet, with only minor injuries sustained. In |addition, on the north side of the house, a car in the driveway |was pushed sideways several feet and their boat flipped into their|neighbor's boat. The boat's trailer was tossed about 50 feet into|a house just to the east. The degree and orientation of damage |was consistent with tornadic winds of 115 to 120 mph, which is EF2|intensity.||Continuing east-northeast, about a dozen homes on the south side |of Arnold Blvd sustained significant uplift of roof material, |siding damage or removal, collapse of porch, patio, and sunroom |structures, and blown out windows.

Large hail, damaging winds and five tornadoes occurred across central and eastern Missouri as well as south central Illinois.  Unfortunately two of the tornadoes were very strong (rated EF-3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale) and responsible for 7 fatalities (one near Defiance, Missouri and six at an Amazon Facility near Edwardsville, Illinois). The Defiance, MO tornado tracked within one mile of the NWS St. Louis office in the Missouri Research Park near Weldon Spring, MO leading to the staff sheltering while NWS Kansas City provided service backup.  This is only the third time in the office's existence that the staff had to shelter. The damage from the Defiance, MO EF3 tornado was estimated at $684,186 and is unknown for the remaining tracks at this time but early estimates are well into the millions due to the damage sustained at the Amazon facility near Edwardsville, IL.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado began on the south side of I-270 around three-quarters of a mile west of the I-270/I-255 interchange at 8:27 PM CST. Damage in this area consisted of several downed highway signs and a bent light pole. The tornado moved northeast and intensified rapidly after crossing I-255, striking an Amazon warehouse. The west-facing walls of the warehouse collapsed inward, which was followed by multiple structural failures as the tornado moved through the complex, including the collapse of additional walls and the loss of a large segment of the roof. This was the worst damage along the entire tornado track rated EF-3. Cars in the rear of the building were strewn eastward and power lines and several large high tension towers were also destroyed. There was one person injured and 6 fatalities at the Amazon facility. The tornado weakened as it moved northeast across Sand Road, where it destroyed an unanchored mobile home and an outbuilding, snapped trees, and downed power poles. Damage in this area was rated EF-1. Further northeast, the tornado crossed South University Drive where it snapped a power pole and downed additional trees. It then crossed into the Sunset Hills Country Club subdivision. Throughout a portion of the subdivision, there were downed trees, snapped branches, and superficial home damage consisting of missing shingles or small portions of roof covering. The tornado weakened further as it moved northeast, and lifted just west of Butler Boulevard at 8:35 PM CST. Noteworthy is debris from the Amazon warehouse was found along the entire track of this storm, tens of miles to the northeast of the warehouse. Overall, the tornado was rated EF3 with a path length of 4.22 miles and max path width of 300 yards. Six deaths and one injured were reported.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Large hail, damaging winds and five tornadoes occurred across central and eastern Missouri as well as south central Illinois.  Unfortunately two of the tornadoes were very strong (rated EF-3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale) and responsible for 7 fatalities (one near Defiance, Missouri and six at an Amazon Facility near Edwardsville, Illinois). The Defiance, MO tornado tracked within one mile of the NWS St. Louis office in the Missouri Research Park near Weldon Spring, MO leading to the staff sheltering while NWS Kansas City provided service backup.  This is only the third time in the office's existence that the staff had to shelter. The damage from the Defiance, MO EF3 tornado was estimated at $684,186 and is unknown for the remaining tracks at this time but early estimates are well into the millions due to the damage sustained at the Amazon facility near Edwardsville, IL.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado began on the south side of I-270 around three-quarters of a mile west of the I-270/I-255 interchange at 8:27 PM CST. Damage in this area consisted of several downed highway signs and a bent light pole. The tornado moved northeast and intensified rapidly after crossing I-255, striking an Amazon warehouse. The west-facing walls of the warehouse collapsed inward, which was followed by multiple structural failures as the tornado moved through the complex, including the collapse of additional walls and the loss of a large segment of the roof. This was the worst damage along the entire tornado track rated EF-3. Cars in the rear of the building were strewn eastward and power lines and several large high tension towers were also destroyed. There was one person injured and 6 fatalities at the Amazon facility. The tornado weakened as it moved northeast across Sand Road, where it destroyed an unanchored mobile home and an outbuilding, snapped trees, and downed power poles. Damage in this area was rated EF-1. Further northeast, the tornado crossed South University Drive where it snapped a power pole and downed additional trees. It then crossed into the Sunset Hills Country Club subdivision. Throughout a portion of the subdivision, there were downed trees, snapped branches, and superficial home damage consisting of missing shingles or small portions of roof covering. The tornado weakened further as it moved northeast, and lifted just west of Butler Boulevard at 8:35 PM CST. Noteworthy is debris from the Amazon warehouse was found along the entire track of this storm, tens of miles to the northeast of the warehouse. Overall, the tornado was rated EF3 with a path length of 4.22 miles and max path width of 300 yards. Six deaths and one injured were reported.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado continued east northeast just along Brown|Bridge Road, snapping a few trees and blowing down a fence along|Glynshire Ct and Roberts Rd.  The tornado reached peak intensity|of 90mph as it hit Veterans Middle school removing significant|amounts of siding and roofing from the gymnasium and sections of|roof.

The tornado initially produced EF-1 damage but while progressing northeast, it continued to strengthen to EF-3 as it approached Dresden. Several buildings and homes in downtown Dresden suffered significant damage or were completely destroyed. The tornado slightly weakened and moved northeast toward Paris Landing and eventually crossed the Tennessee River. 5 people were injured in west Tennessee. The tornado clipped the Fort Donelson National Battlefield area of extreme southeastern Calloway County, Kentucky where it blew down several trees, then crossed the Tennessee River into the Land Between the Lakes area of Stewart County and did massive tree damage to heavily wooded areas uprooting thousands of trees along its path. The tornado struck a well constructed single family brick home near Bear Creek where it took off the roof and top story. It then continued to travel northeast where it passed Indian Branch and Morgan Branch where it continued to uproot trees and destroyed some farm outbuildings, lifted the roofs off of some single and double wide mobile homes and completely flattened some barns and single wide structures. The most widespread and severe damage in Stewart County was between Indian Branch and Morgan Branch to the south of Bumpus Mills. The tornado then continued northeast across the far northwest corner of Fort Campbell Army Base continuing to blow down trees before moving into Kentucky. The tornado received a maximum rating of EF2 in Stewart County, and 4 people were injured. The tornado passed just south of the city of Lafayette, Kentucky where it immediately struck a barn and knocked down several electrical transmission lines. The tornado tracked northeast over mostly open country before causing significant damage to several homes off of Boddie Road and Darnell Road. More significant damage occurred to several homes, farm outbuildings, and structures on Palmyra Road. A mobile home was completely demolished and significant roofing damage was done to a brick home on Herndon Oak Grove Road. As the tornado approached Interstate 24, mostly tree damage was observed with a few structures impacted as well. Once the tornado crossed Fort Campbell Blvd, additional damage to electrical transmission lines was observed including over a dozen wood poles snapped. The tornado continued northeast causing mostly tree damage before completely destroying four tobacco barns and damaging three equipment garages off of Bradshaw Road. Two other buildings were also heavily damaged along with multiple silos destroyed. Damage estimates were in the millions according to the owners for just this one farm. The tornado then took straight aim for the city of Pembroke where significant tree damage was observed along with multiple houses with roof damage. Once the tornado moved out of Pembroke, two mobile homes were completely destroyed with the occupants injured. The tornado then crossed into Todd County where mostly tree damage and damage to farm/outbuildings were observed. The tornado then lifted just before impacting the city of Elkton where straight-line winds became dominant. The tornado received a maximum rating of EF2 in Christian County and EF1 in Todd County, and 4 people were injured.

A highly-sheared environment combined with increasing instability produced numerous tornadic thunderstorms. Severe parameters were supportive of significant and long-track supercells, prompting the issuance of a rare High Risk Convective Outlook from the Storm Prediction Center for portions of Central Alabama.||A total of 10 tornado tracks were surveyed in Central Alabama. This included 4 EF3 tornadoes, 3 EF2 tornadoes, and 3 EF1 tornadoes. Damage was significant along the paths of the most intense tornadoes and, unfortunately, injuries and fatalities occurred. |Some storms were cyclic, meaning multiple tornadoes were produced by the same storm. The most impressive tornado of the event was the long-track tornado that traveled nearly 80 miles from Hale County to Shelby County. This ranked as the seventh longest single tornado track in the state of Alabama.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in Calhoun County and determined that it was consistent with an EF3 tornado, with maximum winds near 140 mph.||The tornado first touched down on Boiling Springs Road snapping and uprooting trees just north of Mitchellville Road. The tornado widened as it traveled northeast damaging structures along Boiling Springs Road, downing trees and power lines. A double wide mobile home was demolished on Simpson Bend Road. The tornado then produced extensive damage in the Macon community, destroying numerous mobile homes with moderate to major damage to several site built homes. In this area, tree damage was also extensive with numerous hardwoods snapped near the base along Ragan Chapel Road.  As the tornado approached Highway 77, it reached its maximum intensity and was likely multi-vortex in nature based on the damage pattern. Here, a large swath of trees were snapped. A large factory, Precision Materials, sustained major damage. The entire structure and supporting frame of this large well built metal building was collapsed and bent inward. The owner said they received the tornado warning and moved all employees into a safe shelter in the interior of the building before the tornado hit. None of the occupants were injured. A large tractor trailer at this location was also partially lofted and then dragged 60 feet. The damage at this location was rated EF-3 . The tornado crossed County Road 77, with damage to several homes along Ragans Chapel Road. At least two homes sustained significant damage with most of their roof removed and windows blown out. A large farm building was also demolished. Ragans Chapel UMC, a structure dating back to the late 1800s, sustained major damage with most walls collapsed. The caretaker���s home behind the church sustained major damage.||Along Mudd Street, several mobile homes were completely destroyed. A fatality occurred in one unanchored tiny home when the structure completely collapsed. Additional site built homes in the area from Mudd Street to Lost Creek Road sustained significant damage. The tornado continued northeast over mainly forested areas snapping and uprooting large swaths of trees. A wide expanse of damage was noted from Dark Hollow Road and Boiling Springs Road. Here many power lines were downed and poles snapped. Several site built homes sustained roof and structural damage, farm buildings and sheds were destroyed, and a mobile home was completely destroyed.||Significant damage was noted along Ingram Wells Road and Grayton Road South. Along Ingram Wells Road several homes were damaged and outbuildings destroyed. Along Grayton Road several mobile homes were destroyed with the undercarriages and contents blown well downstream. A doublewide mobile home also sustained significant damage. Three fatalities occurred here along with multiple significant injuries. A wide swath of tree damage continued along Grayton Road South and Mountain View Road.||The tornado then moved into the Wellington community as it crossed US Highway 431. Here several site built homes sustained moderate damage with partial loss of roof structures. Many power poles were also snapped along with damage to a convenience store. Significant damage was noted along Joe Martin Drive and Wellington Road. One site built home sustained collapse of most walls and cars were tossed. Six occupants sheltered safely in an interior closet. Additional homes sustained roof damage with one moved well off its foundation. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed. One occupant was killed near Mangum Road, but 13 others survived after sheltering in a family storm pit.||A wide swath of damage continued from East Wellington into Pleasant Valley with mobile homes destroyed along Old Sulphur Springs Road and site built homes with roof and structural damage. Trees were snapped and uprooted along County Road 204 along with damage to structures. Chicken houses were destroyed along Pleasant Valley Road, along with substantial damage to a church and business along Angel Drive. The tornado continued northeastward where additional damage was observed along Nisbet Lake Road, Dogwood Lane, and Charlie Penny Road. This was mostly timber damage where the tornado uprooted and snapped hundreds of trees. Varying degrees of minor structure damage was observed here as well. Farther northeast, the tornado moved toward New Liberty and Roy Webb Rd where damage was sustained at Learning Tree. The tornado continued northeast crossing Old Piedmont Gadsden Highway and US Hwy 278. Several swaths of timber damage was observed throughout these areas as well as minor damage to a few homes.

A highly-sheared environment combined with increasing instability produced numerous tornadic thunderstorms. Severe parameters were supportive of significant and long-track supercells, prompting the issuance of a rare High Risk Convective Outlook from the Storm Prediction Center for portions of Central Alabama.||A total of 10 tornado tracks were surveyed in Central Alabama. This included 4 EF3 tornadoes, 3 EF2 tornadoes, and 3 EF1 tornadoes. Damage was significant along the paths of the most intense tornadoes and, unfortunately, injuries and fatalities occurred. |Some storms were cyclic, meaning multiple tornadoes were produced by the same storm. The most impressive tornado of the event was the long-track tornado that traveled nearly 80 miles from Hale County to Shelby County. This ranked as the seventh longest single tornado track in the state of Alabama.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in Calhoun County and determined that it was consistent with an EF3 tornado, with maximum winds near 140 mph.||The tornado first touched down on Boiling Springs Road snapping and uprooting trees just north of Mitchellville Road. The tornado widened as it traveled northeast damaging structures along Boiling Springs Road, downing trees and power lines. A double wide mobile home was demolished on Simpson Bend Road. The tornado then produced extensive damage in the Macon community, destroying numerous mobile homes with moderate to major damage to several site built homes. In this area, tree damage was also extensive with numerous hardwoods snapped near the base along Ragan Chapel Road.  As the tornado approached Highway 77, it reached its maximum intensity and was likely multi-vortex in nature based on the damage pattern. Here, a large swath of trees were snapped. A large factory, Precision Materials, sustained major damage. The entire structure and supporting frame of this large well built metal building was collapsed and bent inward. The owner said they received the tornado warning and moved all employees into a safe shelter in the interior of the building before the tornado hit. None of the occupants were injured. A large tractor trailer at this location was also partially lofted and then dragged 60 feet. The damage at this location was rated EF-3 . The tornado crossed County Road 77, with damage to several homes along Ragans Chapel Road. At least two homes sustained significant damage with most of their roof removed and windows blown out. A large farm building was also demolished. Ragans Chapel UMC, a structure dating back to the late 1800s, sustained major damage with most walls collapsed. The caretaker���s home behind the church sustained major damage.||Along Mudd Street, several mobile homes were completely destroyed. A fatality occurred in one unanchored tiny home when the structure completely collapsed. Additional site built homes in the area from Mudd Street to Lost Creek Road sustained significant damage. The tornado continued northeast over mainly forested areas snapping and uprooting large swaths of trees. A wide expanse of damage was noted from Dark Hollow Road and Boiling Springs Road. Here many power lines were downed and poles snapped. Several site built homes sustained roof and structural damage, farm buildings and sheds were destroyed, and a mobile home was completely destroyed.||Significant damage was noted along Ingram Wells Road and Grayton Road South. Along Ingram Wells Road several homes were damaged and outbuildings destroyed. Along Grayton Road several mobile homes were destroyed with the undercarriages and contents blown well downstream. A doublewide mobile home also sustained significant damage. Three fatalities occurred here along with multiple significant injuries. A wide swath of tree damage continued along Grayton Road South and Mountain View Road.||The tornado then moved into the Wellington community as it crossed US Highway 431. Here several site built homes sustained moderate damage with partial loss of roof structures. Many power poles were also snapped along with damage to a convenience store. Significant damage was noted along Joe Martin Drive and Wellington Road. One site built home sustained collapse of most walls and cars were tossed. Six occupants sheltered safely in an interior closet. Additional homes sustained roof damage with one moved well off its foundation. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed. One occupant was killed near Mangum Road, but 13 others survived after sheltering in a family storm pit.||A wide swath of damage continued from East Wellington into Pleasant Valley with mobile homes destroyed along Old Sulphur Springs Road and site built homes with roof and structural damage. Trees were snapped and uprooted along County Road 204 along with damage to structures. Chicken houses were destroyed along Pleasant Valley Road, along with substantial damage to a church and business along Angel Drive. The tornado continued northeastward where additional damage was observed along Nisbet Lake Road, Dogwood Lane, and Charlie Penny Road. This was mostly timber damage where the tornado uprooted and snapped hundreds of trees. Varying degrees of minor structure damage was observed here as well. Farther northeast, the tornado moved toward New Liberty and Roy Webb Rd where damage was sustained at Learning Tree. The tornado continued northeast crossing Old Piedmont Gadsden Highway and US Hwy 278. Several swaths of timber damage was observed throughout these areas as well as minor damage to a few homes. The tornado crossed into southern Cherokee County just west of Highway 9.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Ida made landfall across southeast Louisiana during the late morning on August 29th. Ida turned north and northeast across central Mississippi during late afternoon and evening on Monday, August 30th. ||The core of the hurricane force winds was relatively small, only extending out from the center about 50 miles. However tropical storm force winds extended outward over 150 miles from the center. This brought tropical storm force wind gusts to southeast Mississippi and much of southwest Alabama, with a brief period of sustained tropical storm force winds to coastal Alabama. Wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph were recorded  across southeast Mississippi and southwestern Alabama. The tropical storm force winds also downed several trees across the area.||The highest storm surge inundation values observed were between 3 to 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. Storm surge surveys indicated the highest water levels were in the Bayou La Batre area along and near Shell Belt Road where peak water levels were in the 4 to 4.5 feet MHHW range. ||The slow movement of the storm caused widespread flooding especially across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. Rainfall amounts of anywhere from 7 to 12 inches were recorded across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. This led to significant flash flooding along with significant river flooding.||Two tornadoes during the afternoon on August 30th. An EF-1 in northern Mobile County and an EF-1 in southern Clarke County.||Here is a breakdown of county impacts:||Stone County MS: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed several trees in Stone|County. Seven to ten inches of rain was recorded and one road had to be barricaded due to flooding. The low lying red creek and mill creek areas experienced flooding, impacting two RV parks.||George County MS: Eight to twelve inches of rain fell across George county which|resulted in significant flash flooding. A portion of Highway 26 collapsed just west of Lucedale, killing three people and injuring seven others. Eleven other roads were significantly flooded and had some form of washout or damage.||Mobile County AL: The west end of Dauphin Island was significantly impacted by Ida|from a combination of high surf, storm surge, and tropical storm force winds. Three miles of Bienville boulevard was impassable due to surge flooding and sand up to four feet deep. The high surf also produced minor damage to a few homes on the west end. Power poles were also knocked down on the island. Storm surge inundation peaked|between 3 and 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. The highest tidal gauge readings were 3.78 feet MHHW at Coast Guard sector Mobile and 3.82 feet MHHW at the Bayou La Batre bridge. Storm surge surveys along Shell Belt road in Bayou La Batre indicated water lines that reached between 4-4.5 feet.||This surge flooding resulted in closures of low lying coastal roads, such as Shell Belt road, the US Highway 90 causeway, the foot of the Dog river bridge, and the Dauphin Island causeway. Coastal flooding persisted across three high tide cycles which resulted in prolonged closures. Observations at Dauphin Island and Buccaneer Yacht Club on|Mobile Bay measured brief sustained periods of tropical storm force winds between 40-45 mph. Gusts of 50 to 60 mph were recorded in heavier rain bands across central and southern Mobile county. An EF-1 tornado impacted parts of Saraland, Satsuma, and Creola early in the afternoon on August 30th, resulting in three injuries. Rainfall|totals of 8 to 11 inches were recorded across the county, especially in southern and central portions. This heavy rainfall led to some urban flooding in neighborhoods and damaged some drainage culverts.||Baldwin County AL: Storm surge inundation of 3 to 4 feet above normally dry ground was recorded from Weeks Bay northward. This resulted in flooding of low lying areas and closure of the US Highway 90 Causeway. Five to nine inches of rain was measured across Baldwin county, which resulted in areas of flash flooding. A portion of River Road along Styx River was washed out due to heavy rainfall and flooding. A few drainage culverts were also significant damaged in the county. Tropical storm conditions were confined primarily to immediate coastal areas, particularly along the Fort Morgan peninsula.||Clarke County AL: An EF-1 Tornado impacted portions of southern Clarke County, significantly damaging a couple of structures.||Escambia County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand on coastal roadways along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for an extended period of time.||Santa Rosa County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for and extended period of time.||Okaloosa County FL: Strong rip currents produced by Ida resulted in two rip current fatalities in the wake of the storm. One occurred on September 1st when a 14 year old teen drowned off a Destin Beach. The other fatality occurred on September 4th when a 58 year old man drowned off Henderson Beach State Park.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado began at approximately 12:20 PM at the intersection of highway|158 and highway 43 where trees were uprooted and a few pines snapped. As the|tornado moved northeast along highway 43 it produced sporadic damage to trees.|The roof of a motel on the west side of highway 43 was uplifted and partially|removed. As the tornado crossed 43 the most intense damage occured where several|sections of another motel\`s roof was removed, one person had minor injuries at the|motel. Due to the roofs older build and lack of tree damage, a lower bound estimate|was used. The tornado continued northeast and crossed Jackintoport Blvd. where the|roof of an open sided industrial building was partially removed and an 18 wheeler|was overturned. Another injury occured with the overturned tractor trailer. Tree|damage became sporadic and the path may have been discontinuous until several|softwood trees were uprooted or snapped along Bayou Sara Ave. The tornado likely,|continued northeast along Gunnison Creek and damage was found as the tornado crossed|near Boboshilly Cir. This was where the most significant tree damage was noted with|several snapped softwood pines. The tornado continued northeast towards I-65 where|a couple trees were uprooted onto a home along Ellison Ave before likely dissipating|north of Dead Lake Marina Rd. Most of the damage indicators appeared right of the track and based off radar estimates the tornado could have possibly continued further into the Mobile delta.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The near continuous damage path started near Plainfield-Naperville Road and Sheppey Court where considerable tree damage occurred.  Significant tree damage began just east of Modaff Road with trees snapped and others uprooted along Quall Drive.  Significant tree damage occurred near Verdin Lane with trees uprooted, trunks snapped and large tree limbs broken and tossed into homes.

The tornado was on the ground for 128 miles within the NWS Paducah forecast area, and the total path length was about 165 miles from Obion County, TN to Breckinridge County, KY. Another long-track EF-3 tornado started in Dyer County, TN, and traveled about 125 miles through northwest Tennessee and into Christian and Todd Counties in western Kentucky. A strong upper-level trough over the western Plains induced a deepening surface low that tracked northeast across the Iowa/Illinois border. A very strong and deep southwest wind flow brought moist and unstable air into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Record high temperatures were recorded, including a high of 73 at Paducah. The combination of very strong winds aloft, unseasonably warm conditions, and a strong low pressure system were ideal for this tornado outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This historic EF-4 tornado was associated with a very long-track supercell that originally formed over eastern Arkansas. The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell). This tornado crossed from Obion County, Tennessee into Fulton County, Kentucky about 6 miles southeast of Hickman, close to the communities of State Line, KY and Woodland Mills, TN. The tornado rapidly widened, becoming over a mile wide across northeast Fulton County. The primary impact to Fulton County was on the community of Cayce, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This community was the site of the only fatality in Fulton County. A 57-year-old male occupant of a mobile home was killed. On the southwest edge of Cayce, a house was demolished (DI 2, DOD 9). This demolished house was assigned an estimated wind speed of 170 mph, the highest in the county. A small retail building in the center of town was demolished (DI 8, DOD 8). A total of 61 structures were affected in Fulton County, with 21 of those totally destroyed or uninhabitable. A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some farm equipment. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the Cayce area. The average path width was a mile. The tornado exited Fulton County into Hickman County in a rural area about 7 miles northwest of Fulton.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on the beginning of this tornado). This tornado crossed from Hickman County into Graves County about one-half mile north of where Highway 58 crosses the county line, close to the tiny community of Baltimore. The tornado was about 1.3 miles wide when it entered the county. It varied from 1 to 1.3 miles in width as it traversed Graves County. The primary impact to Graves County was on the city of Mayfield, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This city suffered a devastating impact, in terms of both loss of life and property destruction. There were 23 fatalities countywide and many more injuries. On the southwest edge of Mayfield as the tornado entered the city, a candle factory was demolished (DI 23, DOD 7). At least nine workers in the factory were killed. The tornado continued northeast through the heart of Mayfield at 9:28 PM CST, averaging just over one mile in width. The downtown area was directly impacted, crippling the police and fire department headquarters and emergency communications. Residential neighborhoods both southwest and northeast of downtown were destroyed. Numerous businesses in the downtown business district collapsed. Several damage sites in the city of Mayfield received a wind speed estimate of 188 mph, the highest in the county. Many of the structures were historic brick buildings (DI 17, DOD 7). At least 1,500 structures were damaged or destroyed, including a couple hundred businesses. The Red Cross estimated that 730 dwellings were uninhabitable. A large number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some farm equipment in rural areas outside the city. Nearly total tree destruction was observed. The first EF-4 damage in the county was noted at and around the candle factory on the southwest side of Mayfield. Near the candle factory, a house was swept clean off the concrete slab (DI 2, DOD 10). The last EF-4 damage points in the county were on the northeast side of Mayfield, including a nursing home (DI 7, DOD 7). After entering Graves County, the tornado intersected I-69 (formerly the Purchase Parkway) four miles southwest of the Mayfield city limit. A wind gust to 93 knots or 107 mph was measured at the University of Kentucky mesonet site 6 miles southwest of Mayfield. The tornado then closely followed Interstate 69 northeast all the way to Marshall County. The tornado crossed the interstate multiple times. The first crossing was two miles southwest of Mayfield, then again northeast of Mayfield just east of the Highway 131 interchange, and again at the Marshall County line. The interstate was blocked in spots by trees, power lines, and debris. From Highway 131 to Highway 301 northeast of Mayfield, the tornado followed the exact same path as the May 10, 2016 EF-3 tornado. Some of the same structures that were damaged in that tornado were destroyed by this tornado. The tornado exited Graves County into Marshall County along Interstate 69 (formerly the Purchase Parkway) where it crosses the county line.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A violent EF-4 tornado began in far northwest Tennessee, and moved across western Kentucky, resulting in dozens of lost lives and a swath of destruction. The tornado was on the ground for 128 miles within the NWS Paducah forecast area, and the total path length was about 165 miles from Obion County, TN to Breckinridge County, KY. Another long-track EF-3 tornado started in Dyer County, TN, and traveled about 125 miles through northwest Tennessee and into Christian and Todd Counties in western Kentucky. A strong upper-level trough over the western Plains induced a deepening surface low that tracked northeast across the Iowa/Illinois border. A very strong and deep southwest wind flow brought moist and unstable air into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Record high temperatures were recorded, including a high of 73 at Paducah. The combination of very strong winds aloft, unseasonably warm conditions, and a strong low pressure system were ideal for this tornado outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This historic EF-4 tornado was associated with a very long-track supercell that originally formed over eastern Arkansas. The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on the beginning of this tornado). This tornado crossed from Hickman County into Graves County about one-half mile north of where Highway 58 crosses the county line, close to the tiny community of Baltimore. The tornado was about 1.3 miles wide when it entered the county. It varied from 1 to 1.3 miles in width as it traversed Graves County. The primary impact to Graves County was on the city of Mayfield, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This city suffered a devastating impact, in terms of both loss of life and property destruction. There were 23 fatalities countywide and many more injuries. On the southwest edge of Mayfield as the tornado entered the city, a candle factory was demolished (DI 23, DOD 7). At least nine workers in the factory were killed. The tornado continued northeast through the heart of Mayfield at 9:28 PM CST, averaging just over one mile in width. The downtown area was directly impacted, crippling the police and fire department headquarters and emergency communications. Residential neighborhoods both southwest and northeast of downtown were destroyed. Numerous businesses in the downtown business district collapsed. Several damage sites in the city of Mayfield received a wind speed estimate of 188 mph, the highest in the county. Many of the structures were historic brick buildings (DI 17, DOD 7). At least 1,500 structures were damaged or destroyed, including a couple hundred businesses. The Red Cross estimated that 730 dwellings were uninhabitable. A large number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some farm equipment in rural areas outside the city. Nearly total tree destruction was observed. The first EF-4 damage in the county was noted at and around the candle factory on the southwest side of Mayfield. Near the candle factory, a house was swept clean off the concrete slab (DI 2, DOD 10). The last EF-4 damage points in the county were on the northeast side of Mayfield, including a nursing home (DI 7, DOD 7). After entering Graves County, the tornado intersected I-69 (formerly the Purchase Parkway) four miles southwest of the Mayfield city limit. A wind gust to 93 knots or 107 mph was measured at the University of Kentucky mesonet site 6 miles southwest of Mayfield. The tornado then closely followed Interstate 69 northeast all the way to Marshall County. The tornado crossed the interstate multiple times. The first crossing was two miles southwest of Mayfield, then again northeast of Mayfield just east of the Highway 131 interchange, and again at the Marshall County line. The interstate was blocked in spots by trees, power lines, and debris. From Highway 131 to Highway 301 northeast of Mayfield, the tornado followed the exact same path as the May 10, 2016 EF-3 tornado. Some of the same structures that were damaged in that tornado were destroyed by this tornado. The tornado exited Graves County into Marshall County along Interstate 69 (formerly the Purchase Parkway) where it crosses the county line.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This tornado crossed from Graves County into Marshall County along Interstate 69 about seven miles west-southwest of Benton. The tornado  widened to nearly 1.5 miles (2450 yards) soon after crossing into Marshall County. The tornado width fluctuated from 0.8 mile to nearly 1.5 miles during its trek across the county. The community most impacted was Cambridge Shores, a rather dense subdivision of vacation homes and some luxury homes on Kentucky Lake. This is the only location in Marshall County where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This community was the site of the only fatalities in Marshall County. A 78-year-old female resident died in the hallway of her house. Another elderly woman died of a heart attack while trying to remove debris (indirect). There were numerous homes in Cambridge Shores that were levelled, including the loss of all walls (DI 2, DOD 9). Some homes were wiped off the foundation. Marshall County's highest wind speed estimate of 170 mph was assigned to the damage in the Cambridge Shores area. A total of 356 structures in Marshall County were destroyed or uninhabitable. Another 341 structures sustained light to moderate damage. A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some that landed in Kentucky Lake. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the Cambridge Shores area. After crossing into Marshall County, the tornado path stayed over Interstate 69 from the county line to about three miles west of Benton. In this area a few miles west of Benton, a home was blown off its foundation and a few other homes were demolished (DI 2, DOD 9). The tornado narrowly missed the county seat of Benton, passing only a mile or two northwest of the downtown area. Where the tornado crossed U.S. 641 just north of Benton, a home was destroyed with the exception of some interior walls (DI 2, DOD 8). The tornado crossed U.S. Highway 68 about one mile southeast of the county high school, then continued on to Cambridge Shores. The tornado exited Marshall County into Lyon County over Kentucky Lake, about 1.5 miles east-northeast of Cambridge Shores.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A violent EF-4 tornado began in far northwest Tennessee, and moved across western Kentucky, resulting in dozens of lost lives and a swath of destruction. The tornado was on the ground for 128 miles within the NWS Paducah forecast area, and the total path length was about 165 miles from Obion County, TN to Breckinridge County, KY. Another long-track EF-3 tornado started in Dyer County, TN, and traveled about 125 miles through northwest Tennessee and into Christian and Todd Counties in western Kentucky. A strong upper-level trough over the western Plains induced a deepening surface low that tracked northeast across the Iowa/Illinois border. A very strong and deep southwest wind flow brought moist and unstable air into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Record high temperatures were recorded, including a high of 73 at Paducah. The combination of very strong winds aloft, unseasonably warm conditions, and a strong low pressure system were ideal for this tornado outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This historic EF-4 tornado was associated with a very long-track supercell that originally formed over eastern Arkansas. The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell). This tornado crossed from Marshall County into Lyon County, Kentucky near the Hillman Ferry Campground in the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area. The tornado crossed the Trace Highway causing near complete tree destruction and broke one wooden electrical transmission line (DI 24, DOD 4). The tornado achieved its highest rating of EF-3 as it emerged from Lake Barkley just north of Eddy Creek. Numerous homes were completely destroyed (DI 2, DOD 9) between the shore and Interstate 24 near Mile Marker 46. The damage rating of a house in this area corresponded with a wind speed of 150 mph, the highest in the county. The tornado continued to the county line producing mainly tree damage with occasional structural damage. A 98-year-old female occupant died of injuries incurred in her home south of Eddyville.  In addition, 5 others were injured throughout Lyon county. A total of 141 structures were affected in Lyon County, with 45 of those totally destroyed or uninhabitable. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the Land Between the Lakes area. The average path width was a mile. The tornado exited Lyon County into Caldwell County in a rural area about 7 miles east southeast of Eddyville.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell).  This tornado crossed from Caldwell County into Hopkins County near the city limit of Dawson Springs, which straddles the county line. The tornado produced catastrophic damage and some fatalities in Dawson Springs. About two-thirds of the city's homes were destroyed, and about a dozen fatalities occurred. There were at least 200 injuries. The core of the tornado narrowly missed the downtown Dawson Springs business district, but a large residential neighborhood on the north side of downtown was destroyed. This neighborhood is where the tornado obtained its maximum EF-4 rating in Hopkins County. A two-story apartment building was almost totally destroyed. Only a few first-story interior walls remained standing (DI 5, DOD 6). This apartment building is where the damage was assigned a wind speed estimate of 180 mph, the highest in the county. On the northern edge of town, over a dozen duplexes suffered complete roof loss. All exterior and interior walls of one of the units collapsed (DI 2, DOD 9). Most of the single-family homes suffered complete roof loss and the loss of most exterior walls (DI 2, DOD 8). In a few cases, there was complete destruction of residences (DI 2, DOD 10). On Highway 109 on the northeast side of town, a large retail structure with a long-span roof was destroyed (DI 12, DOD 7). Nearby, about a half dozen other smaller homes and businesses were demolished, including the loss of all walls (DI 9, DOD 9). Once the tornado exited the Dawson Springs area, it crossed Interstate 69 (formerly the Western Kentucky Parkway) about three miles northeast of Dawson Springs. A clearly defined wide path of nearly total tree destruction crossed the interstate. A house near the interstate suffered the loss of the roof and most walls, except for a few walls of small interior rooms (DI 2, DOD 8). Where the tornado crossed Highway 112, a few single-family homes were demolished, including the loss of the roof and all or most walls (DI 2, DOD 8-9). The tornado continued across heavily forested land until reaching Barnsley, a small community between Earlington and Mortons Gap on U.S. Highway 41. Several houses were demolished, including the loss of all walls (DI 2, DOD 9). In addition, a train was derailed and a 55-foot tanker car was thrown 20 yards from the railroad tracks (DI 29, DOD 1). The tornado then continued through a long swath of forest before crossing Interstate 69 midway between Madisonville and the Western Kentucky Parkway. Hundreds of trees were snapped at this interstate crossing (DI 27, DOD 4). A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed across the county. The total number of affected structures countywide was estimated near 1000. A little over 500 structures were completely destroyed. Nearly total tree destruction was observed all along the path. The average path width was a mile. The tornado exited Hopkins County across the Pond River into Muhlenberg County about 6.5 miles east-southeast of Madisonville.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A very strong and deep southwest wind flow brought moist and unstable air into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Record high temperatures were recorded, including a high of 73 at Paducah. The combination of very strong winds aloft, unseasonably warm conditions, and a strong low pressure system were ideal for this tornado outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This historic EF-4 tornado was associated with a very long-track supercell that originally formed over eastern Arkansas. The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell).  This tornado crossed from Caldwell County into Hopkins County near the city limit of Dawson Springs, which straddles the county line. The tornado produced catastrophic damage and some fatalities in Dawson Springs. About two-thirds of the city's homes were destroyed, and about a dozen fatalities occurred. There were at least 200 injuries. The core of the tornado narrowly missed the downtown Dawson Springs business district, but a large residential neighborhood on the north side of downtown was destroyed. This neighborhood is where the tornado obtained its maximum EF-4 rating in Hopkins County. A two-story apartment building was almost totally destroyed. Only a few first-story interior walls remained standing (DI 5, DOD 6). This apartment building is where the damage was assigned a wind speed estimate of 180 mph, the highest in the county. On the northern edge of town, over a dozen duplexes suffered complete roof loss. All exterior and interior walls of one of the units collapsed (DI 2, DOD 9). Most of the single-family homes suffered complete roof loss and the loss of most exterior walls (DI 2, DOD 8). In a few cases, there was complete destruction of residences (DI 2, DOD 10). On Highway 109 on the northeast side of town, a large retail structure with a long-span roof was destroyed (DI 12, DOD 7). Nearby, about a half dozen other smaller homes and businesses were demolished, including the loss of all walls (DI 9, DOD 9). Once the tornado exited the Dawson Springs area, it crossed Interstate 69 (formerly the Western Kentucky Parkway) about three miles northeast of Dawson Springs. A clearly defined wide path of nearly total tree destruction crossed the interstate. A house near the interstate suffered the loss of the roof and most walls, except for a few walls of small interior rooms (DI 2, DOD 8). Where the tornado crossed Highway 112, a few single-family homes were demolished, including the loss of the roof and all or most walls (DI 2, DOD 8-9). The tornado continued across heavily forested land until reaching Barnsley, a small community between Earlington and Mortons Gap on U.S. Highway 41. Several houses were demolished, including the loss of all walls (DI 2, DOD 9). In addition, a train was derailed and a 55-foot tanker car was thrown 20 yards from the railroad tracks (DI 29, DOD 1). The tornado then continued through a long swath of forest before crossing Interstate 69 midway between Madisonville and the Western Kentucky Parkway. Hundreds of trees were snapped at this interstate crossing (DI 27, DOD 4). A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed across the county. The total number of affected structures countywide was estimated near 1000. A little over 500 structures were completely destroyed. Nearly total tree destruction was observed all along the path. The average path width was a mile. The tornado exited Hopkins County across the Pond River into Muhlenberg County about 6.5 miles east-southeast of Madisonville.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell). This tornado crossed from Hopkins County into Muhlenberg County at the Pond River, about 8 miles southwest of Bremen.  The primary impact to Muhlenberg County was in and around the community of Bremen, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. The Bremen area was the site of most of the 11 fatalities in Muhlenberg County. A total of 165 structures were damaged or destroyed, of which 84 were completely destroyed or uninhabitable. The remainder were damaged at least moderately. The majority of these structures were along and just south of Highway 175 from 5 miles southwest of Bremen to the community of Bremen. Several demolished houses in this area warranted a rating of EF-4. The destruction of one house warranted a wind speed estimate of 190 mph, the highest in the county and the entire track. One brick home on Highway 175 collapsed, and another was swept off the foundation (DI 2, DOD 9). A car in the garage was thrown across the road. A couple of poorly anchored houses were swept clean off the foundation within a few miles west of Bremen (DI 2, DOD 9-10). On the north side of Bremen, a two-story home was completely destroyed. The  foundation was not swept clean, but all walls were gone. Much of the remainder of the path through Muhlenberg County was unpopulated woods and fields. There was a cluster of damaged or destroyed structures near the community of Moorman, near where the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 431. In this area, a couple houses were heavily damaged, but most walls remained standing (DI 2, DOD 6). A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed countywide, including some farm equipment.

Central Kentucky saw 18 tornadoes that injured 96 and killed 18. An additional death occurred in a flash flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado formed approximately 1 mile southwest of Crossroads near Watlington Road and tracked northeast for approximately 22 miles before crossing into western Warren County. The tornado continued approximately 6 miles into Warren County before dissipating at 0114 CST. In Logan County, the supercell that had cycled down its tornado in eastern Todd County (but continued to produce wind damage northeast of Elkton) spun back up again soon after crossing the border into western Logan County. It quickly ramped up to EF-3 (140 mph) intensity with a damage swath roughly three quarters of a mile wide along Milton Sharp Rd. On the southern side, a family was home when a 2 by 4 narrowly missed the husband as the roof was being peeled off the middle of the house. On the north side, a large dairy farm was completely destroyed. As the tornado continued northeast, a wide swath of trees was snapped/uprooted along the edge of a forest on the southern edge of the vortex, while on the north edge a well built home had its second floor two-thirds thrown off. A male was in the other section when a 2 by 4 from the first floor came up and got lodged in his mattress. Another well built log cabin in this area lost its second floor roof. The tornado then turned more ENE in the Buena Vista Rd area. A doublewide manufactured home was completely destroyed here along with several outbuildings on the property. A male at the home received warning from family and heard the tornado approach, getting into a bath tub in the middle of the east side of the structure. After it hit, the home blew into a row of trees and the male remembers grabbing onto a tree southeast of his original location. He sustained injuries as medics had to get wood out of his legs. The tornado continued over to Lakewood Ln where a boy was in the second story of a house when the window imploded inward and moved the bed he was in. After this, the storm crossed US 431, impacting several trees along Hwy 1040 with EF1 level winds. It then moved to a row of mobile homes along H.C. Johnson Rd. Two of these homes were completely destroyed, with one blown into a row of trees south of its original point and another lifted up and over a tree just east of its original location. This may have been a mesovortex spinning around the main circulation. The tornado damage was widest at this location, roughly 0.8 mile. On the south side of the tornado, a mobile home was completely destroyed along Hwy 915 where it was spread out over the road. The resident was a female whose father insisted she stay the night at his place, with a basement, after hearing the messaging in the days before. That same mesovortex may have been what caused the collapse of an electric transmission line just east of Marshall Rd where there was little damage to surrounding trees. Farther north on that road a well built brick home had its roof taken off as well as the carport removed. The tornado continued to track along Hwy 79 towards the Chandlers Chapel area where the Methodist Church lost its steeple and had damage to several of the stained glass windows. A couple of homes had major damage here. A resident said he had at least 20 minutes of warning lead time ahead of the touchdown. There was additional damage along Turner Road and then 3 Poplars Rd. This survey ended soon after 3 Poplars Rd. Another survey was conducted in the far northeast corner of Logan County where a couple of long chicken barns were leveled.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A male at the home received warning from family and heard the tornado approach, getting into a bath tub in the middle of the east side of the structure. After it hit, the home blew into a row of trees and the male remembers grabbing onto a tree southeast of his original location. He sustained injuries as medics had to get wood out of his legs. The tornado continued over to Lakewood Ln where a boy was in the second story of a house when the window imploded inward and moved the bed he was in. After this, the storm crossed US 431, impacting several trees along Hwy 1040 with EF1 level winds. It then moved to a row of mobile homes along H.C. Johnson Rd. Two of these homes were completely destroyed, with one blown into a row of trees south of its original point and another lifted up and over a tree just east of its original location. This may have been a mesovortex spinning around the main circulation. The tornado damage was widest at this location, roughly 0.8 mile. On the south side of the tornado, a mobile home was completely destroyed along Hwy 915 where it was spread out over the road. The resident was a female whose father insisted she stay the night at his place, with a basement, after hearing the messaging in the days before. That same mesovortex may have been what caused the collapse of an electric transmission line just east of Marshall Rd where there was little damage to surrounding trees. Farther north on that road a well built brick home had its roof taken off as well as the carport removed. The tornado continued to track along Hwy 79 towards the Chandlers Chapel area where the Methodist Church lost its steeple and had damage to several of the stained glass windows. A couple of homes had major damage here. A resident said he had at least 20 minutes of warning lead time ahead of the touchdown. There was additional damage along Turner Road and then 3 Poplars Rd. This survey ended soon after 3 Poplars Rd. Another survey was conducted in the far northeast corner of Logan County where a couple of long chicken barns were leveled.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This resulted in unusually warm temperatures for a December day and the ingredients to produce a historic tornado outbreak and flash flooding. This included multiple long track tornadoes. Central Kentucky saw 18 tornadoes that injured 96 and killed 18. An additional death occurred in a flash flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The National Weather Service in Louisville surveyed a tornadic supercell over the course of 6 days in Warren County which directly struck Bowling Green. The tornado first touched down in rural southwestern Warren County just south of the intersection of Wimpee Smith Road and Petros Browning Rd. It tracked to the northeast for approximately 26 miles before entering Edmonson County. The tornado continued approximately 3.6 miles into Edmonson before dissipating at 0138 CST. At the tornado's beginning in Warren County, the tornado twisted, snapped, topped and uprooted softwood and hardwood trees. The tornado was about 200 yards wide, with EF1 winds of 90 mph. Aerial photography confirmed the tornado was continuous in this rugged area of southwest Warren County. The tornado increased to EF2, between 120 and 125 mph, doing major damage to several older barns along Tommy Smith Road. It threw a 1700 pound cattle trailer, 300 yards into a creek ravine.The NWS drone showed a distinct narrow main funnel within the larger funnel. This 30 to 35 yard funnel was clearly seen scouring the corn field and produced the most concentrated damage. The narrow funnel crossed Browning Rd and hit a well constructed house. The only major part of the house that survived was an interior bathroom and hallway. Winds were estimated at 135 mph, and areas outside the narrow funnel had damage of 100 mph, and the entire overall width was 250 yards wide. The survey team found extensive tree damage along Van Meter Rd and Fuqua Rd and aerial photography confirmed the tornado was continuous in this rugged, mainly forested area. The tornado did minor roof damage to some homes along Blue Level Road with winds of 86 to 90 mph but did more substantial roof and side damage to several barns with winds of 90 to 95 mph. Based on drone technology, there appeared to be two distinct areas of damage, and likely had a smaller satellite tornado. There was extensive roof damage to the Zomi Agape fellowship center with insulation thrown both downwind and on the upwind side of the building. The tornado increased in speed when it was over Old Tramm Rd by Rembrandt Court and Powell Road. One house on Rembrandt Court was knocked off its foundation by the garage attachment and slid about 15 feet. Other homes were knocked down to just interior bathrooms and hallways remaining, but there were some foundation construction concerns. EF2 winds of 130 to 135 mph were evidenced in this area. Several houses were knocked down to the foundation, but there were foundation construction concerns. In addition, farm equipment from a barn on the right side of Powell St was thrown directly into homes on the left side of Powell Rd. The survey team found significant house damage to dozens of homes in the Creekwood subdivision. This included exterior collapsed walls, roofs blown off, foundations severely compromised, garages blown in, insulation blown on all four sides of houses, and garages severely damaged or destroyed. In fact, they were dozens of double garages damaged, where one garage door blew in and the other garage door blew out. There were hundreds of powerlines and snapped power poles down throughout the county. Trees were uprooted snapped and twisted facing in all directions. Dozens of cars were flipped, twisted, turned, and thrown into homes. 2 x 4s were thrown into the ground, like missiles. Several splintered boards were impaled into vehicle windshields, tires, and along the hood grills. Most of the damage was rated EF2 from 115 to 135 mph except for 8 homes near Mossy Creek. The survey team brought in engineers from WKU to look at 8 homes, which were wiped down to the foundation from Moss Creek to Mossy Stone. Engineers helped in determining winds speeds were 160 mph for these houses, a high EF3 rating. Tragically, several fatalities occurred in the subdivision area. The tornado was 250 yards wide in Creekwood, but increased to about 350 yards wide before crossing Veterans Parkway. The tornado crossed the William Natcher Parkway and hit large townhouses along Veterans Parkway. There were numerous windows shattered and some roof damage. One of the town houses was shifted off the foundation, but there were no bricks or other support on it. The tornado crossed Russellville Rd hitting many businesses. At Royal Motor Cars, several storage buildings were destroyed, major loss of roof panels at Cabreras Mexican restaurant and an auto parts store. At Plumbers Supply company at 2321 Russellville Rd. The garage was blown in and collapsed. The main building had a shifted foundation, and a partial collapse of some exterior cinderblock walls, tractors and trailers were twisted and flipped, and there was numerous power poles snapped. The Shell gas station had major damage to service station canopy and store, as well as walls of an Enterprise car rental. The tornado increased to quarter mile wide and went from EF2 of 130 mph, from Royal Motorcars to AutoZone, and then decreased to EF2, 115-120 mph and narrowed to 1/8th of a mile with major tree and roof damage along Lealand Street, Cedar Ridge, and University Drive. A fully loaded dumpster was thrown 250 yards. At Russell Road and Springhill Avenue, a Marathon gas station had its pumps destroyed, and most of the exterior walls were destroyed. The tornado missed Western Kentucky University by 225 yards, but debris was thrown all over the campus including some impaled debris into buildings. The tornado went along 31W including doing significant damage to roof at Bobas lounge, a liquor store, and a smoke shop. This was estimated to be 110 to 120 mph winds, and tornado width decreased to 250 yards by Walgreens and Taco Bell. The tornado, appeared to be slightly elevated, doing mainly tree damage, power poles, and house roofing and siding along Magnolia Ave and Nutwood St. It crossed Lehman, went along Covington, with wind speeds mainly of 95 to 110 mph. The owner of 708 Nutwood said, your warning saved our lives, as our house was violently shaking, but we sought shelter and lived. Much of the tree damage was facing from the northeast to the northwest. The tornado paralleled Cemetery Rd doing roof and gutter damage along with power lines and tree damage. The tornadoes speed and winds increased along Cherokee Dr. with roofs removed and large healthy hardwood trees uprooted. The width increased to 300 yards and speeds to 105 mph with width of 225 yards. The narrow 175 yard funnel, hit the Indian Hills golf course, twisting, snapping, and topping numerous pines and cedars with winds speeds of 86 to 90 mph. The tornado then crossed the Barren River and increased in speed along Old Porter Pike to EF2, between 111 and 120 mph. Huge diameter hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted, including several very tall oak trees. There was also extensive roof damage to some well built homes. It weakened as it approached exit 28, doing EF1 damage of 90-95 mph to Hucks gas station and damaged a very tall Wendys sign. On the north side of 31 W, a fully loaded 18 wheeler facing west, was knocked over and was dragged 15 yards to a northwesterly directly. Winds were increased to EF2, of 115 mph. At the Corvette plant there was significant roof damage, with metal sheeting, insulation, HVAC units, and other debris thrown hundreds of yards downwind. Light poles in the parking lot were snapped, One of the security checkpoints at the Corvette plant was totally destroyed with large sections of the building being thrown several hundred yards, and weighing over 100 pounds, striking several vehicles. Winds were mainly in the 110 to 120 mph range. The tornado continued to parallel I 65, just west of the interstate. It struck several homes at Bristow Rd and Friendship Rd. Most of the damage was done to roofs siding and gutters and destroyed a well- built greenhouse. Numerous power poles and lines were down and the debris pattern was facing from southeasterly, all the way to northwesterly. There was some barn and tree damage near Kelly Road and the CSX railroad crossing. Winds were 85 to 90 mph and width of 200 yards. The tornado really increased across the TransPark at Exit 30. A few metal building structures at the peak intensity of the tornado sustained heavy damage. The middle building totally collapsed. Analysis showed that building was well constructed, but the shearing force from the intense tornado ripped the metal frame from the anchoring plates of the building. Analysis of the third building showed the tornado had weakened some at this point, down to EF2 levels. The WSR-8D radar showed a Tornadic Debris Signature downstream of this area, which was lofted to around 18 kft, right at the high end of EF3 of 165 mph. The tornado weakened further downstream as it caused roofing and siding damage to several structures and tree damage into southeast Edmonson County. Civil Air Patrol imagery helped identify the end point of this tornado.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong upper-level trough over the western Plains induced a deepening surface low that tracked northeast across the Iowa/Illinois border. A very strong and deep southwest wind flow brought moist and unstable air into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Record high temperatures were recorded, including a high of 73 at Paducah. The combination of very strong winds aloft, unseasonably warm conditions, and a strong low pressure system were ideal for this tornado outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This long-track EF-3 tornado began in western Tennessee near Dyersburg (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western). It crossed from Stewart County, Tennessee into Christian County in the secured area of the Fort Campbell military reservation (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Central for the Stewart County portion of the track). The tornado passed only about half a mile southeast of the community of La Fayette on its way northeast across Interstate 24 and Fort Campbell Boulevard (U.S. Highway 41). Between La Fayette and I-24, several homes were destroyed (DI 2, DOD 6). The homes suffered complete destruction of the roof and/or attic. The walls were often damaged but remained standing. One house was moved from its foundation (DI 2, DOD 5). The occupants of the houses took shelter and generally escaped serious injury. A mobile home was destroyed (DI 3, DOD 9). A church sustained steeple damage. Significant damage occurred to the silos and irrigation system of a farm, where damage was estimated near 1 million dollars. A mile's worth of power poles were snapped on Fort Campbell Boulevard (U.S. 41) just one to two miles north of the I-24 interchange (DI 24, DOD 4). After crossing U.S. 41, the tornado struck Pembroke, where more significant structural damage occurred. A single-wide mobile home was destroyed (DI 3, DOD 9). The mobile home was not tied down. One person was injured at this site. At least one other mobile home was destroyed. Two barns were destroyed (DI 1, DOD 8). Roofs were completely removed from two houses. Elsewhere along the path east of Fort Campbell Boulevard, farm outbuildings and farm equipment were damaged or destroyed. The tornado was rated EF-2 in Christian County. Several damage sites were assigned a wind speed estimate of 125 mph, the highest in the county. The average path width in Christian County was about a mile, though it narrowed to about three-quarters of a mile toward the end of its life after crossing Highway 41. The tornado continued northeast of Pembroke before entering Todd County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It continued to uproot or snap numerous trees and continued to cause roof damage to residences. Pockets of EF2 damage were found in neighborhoods south of Heardmont Park and near Oak Mountain Elementary and Intermediate Schools, with significant damage to residences from falling trees and partial roof loss. Significant timber damage with some damage to structures was also noted near the lakes at the north gate to Oak Mountain State Park.

Along Belcher Road, anchoring to a metal building used for farm equipment failed, sending the structure crashing into an adjacent house. Across the field, a site built home had sections of roof removed and its open face garage blown away, with an adjacent farm building collapsed.

There were three primary areas of concentrated structural damage in Bibb County. Along Belcher Road, anchoring to a metal building used for farm equipment failed, sending the structure crashing into an adjacent house. Across the field, a site built home had sections of roof removed and its open face garage blown away, with an adjacent farm building collapsed. In Centreville city limits, snapped trees were prevalent near the Cahaba River. Along Montgomery Road east of town, heavy damage occurred where trees were debarked. Mobile homes were crushed by fallen trees and site built homes had roof damage. In the town of Ashby, along Buzzard Road, several mobile homes were destroyed. Anchoring was not apparent, though at least one of the mobile homes was thrown a fair distance. Site built homes on the same street suffered light to heavy roof damage but were still standing. The tornado crossed into northwest Chilton County just south of County Road 108.

A highly-sheared environment combined with increasing instability produced numerous tornadic thunderstorms. Severe parameters were supportive of significant and long-track supercells, prompting the issuance of a rare High Risk Convective Outlook from the Storm Prediction Center for portions of Central Alabama.||A total of 10 tornado tracks were surveyed in Central Alabama. This included 4 EF3 tornadoes, 3 EF2 tornadoes, and 3 EF1 tornadoes. Damage was significant along the paths of the most intense tornadoes and, unfortunately, injuries and fatalities occurred. |Some storms were cyclic, meaning multiple tornadoes were produced by the same storm. The most impressive tornado of the event was the long-track tornado that traveled nearly 80 miles from Hale County to Shelby County. This ranked as the seventh longest single tornado track in the state of Alabama.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in southeast Shelby County and determined that it was consistent with an EF1 tornado, with maximum winds near 110 mph. A strong, long-track tornado traveled across Hale, Perry, Bibb, Chilton, and Shelby Counties during the afternoon of March 25, 2021. It is estimated that the tornado had a 98 minute life span, with a path length of 80 miles.||The tornado crossed into Shelby County from Bibb County near the intersection of County Road 201 and 128. The tornado moved into the city of Calera, uprooting trees and blowing over an unanchored mobile home along County Road 67. The tornado then crossed Interstate 65 and moved into a large neighborhood along and northeast of Timberline Drive. The majority of structural damage was confined to loss of shingle and siding. However, at least 3 homes had portions of their roofs removed, 2 of them with significant loss. Next, mostly rural areas were hit between the cities of Columbiana and Calera, south of Highway 70. The last area of notable damage was in Columbiana. Numerous trees were uprooted from Mooney Road to Mardis Ferry Road and numerous homes were heavily damaged by fallen trees. Several mobile homes were impacted near the intersection of Alston Farm Road and Mardis Ferry Road. Most sustained roofing damage or were crushed by fallen trees. One unanchored mobile home was destroyed with 2 injuries that required hospitalization. Other structures were damaged along the path as well. The tornado then quickly weakened, and dissipated as it approached Highway 25 after crossing County Road 7.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A highly-sheared environment combined with increasing instability produced numerous tornadic thunderstorms. Severe parameters were supportive of significant and long-track supercells, prompting the issuance of a rare High Risk Convective Outlook from the Storm Prediction Center for portions of Central Alabama.||A total of 10 tornado tracks were surveyed in Central Alabama. This included 4 EF3 tornadoes, 3 EF2 tornadoes, and 3 EF1 tornadoes. Damage was significant along the paths of the most intense tornadoes and, unfortunately, injuries and fatalities occurred. |Some storms were cyclic, meaning multiple tornadoes were produced by the same storm. The most impressive tornado of the event was the long-track tornado that traveled nearly 80 miles from Hale County to Shelby County. This ranked as the seventh longest single tornado track in the state of Alabama.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in southeast Shelby County and determined that it was consistent with an EF1 tornado, with maximum winds near 110 mph. A strong, long-track tornado traveled across Hale, Perry, Bibb, Chilton, and Shelby Counties during the afternoon of March 25, 2021. It is estimated that the tornado had a 98 minute life span, with a path length of 80 miles.||The tornado crossed into Shelby County from Bibb County near the intersection of County Road 201 and 128. The tornado moved into the city of Calera, uprooting trees and blowing over an unanchored mobile home along County Road 67. The tornado then crossed Interstate 65 and moved into a large neighborhood along and northeast of Timberline Drive. The majority of structural damage was confined to loss of shingle and siding. However, at least 3 homes had portions of their roofs removed, 2 of them with significant loss. Next, mostly rural areas were hit between the cities of Columbiana and Calera, south of Highway 70. The last area of notable damage was in Columbiana. Numerous trees were uprooted from Mooney Road to Mardis Ferry Road and numerous homes were heavily damaged by fallen trees. Several mobile homes were impacted near the intersection of Alston Farm Road and Mardis Ferry Road. Most sustained roofing damage or were crushed by fallen trees. One unanchored mobile home was destroyed with 2 injuries that required hospitalization. Other structures were damaged along the path as well. The tornado then quickly weakened, and dissipated as it approached Highway 25 after crossing County Road 7.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The worst damage was observed slightly farther |northeast in the area of Stuart Creek in Upper Dublin. A number of|homes suffered partial to near total loss of roofing with many |damaged to the point of being uninhabitable. At least one home |experienced partial collapse of exterior walls consistent with EF2|tornado damage.

This mainly consisted of numerous snapped and uprooted |trees with minor to moderate roofing and siding damage to a number|of homes. The worst damage was observed slightly farther |northeast in the area of Stuart Creek in Upper Dublin. A number of|homes suffered partial to near total loss of roofing with many |damaged to the point of being uninhabitable. At least one home |experienced partial collapse of exterior walls consistent with EF2|tornado damage. Nearly all trees were snapped or heavily damaged |in this area as well. ||Damage continued along Route 309 to the area of Upper Dublin High|School. The high school itself suffered roofing damage, and |significant roofing loss occurred to an Upper Dublin Township |building adjacent to the high school. A number of residences along|Loch Alsh Ave and several surrounding streets were also damaged. |A woman was killed when a tree fell on her home on Kenyon Dr, the |only known tornado-related fatality from this tornado or any |tornado during this regional outbreak.||Further northeast, damage occurred on and around the Temple |University Ambler Campus, again consisting of considerable tree |damage and partial roofing loss on a number of homes and |university buildings. The tornado then moved into Maple Glen, |crossing a heavily developed area near Norristown Rd at Limekiln |Pike. Snapped trees and mostly minor roofing and siding damage to |several commercial buildings was observed in this area. The |tornado remained continuous but did begin to lose some intensity |as it moved into Horsham Twp, traveling east of Limekiln Pike. A |number of trees were snapped along Babylon Rd. Near Horsham Rd, |roofing damage occurred to a veterinary hospital, along with |additional large trees snapped. Damage appeared to end not long |after that point. The tornado crossed Horsham Rd, but little to no|damage was observed in a couple of parks across the road, |approaching the Bucks County line. The tornado is believed to have|lifted in that area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Temperatures broke several long-standing records. Memphis hit 80��F which broke a 103-year-old high-temperature record. ||A strong upper-level trough was approaching from the west, providing strong lift within the unseasonably warm and unstable air mass.

The tornado then tracked across the Mississippi River into northwest Tennessee, producing an additional 4 fatalities near Reelfoot Lake. This tornado lifted for a brief time in Obion County, reorganized, and then moved into Kentucky. All told, the mesocyclone tracked for over 300 miles and was producing tornadoes for over 250 miles. This storm was responsible for at least 9 fatalities and many injuries in the NWS Memphis CWA along with millions of dollars of damage. ||As the initial supercell was crossing the state line into Kentucky, a string of supercells was moving into eastern Arkansas. A few brief tornadoes produced minor damage near Cash in western Craighead County and in the Fisher area of western Poinsett County. As the dominant supercell moved into eastern Poinsett County, the mesocyclone quickly intensified and the storm produced an EF-2 tornado in Trumann with several injuries and widespread damage. ||A new supercell developed in Mississippi County causing straight-line wind damage initially. This supercell intensified as it crossed the Mississippi River and produced another long-track tornado starting in Dyer County,  Tennessee.

This tornado was rated EF-3 and resulted in several injuries with Kenton and Dresden, Tennessee being the hardest hit. ||The convection eventually evolved into a QLCS as it moved east. A mesovortex developed south of I-40 near Jackson that resulted in 3 tornadoes across eastern Madison, Henderson, and Decatur Counties including an EF-2. Non-tornadic storms moved across the Memphis metropolitan area, producing straight-line wind damage as a mesovortex moved through the city.

This storm was responsible for at least 9 fatalities and many injuries in the NWS Memphis CWA along with millions of dollars of damage. ||As the initial supercell was crossing the state line into Kentucky, a string of supercells was moving into eastern Arkansas. A few brief tornadoes produced minor damage near Cash in western Craighead County and in the Fisher area of western Poinsett County. As the dominant supercell moved into eastern Poinsett County, the mesocyclone quickly intensified and the storm produced an EF-2 tornado in Trumann with several injuries and widespread damage. ||A new supercell developed in Mississippi County causing straight-line wind damage initially. This supercell intensified as it crossed the Mississippi River and produced another long-track tornado starting in Dyer County,  Tennessee. This tornado tracked east-northeast across northwest Tennessee into Henry County, and eventually into Kentucky. This tornado was rated EF-3 and resulted in several injuries with Kenton and Dresden, Tennessee being the hardest hit. ||The convection eventually evolved into a QLCS as it moved east.

Non-tornadic storms moved across the Memphis metropolitan area, producing straight-line wind damage as a mesovortex moved through the city. A fatality was reported in Shelby County after a large tree fell on a home in South Memphis.

Temperatures broke several long-standing records. Memphis hit 80��F which broke a 103-year-old high-temperature record. ||A strong upper-level trough was approaching from the west, providing strong lift within the unseasonably warm and unstable air mass.  MLCAPE reached the 1500-2000 J/kg range by 6 PM. The wind field was impressive with plenty of vertical wind shear needed for organized thunderstorms. Effective 0-1 km storm-relative helicity values ranged from 300-400 m2/s2 with effective bulk shear values of 70 knots - more than sufficient to support discrete supercells in the warm sector ahead of the cold front.||The first supercell developed in central Arkansas and tracked into northeast Arkansas producing a few weak tornadoes initially before intensifying across eastern Craighead and Mississippi Counties and killing two people. The tornado eventually strengthened into an EF-4 while moving through the Missouri Bootheel, resulting in 2 direct and one indirect fatality in Pemiscot County. The tornado then tracked across the Mississippi River into northwest Tennessee, producing an additional 4 fatalities near Reelfoot Lake. This tornado lifted for a brief time in Obion County, reorganized, and then moved into Kentucky. All told, the mesocyclone tracked for over 300 miles and was producing tornadoes for over 250 miles. This storm was responsible for at least 9 fatalities and many injuries in the NWS Memphis CWA along with millions of dollars of damage. ||As the initial supercell was crossing the state line into Kentucky, a string of supercells was moving into eastern Arkansas. A few brief tornadoes produced minor damage near Cash in western Craighead County and in the Fisher area of western Poinsett County. As the dominant supercell moved into eastern Poinsett County, the mesocyclone quickly intensified and the storm produced an EF-2 tornado in Trumann with several injuries and widespread damage. ||A new supercell developed in Mississippi County causing straight-line wind damage initially. This supercell intensified as it crossed the Mississippi River and produced another long-track tornado starting in Dyer County,  Tennessee. This tornado tracked east-northeast across northwest Tennessee into Henry County, and eventually into Kentucky. This tornado was rated EF-3 and resulted in several injuries with Kenton and Dresden, Tennessee being the hardest hit. ||The convection eventually evolved into a QLCS as it moved east. A mesovortex developed south of I-40 near Jackson that resulted in 3 tornadoes across eastern Madison, Henderson, and Decatur Counties including an EF-2. Non-tornadic storms moved across the Memphis metropolitan area, producing straight-line wind damage as a mesovortex moved through the city. A fatality was reported in Shelby County after a large tree fell on a home in South Memphis. Later that night, an EF-1 tornado occurred in Prentiss County before the severe weather threat began to wind down around 6 AM on December 11, 2021. ||In total, there were 18 tornadoes across the NWS Memphis CWA.  Along with tornadoes, several incidents of wind damage and minor flash flooding also occurred.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> After crossing from Craighead County into Mississippi County the tornado struck the northern portions of Leachville, in northwestern Mississippi County. Several homes suffered partial or complete roof loss in northwestern Leachville. A restaurant, store, and cotton gin suffered considerable damage along Highway 77, and numerous power poles were snapped. A fatality occurred in the store.

The MCS produced widespread strong winds with localized damaging winds from individual microbursts across the region. The strong winds also generated dense blowing dust in southwest Arizona. In addition to the wind, storms were producing average rain rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour with briefly higher rates in the strongest cells. This led to flash flooding in multiple areas. The town of Gila Bend suffered catastrophic flash flooding after 2 to 4 inches of rain fell over a large portion of the basin containing Sand Tank and Bender Washes, which flow into Gila Bend. A breach of the canal in town due to erosion added to the flash flooding. Significant flow through the washes impacted numerous homes and businesses and there were 2 fatalities. A state of emergency was declared for this event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Following 2 to 4 inches of rain in 1 to 2 hours over the Sand Tank Wash watershed, catastrophic flooding occurred in the small town of Gila Bend with feet of water, mud, and debris moving through town. Storm surveys were completed by NWS Phoenix, Maricopa County Department of Emergency Management (MCDEM), American Red Cross, and Flood Control District of Maricopa County (FCDMC). FCDMC gages on Sand Tank Wash, Bender Wash, and in the Maricopa Mountains measured rainfall amounts around 3 to 4 inches in 1 to 2 hours for an annual exceedance probability of 0.1%. FCDMC found the most significant floodwaters were within Sand Tank Wash, with lesser flows in Bender and Scott Avenue Washes. The NWS Phoenix survey found evidence of out of bank flooding in Sand Tank Wash 1 to 3 miles south of Interstate-8 (I-8) with 2 to 6 feet of water and sizable debris. The streamflow gage on Sand Tank Wash at I-8 reached alarm stage at 0157MST, bank full at 0341MST, and flood stage at 0352MST. The gage crested at 7.69 feet with 5000 cfs of flow at 0408MST. The floodwaters and debris that moved through town caused flood damage to at least 140 homes and 25 businesses. Most structures impacted were between the Gila Bend Canal and Main Street and then along Pima Street. During the flooding, Maricopa County Sheriff's Office rescued at least 30 individuals from their roofs along with others pulled from stranded vehicles. Photos after the water receded showed the canal was eroded and breached where Sand Tank Wash flows over it. Photos also showed 2 to 5 foot water lines both on the outside and inside of many of the structures, piles of debris, damaged property and vehicles, and erosion. Of the homes MCDEM assessed, 21 were deemed uninhabitable after the flooding. Unfortunately there were 2 direct fatalities with this event. One made a heroic effort to save a stranded motorist before they themselves were swept away in their own vehicle. The other was swept away in one of the flooded washes. Additionally, many farm animals were killed. Besides the fatalities, no other injuries were reported. A state of emergency was declared for this event.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A warm front moved northward into Middle Tennessee early on March 27 before stalling near the I-40 corridor. Between 300-400 AM CDT, numerous showers and thunderstorms developed along the warm front, many of which became severe and produced large hail up to half dollar size along with frequent lightning and heavy rainfall. Showers and storms continued off and on the rest of the day across Middle Tennessee, particularly near the stalled warm front. In fact, another round of severe thunderstorms including supercells developed during the afternoon and evening hours near and south of the warm front. These storms dropped large hail up to tennis ball size and caused a few reports of wind damage, but the main impact was additional heavy rainfall which began causing flash flooding south of Nashville. Flooding only worsened as showers and storms redeveloped over the same areas through the evening, with numerous Flash Flood Warnings issued and several reports of flooded roads and water rescues.||After midnight, even more heavy rainfall falling along the already waterlogged I-40 corridor prompted a rare Flash Flood Emergency for the southern and eastern Nashville metro area, including southeastern Davidson County, western Wilson County, and northern Williamson County. These areas received between 7 to 9 of rain, causing rapid rises on several Nashville metro creeks and streams, including Sevenmile Creek (which reached its highest level on record), Browns Creek, and Mill Creek, among others. Many of these creeks reached within their 2nd or 3rd highest water levels on record. The rapid water rises flooded hundreds of homes and businesses, with reports of some people trapped in the attics or on the roofs of their houses. Dozens of roadways were flooded and impassable, including both I-24 and I-40, with many cars submerged in the flood waters and people forced to cling onto trees to avoid getting swept away. Although the flood waters receded quickly on Sunday, March 28, many area rivers reached flood stage in the week after the event, including the Cumberland River, Harpeth River, and Duck River.||A total of 7 deaths were reported from the flooding across Middle Tennessee, with 5 in Davidson County, 1 in Cheatham County, and 1 in Maury County. Emergency management reports indicate over 500 homes and businesses were flooded, and a Presidential Disaster Proclamation was declared for many counties in May 2021. This flash flood event was the worst seen in Middle Tennessee since the May 1-2, 2010 flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Significant flash flooding affected far northern Maury County. A woman attempting to clear debris blocking a drainage culvert on her property at 6415 Leipers Creek Road was swept through the culvert and drowned. Several roads were flooded and closed, including Fairview Road at Les Robinson Road west of Spring Hill, and Duplex Road between Highway 31 and Miles Johnson Parkway in Spring Hill. Flood waters also reportedly covered the parking lot of Walmart in Spring Hill on Highway 31.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 334.90K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorm activity formed by the late morning hours and intensified as the day progressed. Several reports of large hail was received across central and eastern New Mexico, and a few tornadoes and landspouts were observed across the plains. The anomalously moist air mass allowed for heavy rain to fall as well, especially across south central and southeast New Mexico which received rainfall totals of three to five inches in a very short period of time. This led to flash flooding in Lincoln and Chaves counties in which several water rescues had to be performed.

One individual was in their truck at Alamo Canyon Road and became stuck in the low water crossing when the flood waters inundated it. The individual then either tried to escape or the flood waters pulled them out of their truck. Tragically, they drowned, and their body was found the next day.

A warm front moved northward into Middle Tennessee early on March 27 before stalling near the I-40 corridor. Between 300-400 AM CDT, numerous showers and thunderstorms developed along the warm front, many of which became severe and produced large hail up to half dollar size along with frequent lightning and heavy rainfall. Showers and storms continued off and on the rest of the day across Middle Tennessee, particularly near the stalled warm front. In fact, another round of severe thunderstorms including supercells developed during the afternoon and evening hours near and south of the warm front. These storms dropped large hail up to tennis ball size and caused a few reports of wind damage, but the main impact was additional heavy rainfall which began causing flash flooding south of Nashville. Flooding only worsened as showers and storms redeveloped over the same areas through the evening, with numerous Flash Flood Warnings issued and several reports of flooded roads and water rescues.||After midnight, even more heavy rainfall falling along the already waterlogged I-40 corridor prompted a rare Flash Flood Emergency for the southern and eastern Nashville metro area, including southeastern Davidson County, western Wilson County, and northern Williamson County. These areas received between 7 to 9 of rain, causing rapid rises on several Nashville metro creeks and streams, including Sevenmile Creek (which reached its highest level on record), Browns Creek, and Mill Creek, among others. Many of these creeks reached within their 2nd or 3rd highest water levels on record. The rapid water rises flooded hundreds of homes and businesses, with reports of some people trapped in the attics or on the roofs of their houses. Dozens of roadways were flooded and impassable, including both I-24 and I-40, with many cars submerged in the flood waters and people forced to cling onto trees to avoid getting swept away. Although the flood waters receded quickly on Sunday, March 28, many area rivers reached flood stage in the week after the event, including the Cumberland River, Harpeth River, and Duck River.||A total of 7 deaths were reported from the flooding across Middle Tennessee, with 5 in Davidson County, 1 in Cheatham County, and 1 in Maury County. Emergency management reports indicate over 500 homes and businesses were flooded, and a Presidential Disaster Proclamation was declared for many counties in May 2021. This flash flood event was the worst seen in Middle Tennessee since the May 1-2, 2010 flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Major and historic flash flooding affected southern and eastern Davidson County, with the worst flooding affecting areas along and near Sevenmile Creek and Mill Creek in south Nashville. Hundreds of homes and businesses were flooded, numerous roadways were flooded and closed including I-24, I-40, and I-440, and over 130 water rescues were conducted from people stranded in flooded vehicles and homes. Homes and businesses that were flooded included a hotel at 95 Wallace Road near I-24 at Harding Place, the South Brooke Apartments on Linbar Drive, many homes around Edmondson Pike at Blackman Road, the Walmart on Nolensville Pike at Harding Place with vehicles in the parking lot submerged up to their windows, a home on Truxton Court in Donelson, and the Kroger on Old Hickory Blvd in Hermitage which also had cars stalled in flood waters in the parking lot. Residents were trapped and rescued from the second stories of homes on Paragon Mills Road, and the attics of homes on Currey Road and also on Suter Drive near Edmondson Pike. Other people were rescued clinging to trees or in flood waters in the 400 block of Hogan Road, on Milner Drive, and in the 400 block of Harding Place. Interstate 24 near Antioch Pike was submerged with many vehicles stranded and around one dozen drivers rescued, and Interstate 40 and Interstate 440 were also flooded in a few areas. Other roads that were flooded and impassable included Rosa Parks Blvd near the Farmers Market, Highway 70 near White Bridge Road, Dodson Chapel Road, Tulip Grove Road, and Chandler Road. A total of 5 people were killed, 3 of which were swept away from a homeless camp along Sevenmile Creek near Edmondson Pike at Nolensville Pike. Another man drowned when he left his submerged vehicle and was swept away near the Nashboro Village Golf Course at Nashboro Blvd at Flintlock Court, and another man drowned in his vehicle behind the Walmart near Harding Place at Nolensville Pike.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Ida made landfall across southeast Louisiana during the late morning on August 29th. Ida turned north and northeast across central Mississippi during late afternoon and evening on Monday, August 30th.||The core of the hurricane force winds was relatively small, only extending out from the center about 50 miles. However tropical storm force winds extended outward over 150 miles from the center. This brought tropical storm force wind gusts to southeast Mississippi and much of southwest Alabama, with a brief period of sustained tropical storm force winds to coastal Alabama. Wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph were recorded across southeast Mississippi and southwestern Alabama. The tropical storm force winds also downed several trees across the area.||The highest storm surge inundation values observed were between 3 to 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. Storm surge surveys indicated the highest water levels were in the Bayou La Batre area along and near Shell Belt Road where peak water levels were in the 4 to 4.5 feet MHHW range.||The slow movement of the storm caused widespread flooding especially across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. Rainfall amounts of anywhere from 7 to 12 inches were recorded across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. This led to significant flash flooding along with significant river flooding.||Two tornadoes during the afternoon on August 30th. An EF-1 in northern Mobile County and an EF-1 in southern Clarke County.||Here is a breakdown of county impacts:||Stone County MS: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed several trees in Stone|County. Seven to ten inches of rain was recorded and one road had to be barricaded due to flooding. The low lying red creek and mill creek areas experienced flooding, impacting two RV parks.||George County MS: Eight to twelve inches of rain fell across George county which|resulted in significant flash flooding. A portion of Highway 26 collapsed just west of Lucedale, killing three people and injuring seven others. Eleven other roads were significantly flooded and had some form of washout or damage.||Mobile County AL: The west end of Dauphin Island was significantly impacted by Ida|from a combination of high surf, storm surge, and tropical storm force winds. Three miles of Bienville boulevard was impassable due to surge flooding and sand up to four feet deep. The high surf also produced minor damage to a few homes on the west end. Power poles were also knocked down on the island. Storm surge inundation peaked|between 3 and 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. The highest tidal gauge readings were 3.78 feet MHHW at Coast Guard sector Mobile and 3.82 feet MHHW at the Bayou La Batre bridge. Storm surge surveys along Shell Belt road in Bayou La Batre indicated water lines that reached between 4-4.5 feet.||This surge flooding resulted in closures of low lying coastal roads, such as Shell Belt road, the US Highway 90 causeway, the foot of the Dog river bridge, and the Dauphin Island causeway. Coastal flooding persisted across three high tide cycles which resulted in prolonged closures. Observations at Dauphin Island and Buccaneer Yacht Club on|Mobile Bay measured brief sustained periods of tropical storm force winds between 40-45 mph. Gusts of 50 to 60 mph were recorded in heavier rain bands across central and southern Mobile county. An EF-1 tornado impacted parts of Saraland, Satsuma, and Creola early in the afternoon on August 30th, resulting in three injuries. Rainfall|totals of 8 to 11 inches were recorded across the county, especially in southern and central portions. This heavy rainfall led to some urban flooding in neighborhoods and damaged some drainage culverts.||Baldwin County AL: Storm surge inundation of 3 to 4 feet above normally dry ground was recorded from Weeks Bay northward. This resulted in flooding of low lying areas and closure of the US Highway 90 Causeway. Five to nine inches of rain was measured across Baldwin county, which resulted in areas of flash flooding. A portion of River Road along Styx River was washed out due to heavy rainfall and flooding. A few drainage culverts were also significant damaged in the county. Tropical storm conditions were confined primarily to immediate coastal areas, particularly along the Fort Morgan peninsula.||Clarke County AL: An EF-1 Tornado impacted portions of southern Clarke County, significantly damaging a couple of structures.||Escambia County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand on coastal roadways along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for an extended period of time.||Santa Rosa County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for and extended period of time.||Okaloosa County FL: Strong rip currents produced by Ida resulted in two rip current fatalities in the wake of the storm. One occurred on September 1st when a 14 year old teen drowned off a Destin Beach. The other fatality occurred on September 4th when a 58 year old man drowned off Henderson Beach State Park.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Very heavy rainfall with 2 inch per hour rain rates fell over very saturated conditions and resulted in additional flash flooding.

Occurring only a few months after another deadly and disastrous flash flood impacted the Nashville metro area on March 27-28, 2021 and killed 7 people, this flash flood left catastrophic damage across several counties in western Middle Tennessee, including parts of Dickson County, Hickman County, Houston County, and especially Humphreys County. The flood waters damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes, businesses, vehicles, and schools, with many buildings washed completely off their foundations. The damage was so severe that a Presidential Disaster Declaration was declared for Humphreys County two days later on August 23, 2021. Later in the week, Dickson, Hickman, and Houston Counties also received a Presidential Disaster Declaration. Very sadly, a total of 20 people were determined to have drowned in the flood, 19 of which were in the city of Waverly, TN, and 1 in the community of Hurricane Mills.||This historic flash flood occurred as a thunderstorms repeatedly developed along a weak surface front located over western Middle Tennessee during the morning hours of August 21.

A rain gauge at the McEwen Wastewater Treatment Plant measured a rainfall total of 20.73 inches from midnight to 7pm CDT, which was verified by NWS personnel and set a new Tennessee state record for 24-hour rainfall.

A fast-moving flood wave traveling westward down Trace Creek caused flood waters to rise several feet in roughly a 10 minute timespan between 1000am to 1010am CDT, flooding hundreds of homes, businesses, and churches, some of which were washed off their foundations. News reports and information from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency indicated a total of 523 homes were impacted by the flooding, with 272 totally destroyed, 168 with major damage, 31 with minor damage, and 20 affected. 44 businesses and 8 public facilities were also damaged, including the Waverly Elementary School and Waverly Junior High School which will have to be torn down are rebuilt in a different location. Dozens of cars were also washed away and deposited long distances downstream, and many of the roadway bridges than spanned Trace Creek were knocked off their pilings and heavily damaged. TEMA reported damage to roads and schools alone totaled $31,844,911, with an additional estimated $60-70 million in damage to homes and businesses. 19 people were killed in Waverly, along with 1 other who died in Hurricane Mills, making this the deadliest flash flood in Middle Tennessee history.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Tropical moisture and strong southeast upslope flow into the Blue Ridge mountains resulted in widespread showers and some thunderstorms producing extremely heavy rainfall rates. By the time the rain tapered off by the end of the 17th, 24-hour rainfall amounts of 5-12 inches were reported across portions of the mountains and foothills. This was in addition to a small area of 5-10 inch amounts that fell across portions of the southern North Carolina mountains during the morning of the 16th. The result of this rainfall was significant to catastrophic flash flooding across portions of the French Broad and Pigeon River basins, including some of the worst flooding to impact these areas in almost 20 years. The most severe flooding occurred in portions of southern and central Haywood County, where a number of fatalities and hundreds of millions of dollars and damage occurred. In addition, a brief tornado touched down in Iredell County and tracked into Alexander County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Emergency management and stream gauges reported catastrophic flash flooding developed within the Pigeon River watershed after 6 to 8 inches of rain fell in just a few hours across the northern slopes of the Balsams. This was on top of 5 to 10 inches that fell over the Shining Rock Wilderness during the morning of the 16th, resulting in 36-hour totals of more than a foot. Flash flooding initially developed along the West Fork and especially the East Fork of the Pigeon River. Water from the latter stream, swept downstream through the Cruso community causing widespread damage. Six people were killed in Cruso, four of them in a campground along the East Fork, where numerous recreational vehicles and automobiles were swept away. Water from the two forks of the river rushed downstream to the main channel of the Pigeon, causing major flooding along the stream in Canton and Clyde for the first time since Tropical Cyclone Ivan in September 2004. Numerous buildings in downtown Canton were inundated. In total, around 700 homes were impacted by flooding, with a couple of hundred of those destroyed. Numerous vehicles were also swept away or otherwise damaged and hundreds of people were rescued. Dozens of roads were flooded, with many roads and bridges damaged or destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Moderate to high instability and high moisture content supported scattered strong thunderstorms. With deep south to southwest upslope flow, storms favored the foothills and mountainous areas of Maricopa and Gila counties. Most storms were producing at least 1 to 2 inch per hour rain rates, with several storms producing 2 to 3 inch rates and at times higher. Back-building and training of storms over the same areas resulted in significant to catastrophic flash flooding. A few burn scars experienced flash flooding, including the recent Telegraph burn area which had catastrophic flooding of the Russell Gulch drainage. There were also 2 fatalities on this day with off-roaders recreating near Camp Creek in northeast Maricopa County. The strong to severe storms also produced damaging winds from microbursts and small hail over lower desert locations.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> According to local media reports, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office found two people had perished inside an ATV that was buried in mud and debris downstream in Camp Creek. MCSO was notified and began searching for the missing people around 1600MST on the 18th but did not recover the ATV until 0800MST on the 19th. Media reported that other recreationists were successfully rescued from the area, including a father and daughter who were trapped near Needle Rock Recreation Site and had to be rescued by helicopter. A Camp Creek rain gauge recorded 3.54 inches of rain between 1300MST and 1420MST. The Rackensack Canyon rain gauge measured 3.83 inches of rain between 1250MST and 1430MST. The Maricopa County Flood Control District also reported that Bartlett Dam Road was closed due to swiftly flowing water over the roadway from Camp Creek.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

On August 26th, the wave developed into a tropical depression, which organized further and became Tropical Storm Ida later that day, near Grand Cayman. On a northwestward track, Ida intensified into a hurricane on August 27, just before moving over western Cuba. A day later, the hurricane underwent rapid intensification over the Gulf of Mexico as it passed over a warm core eddy and reached major hurricane strength. It was just under 72 hours from tropical depression formation to category 4 strength with 150 mph winds. Ida remained at its peak intensity of 150 mph winds and a minimum central pressure of 929 millibars as it made landfall near Port Fourchon midday on August 29th. It didn���t weaken to a tropical storm until it reached near the Louisiana/Mississippi border. ||Ida produced extensive to catastrophic damage across southeast Louisiana. On Grand Isle, around 40% of the structures were destroyed and the island was uninhabitable. Near 75% of the structures in Lafourche Parish were damaged or destroyed and likely similar numbers in Terrebonne Parish. 100+ mph wind gusts reached as far inland as Interstate 12. These winds damaged more than 30,000 poles, over 36,000 spans of wire and nearly 6,000 transformers. Of those more than 30,000 Louisiana poles, nearly 80% of those broken or damaged are from the most heavily impacted areas.|In total, the number of damaged or destroyed poles from Ida is more than hurricanes Katrina, Ike, Delta and Zeta combined. Due to major destruction to the power grid across the region, over 1 million customers were without power after landfall. Some of those power outages near the Louisiana coast lasted for around 4 weeks. |||The Louisiana Department of Health reported 3 direct fatalities and 28 indirect fatalities. Excessive heat and carbon monoxide poisoning were the most common causes of death. Indirect injuries associated with Ida: 351 heat-related, 183 carbon monoxide exposure, and 3 electrocutions. Storm surge ranged from a few feet to 10 to 15 feet. Hurricane Ida caused approximately $30 billion worth of damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Significant street flooding occurred in a few parts of the parish, though no homes were reported to take on water.

After hearing a large thunderclap, the crew decided they needed to move down the mountain to a safer location. While hiking out, the crew passed through a metal fence gate when one firefighter saw a lightning strike very close by. He saw it split between a tree and the metal fence and immediately felt tingling and cramping in his feet and lower back. Another firefighter was in the process of latching the metal fence gate when he felt a jolt go through his harm and his arm tingling. There were no serious injuries between the three firefighters and all refused treatment, even though they were shivering badly and were experiencing the early stages of hypothermia from being exposed to the heavy rain and hail.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
