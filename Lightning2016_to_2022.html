Some clusters of thunderstorms developed in the early to mid afternoon hours across the Lake George-Saratoga Region, producing damage to trees and power lines.  In addition, one storm in the Lake George area contained a lightning strike, which injured multiple people huddled under a tree.||By the evening hours, a more organized line of thunderstorms moved from west to east across all of eastern Upstate New York.  This line produced widespread wind damage, with the most concentrated damage in the Pine Lake area of northwestern Fulton County. ||In addition to the gusty winds, the thunderstorms also produced a significant amount of cloud-to-ground lightning. Over 50,000 customers lost power at the height of the storms as a result of the gusty winds and lightning strikes.||Thunderstorms ended with the passage of the cold front during the overnight hours.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Fifteen people were injured at the Lake George Battlefield Park due to a lightning strike and needed to be hospitalized.

As the convective system evolved into Mississippi, numerous tornadoes developed along the advancing line, with the most prolific damage occurring along the track of a large meso-scale convective vortex (MCV). This feature tracked roughly from Claiborne County through western Hinds/Madison, eastern Yazoo, eastern Holmes, southeastern Carroll, Montgomery, and northwestern Webster counties.

To the east of the NJ Turnpike/Interstate 95, precipitation began as rain or a mix of rain and snow. Further west, precipitation fell mainly as snow. During the daylight hours of the 7th, precipitation to the east of the NJ Turnpike/Interstate 95 turned over to snow, as colder air worked in from the north and west. ||The snow fell heavy at times away from the coast.  Snowfall amounts near the Turnpike generally ranged from 6 to 12 inches, with a sharp decrease to the southeast. Further northwest, 12 to 24 inches was observed across large parts of Somerset, Hunterdon, Morris, and Sussex Counties.||The snow contained large amounts of liquid, making it heavy and wet. This resulted in downed trees, limbs, and wires, leading to numerous power outages across portions of New Jersey, especially where the heaviest snow was reported. Many customers were still without power from the previous storm when this storm struck. Governor Murphy estimated about 350,000 customers state-wide lost power as a result of this second storm.||There were numerous reports of lightning associated with the precipitation in New Jersey, mainly southeast of the Turnpike. This included thunderstorms with heavy rainfall closer to the coast, and thunder with heavy snowfall further inland. In Ocean County, a person was struck by lightning in Manchester Township, and a lightning strike led to a house fire in Ship Bottom.||Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency which went into effect at 8 PM Tuesday March 6th.||Flights were cancelled at all the major airports due to the storm, and Amtrak cancelled at least some Wednesday service.||An accident involving ten tractor-trailers closed all four lanes of the New Jersey bound span of the Delaware Memorial Bridge for over two hours on Wednesday, March 7th.  Large amounts of snow that accumulated in a short period of time was blamed for the crash. The trucks did not actually crash into each other, rather they got stuck in the snow as they were climbing the ramp on the east-bound bridge.||Minor flooding was reported along some portions of the New Jersey coast, particularly north of Atlantic City, but there were no major problems.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A broad area of low pressure extending from the Ohio Valley to the Piedmont of South Carolina consolidated off the Virginia Capes during the early morning of March 7th.

Multiple incidents of strong winds, flash flooding and flooding occurred with Florence. The following counties were included in a subsequent Presidential Disaster Declaration: Botetourt, Franklin, Halifax, City of Martinsville, Patrick, and Pittsylvania. Several more counties were still working through the validation process: Charlotte, Craig, and City of Danville. The first rainfall of any significance reached southern Virginia on the 15th  with about 1 to 3 inches falling by 12z (700 AM) on the 16th. Much heavier rainfall began to spread further northward during the afternoon and evening of the 16th prompting numerous Flash Flood Warnings and causing significant flood impacts.  The highest observed rain amounts in Virginia within the HSA were over parts of southwest Floyd and northwest Patrick counties with over 8 inches in 24 hours (ending at 700 AM on the 17th) and 9 to 10 inches storm total.

This made it the largest December tornado outbreak in the state of Illinois since 1957, and the third largest tornado outbreak across Illinois in any month since 1950.  Within the National Weather Service Lincoln County Warning Area (CWA), 20 tornadoes touched down...with the most significant being an EF-3 tornado that tore through the city of Taylorville in Christian County.  Despite several communities being directly impacted and experiencing major damage, there were no fatalities reported.  The severe weather was caused by a deep area of low pressure that tracked from eastern Kansas into north-central Illinois.  Warm air surging northward ahead of the low allowed temperatures to soar into the upper 50s and lower 60s, resulting in a narrow corridor of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values of 500-1000J/kg ahead of an approaching occluded front.  Thanks to ample low-level wind shear, numerous supercell thunderstorms developed within the instability axis by mid to late afternoon.  Many of the storms produced tornadoes over the next several hours before the storms gradually weakened by mid-evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A lightning strike injured a person in Huntsville in Schuyler County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An organized line of severe thunderstorms formed over the central Plains states during the night of the 20th. This bowing line of storms progressed southeast across the St. Louis area during the midday hours, then down across the lower Ohio Valley and southeast Missouri during the afternoon. Widespread wind damage was reported in parts of southern Illinois, especially in far southern areas from the Marion-Carbondale area southward to the Ohio River. Flash flooding was reported in a few locations. The atmosphere ahead of the storms became strongly unstable, with surface-based capes exceeding 4,000. Given the strong buoyancy, wind profiles were sufficiently strong for widespread severe weather. Deep-layer (0-6 km) wind shear values were no higher than about 30 knots, and 0-1 km shear was about 20 knots. Even though the region was under a broad 500 mb ridge, a moderately strong low-level feed of very moist and unstable air fueled the intense storms as they propagated southeastward.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 31-year-old man was struck by lightning while riding a lawn mower.

A fairly large shield of rain, with a few embedded thunderstorms, moved northeast across south central Nebraska from late morning through mid-afternoon. Behind this area of rain, numerous scattered, poorly-organized thunderstorms moved in from Kansas. Between 5 and 7 PM CST, mostly low-end severe hail occurred at various locations from near Alma northeastward to Aurora. The one exception was golf ball size hail that fell a few miles north of Hampton, in Hamilton county.||These storms were elevated as the area was on the cold side of the low pressure system that moved through on the 22nd. By the time these severe thunderstorms occurred, the low was exiting the Great Lakes. The cold front extended southwest, across Kansas, to another low pressure system over Colorado and New Mexico. High pressure was over Nebraska. The flow aloft was highly-amplified with southwest flow over the central Plains a longwave trough and upper low were over the Western U.S., and a ridge was over the East. Surface temperatures and dewpoints were in the 50s. Mid-level lapse rates were 6.5-7.0 C/km, and MUCAPE was between 500 and 1000 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was 60-70 kt.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Investigators with the Nebraska State Fire Marshal���s Office determined that lightning was the cause of a very large fire that completely destroyed the Cooperative Producers Inc. Dry Fertilizer Facility. This facility opened in July 2018, and was located just east of the intersection of Highway 6 and Showboat Road. Hastings Rural Fire District, along with firefighters from 4 other fire districts, helped contain the fire. The fire was contained by 3 AM CDT, but firefighters were on scene to address hotspots well into Friday. Two injuries were reported as a result of the fire, both injured parties were treated and released at a local hospital within hours of the fire. The injured parties were semi drivers on site at the time of the fire. Damage is estimated to be at least $5 million worth of product at the plant with a facility cost of $14 million.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 19.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The Canby, Minnesota airport measured a wind gust of 72 mph. These type of wind speeds continued across portions of Yellow Medicine and Lac Qui Parle counties where hundreds of trees and power lines were blown down. There was another wind gust of 68 mph at the Department of Transportation road sensor (Near Hanley Falls, MN) that went offline as the gust was recorded. ||The worst area occurred in the city of Granite Falls where winds tore open two roofs and allowed water to pour through ventilation ducts into classrooms and hallways, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage to the Yellow Medicine East School District building. The Granite Fun restaurant and golf course also sustained damage with 55 to 60 trees blown down. Due to the extensive damage, the city of Granite Falls declared a state of emergency. ||Although wind damage occurred east of Granite Falls, mainly between Sacred Heart to Renville, this storm weakened as it moved eastward toward the western part of the Twin Cities.||A secondary area of storms developed across south central Minnesota during the mid-late afternoon near New Ulm, and produced another area of significant wind damage eastward toward Cannon Falls, and Red Wing. There was a swath of tree damage around Cannon Falls where one house lost its roof, with other having minor roof damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A lightning bolt struck a park shelter where 40 people were attending a birthday party.

Another firefighter was in the process of latching the metal fence gate when he felt a jolt go through his harm and his arm tingling.
