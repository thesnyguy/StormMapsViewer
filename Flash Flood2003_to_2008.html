In addition to these tornadoes, a major flood developed over Harris and surrounding counties during the middle of this tornadic outbreak. Over 300 homes, along with hundreds of vehicles, were flooded.These tornadic storms developed over parts of Wharton and Matagorda counties shortly after sunrise with the first confirmed tornado occurring just east of El Campo around 9:00 am. Strong 500mb upper level troughing over the western U.S. moved from west to east across the Southern Plains. The polar jet stream associated with this 500 millibar trough surged into west Texas and then curved sharply northeastward into the Central Plains. The sub-tropical jet stream was oriented west to east across deep southern Texas. This jet stream pattern was the impetus to strong lower level convergence due to the enhanced upper level divergence. Low level moisture had substantially increased and was about 200 percent of normal by 6 AM. Vertical wind profiles also showed a great deal of low level wind shear with the greatest shear occurring in the lowest 2000 feet. In addition, these veering wind speeds rapidly increased with height. A focus for the thunderstorm development was provided by a weak low level boundary which was aligned southwest to northeast, or generally along the U.S. Highway 59 corridor. This feature was nearly-stationary and thunderstorms repeatedly developed and moved along this boundary. The axis of heaviest rain was coincident with this boundary.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Extensive flooding in and around the Sharpstown area. One 17 year old female fatality with one 18 year old male injury when van they were driving became flooded outside of high school. Flooding extended into Houston metro with numerous flooded or completely submerged vehicles. 300 homes flooded.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The extremely heavy rain resulted in widespread flooding across Mitchell county.  Before the flooding began, the complex of thunderstorms had a history of producing winds in excess of 60 mph and hail to the size of golf balls.  The largest hail was reported near Damar and Stockton in Rooks county, and around Webber in Jewell county.  Winds of 60 to 80 mph were also reported and caused damage from Smith Center to Glen Elder.  In Smith Center, a roof was torn from a church by the high wind while windows were blown out of a downtown business.  Large tree limbs were reported down in the Glen Elder area.  Electricity was lost to several locations throughout the night.By late evening, radar estimates and reports from around Mitchell county began to paint a picture of torrential rainfall and widespread flooding across the county.  About 8 inches of rain was reported in Beloit, with 8 to 12 inches measured south and east of town.  Water was over Highway 14 south of Beloit.  The road was blocked off for a time.  There were reports of numerous bridges and roads under water or washed out from west of Beloit to the east end of the county along and near the Solomon River.  At the Indian Creek Bridge about 2 miles west of Beloit, a farmer narrowly escaped death as his tractor collapsed the bridge and he was washed into the creek and eventually into the Solomon River.  After being washed downstream by the raging current, the farmer grabbed a hold of some tree branches along the river and pulled himself to safety from the water.  He suffered minor injuries from the ordeal.The Solomon River was out of its banks from west of Beloit downstream to Simpson.  The river crested around 25 feet at Beloit or about 5 feet above flood stage.  The flow recorded by the USGS at Simpson on the eastern Mitchell county line was greater than the flow recorded in 1993.  Throughout Mitchell county, economic losses due to soil erosion, crop flooding and structural damage to farmstead buildings totaled from 1 to 3 million dollars.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The Pelahatchie Creek experienced a 100 year flood. The Chunky River, at Chunky, set a new record. This river actually flooded a portion of Interstate 20 which had to be closed for a few hours. The Chickasawhay River at Enterprise also set a record. In addition to all the flash flooding, the river flooding caused major damage to homes and flooded numerous roads.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Continued heavy rains dumped 7 to 12 inches of rain over Scott county.

A total of 5.47 inches of rain was recorded in Wanamingo in 24 hours, 2.8 inches of which fell between 9:30 and 10:30 PM.  An unnamed creek which flows into the North Fork Zumbro River rose 20 feet above its normal 1 foot level and rushed over Highway 1 about 1 mile south of the Highway 30 intersection in Wanamingo Township, about 4 miles west of Wanamingo. By 10:30 PM the creek completed covered the road in rushing water up to 2.5 feet deep and shortly thereafter two separate vehicles were swept off the roadway and were washed down the creek.  One vehicle, a pickup truck, was found in a nearby ditch with a smashed windshield and badly damaged hood.  The body of the driver, a 47-year-old man, was found three quarters of a mile downstream under farm equipment nearly a day and a half later when the water finally subsided. The man, who lived in Hayfield, was on his way to work in Cannon Falls.  The other vehicle that was washed off the road and into the creek was a sedan. The driver, a 50-year-old Kenyon woman who was on her way home from work, exited the car through an open window after traveling about ½ mile downstream. She floated on her back down the creek until lightning illuminated a nearby fencepost which she grabbed hold of until rescuers arrived two hours later.  Incredibly she survived the ordeal with only bruises. The rushing creek was also responsible for washing out 200 feet of gradual slope along Highway 1 near the road. Scattered debris was also found in farm fields along the creek's banks for several miles.  In addition, an unnamed creek that flows into the North Fork Zumbro River about 2 miles east of Wanamingo inundated the Shades of Sherwood campground around 10:30 PM.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The heaviest rains fell on the northeastern quadrant of the city where extensive flash flooding occurred.  As much as three inches of rain fell between 3 and 4:30 pm as thunderstorms trained over the same small area.  An elderly couple was killed around 4:15 pm after they drove their automobile into a flooded underpass on State Route 611 (Henderson Road) just a couple blocks east of State Route 57 (Broadway).  The underpass filled with more than 12 feet of water in just a few minutes.  Efforts to rescue the couple were unsuccessful.  An automated rain gage just south of the underpass recorded 2.56 inches of rain between 3 and 4 pm and a total of 2.76 inches by 4:30 pm.  A second underpass on State Route 57 (East 28th Street) was flooded by as much as ten feet of water.  Much of Broadway Road was reported to be flowing "like a river" during the peak of the storm.  Severe flooding was reported on most of the major thoroughfares in the northeastern portion of Lorain including Elyria Road, North Ridge Road, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Oberlin Avenue.   Flood waters on Elyria Road were as much as six feet deep with two to three feet of flowing water reported at other locations.  Dozens of vehicles became stranded in the flood waters and rescue efforts were severely hampered by the widespread nature of the flooding.  Industrial areas south and west of the Black River were inundated by flood waters.  Damage to homes and business in the City of Lorain and Sheffield Township from both flash flooding and basement flooding was extensive.   At least 14 families were displaced by flooding.   At least five City of Lorain police cars were destroyed by flooding.  Flooding also was reported along Beaver Creek on the west side of Lorain.  The creek left it's bank and damaged several homes.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.2M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Storm totals averaged from four to six inches with amounts exceeding eight inches toward the Lehigh Valley. The heavy rain caused widespread poor drainage flooding as well as flooding along the smaller creeks in the county. The flooding also resulted in the death of a 19-year-old woman in Milford Township. She lost control of her vehicle while trying to cross a flooded road over the Molasses Creek. Her vehicle hit a guardrail and flipped into the flooded creek. Dozens of roads were impassable with the greatest reported closures in Lower Makefield, Bridgeton and New Hope. The Neshaminy Creek at Langhorne was above its 9 foot flood stage from 1026 p.m. EDT on the 8th through 828 a.m. EDT on the 9th. It crested at 11.74 feet at 445 a.m. EDT on the 9th. Flooding also occurred early that evening at the confluence of the Neshaminy Creek and Delaware River in Bristol and Bensalem Townships at the time of the high tide. Storm totals included 7.52 inches in Sellersville, 6.32 inches in Furlong, 6.01 inches in Doylestown, 5.99 inches in Perkasie, 5.98 inches in Neshaminy Falls and 4.44 inches in Southampton. This heavy rain helped the state of Pennsylvania have its second wettest October on record dating back to 1895. The statewide average precipitation total was 6.49 inches, 3.31 inches wetter than normal. Only 1976 (6.59 inches) was wetter. October 2005 was the wettest October on record at the Philadelphia International Airport with a precipitation total of 8.68 inches, 5.93 inches wetter than normal and surpassed the previous record by 2.02 inches. The cold front moved from near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at 8 p.m. EDT on the 7th, to the Susquehanna Valley in Pennsylvania at 2 a.m. EDT on the 8th, to the Poconos and Berks County in Pennsylvania and just west of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland at 8 a.m. EDT on the 8th. The cold front stalled as waves of low pressure road northeast along it. At 2 p.m. EDT on the 8th, the cold front just edged into northwestern New Jersey and the Philadelphia northwest suburbs and was still west of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. At 8 p.m. EDT that evening the cold front barely moved into the Philadelphia New Jersey suburbs and the Delmarva Peninsula. The cold front and waves of low pressure cleared the Delaware and New Jersey coasts between Midnight EDT and 2 a.m. EDT on the 9th. The slow movement and stalling coupled with an unstable air mass and tropical moisture associated with Tammy helped enhance the torrential downpours. The flooding would have been even worse if not for the unseasonably dry weather that preceded this event from the middle of August.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Storm total rainfall ranged from between 9 and 11 inches across southwest New Hampshire; and the worst flooding occurred in the Ashuelot River basin, where the community of Alstead lies.  Approximately 1000 people were evacuated in southwest New Hampshire during these floods.The most destructive flooding occurred in Alstead, where there was loss of life, totally destroyed homes and businesses, and numerous bridge washouts.  At approximately 6 AM EST, an estimated 20 to 30 foot flood wave resulted when an embankment failed.  This flood wave traveled down Warren Brook, destroying over one dozen homes, wiping out bridges, and severely damaging many other structures.  This flash flood scoured out numerous, large sections of route 123, and downed utility poles for a five mile stretch.  Downstream, this flooding took out an old double stone-arched bridge in Walpole along the Cold River.In Hinsdale, road washouts were observed with locally severe flood damage near downtown Hinsdale.  A culvert for Kilburn Brook became blocked with tree and rock debris late Saturday night and eventually gave way to wipe out a section of Main Street (Route 119), destroying an abandoned house.Two known fatalities resulted from this significant flood event.  One Alstead man was found dead in a cornfield near the Cold River in Langdon, succumbing to the Warren River culvert breach.  He did not leave his home after being told to evacuate.  A kayaker from Antrim was missing and presumed dead; he was last seen kayaking on the North Branch River in Antrim.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Between 8 and more than 11 inches of rain fell in roughly a five hour period in a five mile wide stripe extending from Madeira Beach northeast through Pinellas Park, then across Old Tampa Bay to west Tampa, including Tampa International Airport. The area of heaviest rain was so concentrated that downtown St. Petersburg, less than 10 miles away, recorded less than an inch of rain during the same period.  The torrential rains caused flash flooding in the areas where more than 8 inches fell. The flash flooding prompted the mayor of St. Petersburg to term the event a "hundred year flood".  In Lealman, an entire mobile home community was evacuated, and at least 60 of the homes were flooded. A partial roof collapse was reported at a big box store in St. Petersburg.  Water pouring into the store washed out several cash register stands and injured one employee as they were washed into the parking lot.  Another roof collapsed at Treasure Island. Hundreds of vehicles were stranded by the flood waters.

A large fetch of Gulf and Atlantic moisture was pulled northward ahead of the cold front, which produced a squall line of thunderstorms with very heavy rainfall. This line of thunderstorms produced 45 to 74 mph winds across a large part of central NY. Additionally, the squall line spawned an F1 tornado north of Elmira, NY. As the squall line moved east, late in the afternoon of the 16th, it slowed down and stalled for a time. Areas from Owego and Binghamton, NY, north and east through Ithaca, Cortland and Norwich, NY, to Oneida county in the western Mohawk Valley and the northern Catskills saw the brunt of the heavy rainfall from this slow moving line of storms. 1.5 to 4 inches of rain fell in just 3 hours causing significant flash flooding over many of these areas. Many hillsides and creeks turned into raging torrents, causing mudslides and debris flows that cascaded into more populated valley areas. In the urban valley regions, the flash flood reports were numerous with road washouts, highway closings, and some parking lots that were entirely flooded, ruining many cars. A mudslide on Interstate 88 outside of Port Crane, NY caused a multi-car pile up. The flash flooding evolved into a minor to moderate river flood event mainly on the Susquehanna River and its tributaries in New York from Thursday night the 16th until Saturday the 18th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A mud slide on interstate 88 resulted in a multi-injury car accident.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The storm initially brought one to two inches of heavy rainfall to parts of western Washington on the 14th, producing areas of urban and small stream flooding and overwhelming drainage systems.  Widespread strong damaging winds followed, impacting the entire state as the storm center tracked from well off the coast east across the region near the British Columbia border. |In western Washington, peak winds reached 80 to 90 mph along the coast and elsewhere 60 to 75 mph.  A few locations had gusts as high 85 mph in the interior. Mountain areas recorded peak wind speeds reached in excess of 100 mph, including 113 mph at Chinook Pass and 100 mph at Sunrise in Mt Rainier National Park.|The wind storm, the strongest since the 1993 Inauguration Day Wind Storm, blew down thousands of trees and knocked power out to close to 1.5 million customers in western Washington.  The strong winds damaged major transmission lines, power poles and other power utility infrastructure. Trees also fell onto houses, street signs, street lights, parked cars, fences, railings and rooftops. |There were four fatalities as a direct result of the storm and eleven indirect fatalities following the storm from carbon monoxide poisoning, encountering downed power lines and a candle started house fire. Three people in western Washington were killed by fallen trees and one person drowned in Seattle when their basement filled with rain runoff. Eight of the indirect fatalities were from carbon monoxide poisoning and another 275 people were treated from the poisoning in King county alone. Two people were electrocuted by downed power lines and one man died after his home burned apparently started by a candle used for light.  36 people were directly injured by the wind storm.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> In the Madison Valley area of Seattle, heavy rainfall produced excessive street runoff, flooding about 25 basements and drowning one woman trapped in her basement by rapidly rising water.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 750.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Floodwaters were so deep and running so swiftly at the San Antonio High School West Campus that they collapsed a masonry wall and filled the school with almost five feet of muddy water.  Hallways were flooded, and desks, computers and boxes were tossed and thrown together. The students were moved to classrooms in another building across the district. A young man was driving to work in the mid afternoon of August 16 when his vehicle struck a guardrail on Southwest Military Drive and was knocked into Six Mile Creek near South Flores Street.  The young man called his family to say he had had an accident, then exited the vehicle but drowned as he attempted to move to higher ground.  Near midnight a young woman was driving with three friends and a baby near North Star Mall when she accidentally drove her sport utility vehicle into deeper water where it was slammed against a bridge and then was swept into a drainage ditch.  The three other adults in the vehicle were able to get baby out of the vehicle through the window and escape.  But when the three looked back for the driver, she was gone.  Her body was found later by emergency responders when the water receded.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The two boundaries collided near Marble Falls shortly after midnight on June 26 and produced sustained periods of very heavy rainfall across several counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Two lines of thunderstorms, one moving south from the Dallas area and one moving southeast from the Abilene area, intersected and stalled near Marble Falls, producing a sustained heavy rainfall over Burnet County from just before midnight into the early and mid morning hours.  General rainfall over the southern half of Burnet County was between 10 and 15 inches with the highest rain totals in the Marble Falls area, where up to 19 inches fell. The hardest hit area was Marble Falls, where more than 315 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.  The worst of the damage occurred along Whitman Branch Creek.  This included businesses and even a day care facility.  Personnel from Texas Military Forces were mobilized and sent into Marble Falls to help with rescues and evacuations.  The military personnel, along with swift water rescue and other first responders, completed 32 high water rescues and evacuated hundreds of residents.  Shelters were set up at the Marble Falls Middle School.  At least eight bridges in Burnet County were destroyed with some amount of damage to nearly every road and structure in the southern half of the county.  Most roads remained closed all day, but a few were re-opened in the late afternoon.  Cars and vans were strewn all up and down US281 in the Marble Falls area.  Nearly all parks and lakes were closed.  Businesses in Marble Falls were also closed. Drinking water in Marble Falls was contaminated by the flood and over 1000 residents were without water for at least a week. Total estimates of the damages were placed at $130,000,000.  One swift water rescue team member was forced to save himself when his vehicle was washed off SH71 near Double Horn Creek.  He was able to get to dry land after a prolonged struggle.  A couple in Marble Falls awoke to find their home flooded and with the water rising rapidly.  They scrambled to the highest point in the one-story house as the water continued to rise.  Finally, they had to use a shotgun to blast holes in the ceiling so they could break through to climb up on the roof.  They waited with their two dogs on the roof in the dark for 2 hours, then were able to climb down and take shelter in a barn as the water receded slightly.  They waited for an additional 12 hours until they were finally rescued by boat.  Two young men were attempting to drive from a home in Marble Falls to Leander via FM 1431 sometime in the early morning hours of June 27 when their jeep was swept into high water east of Marble Falls. The vehicle was located a few days later in a creek about 10 miles east of Marble Falls.  The body of one of the young men was recovered several days later but the remains of the other young man have not been found.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 137.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Phenomenal rainfall totals occurred during this period, ranging anywhere from 8 inches, to as much as 20 inches, heaviest across southeast Kansas. A few the most extreme and measured rainfall reports from June 28th - 30th were 18.29 inches at Fredonia, 12.47 inches at Independence, 11.70 inches at Iola, 9.18 inches at Chanute, 8.63 inches at Erie and 8.40 inches at Coffeyville. Excessive runoff produced widespread, catastrophic, record flooding across much of southeast Kansas, particularly in the vicinity of area rivers, streams and creeks. Hardest hit were the Verdigris and Fall Rivers, where record flooding was observed at Fall River, Independence and Coffeyville. The Neosho River was also hard hit with record flooding observed at Erie and major flooding observed at Chanute, Parsons and Oswego. Public, private and crop damage was extensive and at times severe. Hundreds to potentially a few thousand homes and businesses sustained severe flood damage, an incalculable number of roads were closed due to high water, and several bridges were either washed out or sustained damage. Thousands of acres of crops sustained severe damage. Thousands of miles of roads were damaged from the flood waters. Evacuations and water rescues were common, as several towns were for a time surrounded and/or engulfed by flood waters. Water became unsafe, as flood waters inundated water and sewage treatment plants. Thousands of residents were without power for an extended period of time. Several counties were declared federal disaster areas. Public and private damages likely exceeded hundreds of millions of dollars, but exact monetary values will be difficult to nearly impossible to determine. The flooding in Coffeyville enveloped the Coffeyville Resources Refinery. A malfunctioning pump lead to a 71,000 gallon crude oil spill into the Verdigris River, leaving an oily gunk on everything the oil touched, and contaminating the water for miles. One fatality occurred in Coffeyville, when a gentleman refused to evacuate his motel room, despite being warned twice by emergency officials of the impending flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Extremely heavy rainfall from the end of June into early July caused flash flooding throughout Montgomery County. The hardest hit areas were Independence and Coffeyville. The flash flooding combined with the ensuing record river flooding along the Verdigris River led to at least 500 homes being destroyed with another 55 sustaining major damages. Businesses in the county reported 23 million in losses and the cost to public infrastructure resulted in another 4 million in damages. Additionally, 43,000 acres of cropland were flooded. The Verdigris River also overtopped a levee protecting the refinery in Coffeyville resulting in an oily toxic mess that inundated areas downstream. The Verdigris River at Independence crested at 52.4 feet in the morning hours of July 1st. This was 22.4 feet above flood stage. At Coffeyville the river crested at 30.7 feet the evening of July 1st which is 12.7 above flood stage. Again, both of these crests were records. The river remained above flood stage for both cities until July 7th. Unfortunately there was one fatality. A 55 year old man was found in the Budget Inn in Coffeyville. An autopsy revealed that the individual died as a result of drowning. This tragedy was compounded by the fact that the individual was warned twice that floodwaters would inundate the hotel but on both occasions the individual refused to leave. The Coffeyville Journal and the Arkansas City Traveler contributed to this report.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 81.15M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Erin moved onshore near Lamar, TX as a weak tropical storm, but was quickly downgraded to a tropical depression as it moved over land. The tropical depression moved northwest over the Edwards Plateau toward west Texas. Erin maintained her depression status as it then began to move northeast into southwest Oklahoma between Hollis and Erick during the afternoon hours of Saturday, August 18th. A very tropical airmass was in place along and east of this feature, extending into western and central Oklahoma. Heavy rainfall developed along and east of the center, which moved slowly to the northeast. Low-level wind shear north and east of Erin increased throughout the evening, with several tornadoes reported in Kiowa, Washita, and Grady counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Damage was reported east of Hobart, and in Washita county south and east of Cordell. As the evening progressed, a strong low-level jet developed, with additional thunderstorms developing over southwest and central Oklahoma. Remarkably, the center of the tropical depression strengthened between 1 and 7 AM, with a compact area of sustained winds of 35 to 45 MPH concentrated around the center of the depression. Wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph were also reported over parts of central Oklahoma at this time. As with the wind speeds, thunderstorms intensities increased, with two additional tornadoes reported over central Oklahoma Sunday morning. In addition to tornadoes and very strong winds, rainfall rates of over three inches per hour were common, with significant flash flooding reported in numerous counties. Rainfall amounts exceeded five inches over a large area, with some locations receiving eight to ten inches. Rivers and creeks easily exceeded their banks, with water also rising quickly in many towns.
