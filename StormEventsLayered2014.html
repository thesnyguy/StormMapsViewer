This complex encountered a very unstable air mass near a weak surface trough over Northern and Eastern Oklahoma and Northern Arkansas as it continued southeastward. At the same time, other scattered showers and thunderstorms developed over Central and Eastern Arkansas near this surface trough, while also aided by a weak upper level disturbance sinking south across Arkansas and the Mid-Mississippi Valley. The Eastern Oklahoma storm complex absorbed the growing storm complex over Central Arkansas, resulting in a large mesoscale convective system (MCS) intensifying and surging south into Southeast Oklahoma and Southwest Arkansas during the mid and late afternoon hours. Widespread wind damage was reported across much of Central and Southern Arkansas as well as Southeast Oklahoma, with a large cold pool of air surging south into Northeast Texas and North Louisiana by late afternoon and early evening. Wind gusts ranged from 50-70 mph with this MCS as it surged south across much of the Ark-La-Tex, resulting in numerous downed trees, power lines, and structural damage. This storm complex weakened during the early evening hours, although the resultant cold pool still produced 40-45 mph wind gusts which produced minor tree damage over portions of Deep East Texas that did not see showers or thunderstorms. Over 500,000 AEP SWEPCO customers were without power after the storms blew through, with many thousands of other customers with other utility companies also without power.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 64 year old female was walking in the 1900 block of Weinstock Street and was killed by a tree that fell on top of her.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The wave took on a strong negative tilt and moved into a moist and very unstable air mass. The outcome was a widespread severe weather event for Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho producing large hail, flash flooding, and widespread wind damage. Falling trees led to some injuries in Eastern Washington.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Damaging winds led to widespread tree damage across central Bonner County.  A navy bouy located on the south end of Lake Pend Oreille clocked a wind gust of 75 mph.  Multiple trees were knocked down across the city of Sandpoint and smaller communities surrounding Lake Pend Oreille.  Many roads were closed until trees and power lines were removed including Highway 95 near the intersection of McArthur Street.  Power was out for the entire city of Sandpoint and majority of Bonner County directly following the storm.  Several trees fell on houses.  Southern exposed bays on Lake Pend Oreille experienced the worst damage.  Over thirty trees were knocked down between Gamlin Lake and Garfield Bay.  Two people were injured by a falling tree at Green Bay.  Further north on the lake, roughly twenty trees were downed in Shaw Bay.  On a ridge, known as Hawkins Point, over fifty trees were snapped four feet from the ground.  The winds created three to six foot waves in sections of the lake resulting in dock and boat damage.  Broadcast media also reported numerous trees downed at the Western Pleasure Guest Ranch located eleven miles northeast of Ponderay.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Plenty of instability and moisture was available for the line to mature into a severe bow-echo with the bulk of this racing northwest of the area into Wisconsin and Central Lower Michigan. The southern flank of this line did briefly take on bowing characteristics, producing gusty winds over southern Lake Michigan into portions of northwestern Indiana and far southwestern Lower Michigan before dissipating. Behind this line, a much stronger line of thunderstorms rapidly developed on a pre-frontal trough in northern Illinois. This line had much more favorable parameters to work with deep layer shear to 50 knots and a rapidly increasing low level jet to 50 knots. As this second line of convection raced into northwestern Indiana during the late evening hours, several stronger circulations were noted along the leading edge that lead to multiple tornado confirmations and swaths of at times extensive wind damage.

Plenty of instability and moisture was available for the line to mature into a severe bow-echo with the bulk of this racing northwest of the area into Wisconsin and Central Lower Michigan. The southern flank of this line did briefly take on bowing characteristics, producing gusty winds over southern Lake Michigan into portions of northwestern Indiana and far southwestern Lower Michigan before dissipating. Behind this line, a much stronger line of thunderstorms rapidly developed on a pre-frontal trough in northern Illinois. This line had much more favorable parameters to work with deep layer shear to 50 knots and a rapidly increasing low level jet to 50 knots. As this second line of convection raced into northwestern Indiana during the late evening hours, several stronger circulations were noted along the leading edge that lead to multiple tornado confirmations and swaths of at times extensive wind damage. The second event continued into July 1st with additional wind damage and confirmed tornadoes occurring during the early morning hours.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Emergency management officials reported a large, rotten tree fell onto the bedroom of a mobile home in the Fairlane Mobile Home Park.

Isolated thunderstorms occurred through the afternoon over the Sandhills, generally dissipating as they moved southeast into South Central Nebraska. However, by late afternoon thunderstorms intensified with supercells and high-end multicells becoming dominant. The most intense storm of this event produced a prolific swath of significant severe weather. This storm formed over Loup County around 4 p.m. CDT and subsequently tracked south-southeastward through Valley, Sherman, eastern Buffalo, Adams and Webster counties. By 9 p.m. CDT, the storm finally reached the Nebraska-Kansas border. It was responsible for producing hail up to the size of golf balls and winds of 60 to 90 MPH. Hail turned the ground white from Loup City to Ravenna to Gibbon. Combined with the severe winds, tremendous damage occurred to many homes with vinyl siding in these areas. Windows were even broken. The hail and wind caused severe crop damage as well, stripping the corn of its leaves and leaving little but shredded stalks. The scar from damaged crops remained visible, in even relatively low-resolution GOES satellite imagery, the rest of the summer. A semi-tractor trailer was blown on its side on Interstate 80, just southeast of Kearney. Winds were measured as high as 85 MPH in the town of Norman. Other storms became severe over the Sandhills and affected other portions of Valley, Greeley, Howard and Sherman counties during the early to mid-evening hours. These storms also produce hail up to the size of golf balls. Scattered thunderstorms continued to develop into the late evening and even the overnight hours from Broken Bow southward to Beaver City. Winds were estimated between 60 and 70 MPH with some of these storms, along with hail up to the size of ping pong balls.||These storms all developed in an upslope flow regime, north of a quasi-stationary front, with high pressure over the Midwest. The front extended from northwest to southeast across Nebraska and bisected South Central Nebraska, separating temperatures in the 80s to near 90 from rain cooled air in the 60s and 70s, during the late afternoon hours. Aloft, subtropical high pressure was over New Mexico with a low amplitude ridge over the Rockies and a trough over the eastern United States. These storms formed on the eastern fringe of the instability gradient. Poor mid-level lapse rates and cool surface temperatures, resulting in innocuous MLCAPE of 500 to 1500 J/kg. Deep layer shear was between 40 and 50 knots.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Strong outflow from the parent thunderstorm located to the east of this path produced wind gusts estimated to be near 70 MPH. There were numerous reports of tree damage in the area, including a large tree limb estimated to be 12 inches in diameter downed and a tree estimated to be 30 inches in diameter snapped at the base and then fell onto a home.  The elderly resident of this home suffered injuries when shards of glass entered the home from the combination of wind and hail. The top of a grain bin was blown off and vinyl siding was partially torn off one side of a home.  On Interstate 80, near exit 279 southeast of Kearney, a semi truck was blown onto its side.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This MCV then became a derecho Monday evening as it moved and bowed east through eastern North Dakota and the northern Minnesota and northern Wisconsin late Monday and early Tuesday (July 22nd).  This derecho caused widespread wind damage from winds of at least 50 to 70 mph over much of northeast Minnesota, blowing and/or snapping trees and knocking out power.

A poorly secured metal roof of a mobile home on Singing Pines Drive was completely lifted from the home. Several large hardwoods were uprooted along Singing Pines Drive and nearby Old Railroad Road. Power lines were also reported down. The microburst weakened, but severe winds still uprooted several trees and downed large limbs along Wayside Road, Juniper Bay Road and Dunn Short Cut Road. The ground was very saturated and almost all of the uprooted trees were hardwoods. The maximum path width was 1.8 miles and the path length was 2.35 miles.

A low pressure system was located in north central South Dakota by Monday evening, and its stationary front extended to the northeast through eastern North Dakota and Northwest Wisconsin.  Temperatures were in the middle 80s to low 90s in the warm sector, and the combination of dew point temperatures in the upper 60s to middle 70s resulted in heat indices in the 90s to 100s.  Thunderstorms developed during the late afternoon and early evening in western North Dakota and formed a mesoscale convective complex.  This MCV then became a derecho Monday evening as it moved and bowed east through eastern North Dakota and the northern Minnesota and northern Wisconsin late Monday and early Tuesday (July 22nd).  This derecho caused widespread wind damage from winds of at least 50 to 70 mph over much of northeast Minnesota, blowing and/or snapping trees and knocking out power.  There were more focused areas of structural damage that suggested there were winds in excess of 70 mph.  There were several injuries to campers in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness due to falling trees, which required officials to make some rescues.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Two campers were injured from a tree falling on their campsite on Loon Lake.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The wave took on a strong negative tilt and moved into a moist and very unstable air mass.  The outcome was a widespread severe weather event for Eastern Washington and Northern Idaho producing large hail, flash flooding, and widespread wind damage.  Large hail and heavy rain were the initial threats early in the afternoon.  Late in the afternoon, the threat shifted to damaging winds with hundreds of downed or snapped trees.  The hardest hit areas were Northeastern Washington and Northern Idaho.  Falling trees led to some injuries in Eastern Washington.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A wet microburst brought sustained winds of 35 to 50 mph with gusts 60 to 70 mph across Spokane County.  The winds descended near Cheney and peaked while passing through Airway Heights, Northwestern Spokane, and Deer Park.  Hundreds of Ponderosa Pines were snapped and downed from Northwestern Spokane to Deer Park.  Downed trees led to widespread structural damage, blocked roads, power outages, and injuries.  Significant damage was observed at the Riverside Village Mobile Home Park from trees falling on mobile homes prompting a search and rescue.  One woman was trapped but was not injured.  At least 40 mobile homes and cars in the park were severely damaged.  Forty eight trees were knocked down at a resort on Lake Eloika.  Trees fell on six RVs and the resort's oldest cabin forcing the owners to close their doors for a short period of time.  One person was injured when a tree landed on his vehicle while driving along Lakeside Dr near Reflection Lake in Elk, WA.  A tree branch flew through his windshield and drove him off the road severing his arm and impaling his hip.  He eventually lost his arm in the accident.  Three other people were injured near the Spokane Courthouse by falling tree branches.  Over 30,000 people lost power during the event.  Because of the extent of damage, some residents and businesses remained in the dark for up to four days.  Downed power poles and lightning strikes sparked several new wildfires which quickly grew due to the strong winds.  The winds completely damaged a airport hanger and caused between ten to twelve thousand dollars worth of damage to planes.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

During the early evening hours, one cluster of thunderstorms raced northward from central Alabama at speeds of 50 to 60 mph, and produced areas of significant wind damage, snapping power poles, and large trees.  A couple of discrete supercells developed in northeast Mississippi ahead of a squall line and tracked across northwest Alabama.  This was followed by the squall line which slowly migrated across the area producing one EF-1 tornado in Colbert County. Sporadic wind damage, and heavy rainfall accompanied this secondary wave which also led to isolated flash flooding.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A wide swath of hardwood trees were snapped or uprooted between Good Hope and South Vinemont.

This outbreak started across the Central Plains on the 27th and slowly migrated eastward over the following two days. A large tornado outbreak occurred across the Lower MS River & TN River Valleys on the 28th. The event was capped on the 30th with additional severe weather and a historic flash flooding/heavy rain event along the AL, FL gulf coast where rainfall totals peaked between 15-25 inches!||Across the NWS Jackson, MS forecast area, the tornado outbreak on the 28th was the main event. This event was driven by a classic severe weather pattern with a strong fast moving jet stream and a deep surface cyclone over the central plains. These features helped to produce strong wind shear in the atmosphere which in turn combined with rich gulf moisture and setup a volatile atmospheric mix. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed during the afternoon/evening and produced many instances of damaging wind and large hail along with multiple tornadoes. The most devastating tornado was the EF-4 which tore a path across NE Leake, the corners of Attala/Neshoba counties, and through the heart of Winston County where the city of Louisville was especially hard hit. This tornado was on ground for 34.3 miles and resulted in 10 fatalities and many injuries. Other hard hit counties were Lowndes, Rankin, Hinds, Scott, Newton, Montgomery, Warren and Jones. Each of these counties experienced at least one tornado, some multiple tornadoes. Overall, 21 tornadoes were confirmed across the forecast area. Of these tornadoes, 3 were rated EF-3, 3 rated EF-2, 12 rated EF1 and 2 rated EF-0.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Several trees were blown down in the area.

The three were trying to make their way back to Paragon.||The driver of the car attempted to drive through high water. Officials say the road did not have a high water sign because it is so infrequently traveled.||After the driver entered the water, she tried to reverse, but the car was taken into the water.

Rising river levels and ice jams led to flooding across portions of northern and eastern Maine. High temperatures on the 14th generally ranged from around 60 to the mid 60s north...to the mid 60s Downeast. These temperatures produced rapid snow melt which led to rising river and stream levels. The rising rivers caused ice to move which led to ice jams. Heavy rains then occurred across the region from the 15th into the 16th in advance of a cold front...with totals of 1.00 to 2.00 inches. Runoff from this rain...in addition to the melting snow...further contributed to rising river levels and ice jams.|River and stream flooding began to develop during the afternoon and evening of the 15th related to the rapid runoff due to snow melt and heavy rains along with ice jams. Runoff from fields and hills overwhelmed culverts and poor drainage areas which contributed to flooding and road closures along with the only fatality of the event. |Significant flooding across Piscataquis and Washington counties lasted into the afternoon of the 17th.

Heavy rain then occurred during the 15th in advance of a slow moving cold front along with continued mild temperatures which contributed to further runoff. Rainfall totals during the 15th generally ranged from 1.00 to 2.00 inches. |Flooding began to develop during the afternoon of the 15th due to rising river and stream levels along with ice jams. Additional flooding was due to runoff from fields and hills which overwhelmed culverts and produced standing water in poor drainage areas. Road closures due to both types of flooding began to develop during the afternoon of the 15th. The number of road closures then steadily increased across the entire county through the remainder of the 15th into the 16th...with numerous road closures persisting into the 18th. |Flooding occurred along portions of both the Aroostook River and Saint John River. Numerous roads were closed around Fort Fairfield...on the Aroostook River...starting on the afternoon of the 15th due to elevated river levels and several ice jams. The final ice jams released during the afternoon of the 16th allowing water levels to recede.  Several forecast points along the Aroostook River reached flood stage. An ice jam caused the river at Washburn to briefly spike above flood stage for around 2 hours during the overnight hours of the 15th into the 16th...cresting around 2.5 feet above flood stage. At Masardis...the river rose above flood stage during the early morning hours of the 16th...crested around a foot above flood stage that afternoon...then fell below flood stage later that evening. Elevated river levels and ice jams contributed to flooding along portions of the Saint John River. An ice jam affected the Saint Francis area during the morning of the 16th resulting in minor flooding. A more significant ice jam...estimated to be 3 to 4 miles long...then affected the Saint Francis area during the 17th into the early morning of the 18th before releasing. This ice jam closed portions of Route 161 between Saint Francis and Allagash due to water and large chunks of ice covering the road. This ice jam also caused the voluntary evacuation of 5 homes along the river for precautionary reasons. When this ice jam released the ice contributed to elevated river levels further downstream...from Hamlin to Van Buren...where portions of Route 1A were briefly closed. Many small streams also overflowed across the county contributing to flooding. Other towns affected by flooding and road closures included Bridgewater...Caribou...Castle Hill...Easton...Hodgdon...Houlton...Mapleton...Presque Isle...Westfield and Wytopitlock.  |Non river flooding also occurred across the region due to the runoff of heavy rain and snow melt from fields and hills. This runoff overwhelmed culverts which led to flooding and road closures...with flooding also occurring in poor drainage areas. The one fatality during this event was due to runoff from fields which had flooded a dirt road in the Caswell area. After moving his vehicle...the individual attempted to walk back across the flooded road and stepped into the fast moving water of a culvert which swept him away resulting in his drowning. This fatality occurred during the evening of the 15th. The monetary damage represents a total from 4 towns.

This outbreak started across the Central Plains on the 27th and slowly migrated eastward over the following two days. A large tornado outbreak occurred across the Lower MS River & TN River Valleys on the 28th. The event was capped on the 30th with additional severe weather and a historic flash flooding/heavy rain event along the AL, FL gulf coast where rainfall totals peaked between 15-25 inches!||Across the NWS Jackson, MS forecast area, the tornado outbreak on the 28th was the main event. This event was driven by a classic severe weather pattern with a strong fast moving jet stream and a deep surface cyclone over the central plains. These features helped to produce strong wind shear in the atmosphere which in turn combined with rich gulf moisture and setup a volatile atmospheric mix. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed during the afternoon/evening and produced many instances of damaging wind and large hail along with multiple tornadoes. The most devastating tornado was the EF-4 which tore a path across NE Leake, the corners of Attala/Neshoba counties, and through the heart of Winston County where the city of Louisville was especially hard hit. This tornado was on ground for 34.3 miles and resulted in 10 fatalities and many injuries. Other hard hit counties were Lowndes, Rankin, Hinds, Scott, Newton, Montgomery, Warren and Jones. Each of these counties experienced at least one tornado, some multiple tornadoes. Overall, 21 tornadoes were confirmed across the forecast area. Of these tornadoes, 3 were rated EF-3, 3 rated EF-2, 12 rated EF1 and 2 rated EF-0.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado developed just east of Forest, and quickly became intense along Old Highway 80. Just south of this road, it nearly destroyed a wood frame home, downing all but the most interior walls and carrying the debris away from the foundation. Three people were injured in this home, one seriously. It also completely destroyed a chicken house and also carried that debris well away. Numerous trees were snapped and uprooted in this area as well. Shortly after causing this damage...the tornado weakened, and it dissipated after crossing Mcmillan Road. Maximum winds were around 140 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 700.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A large tornado outbreak occurred across the Lower MS River & TN River Valleys on the 28th.

This event was driven by a classic severe weather pattern with a strong fast moving jet stream and a deep surface cyclone over the central plains. These features helped to produce strong wind shear in the atmosphere which in turn combined with rich gulf moisture and setup a volatile atmospheric mix. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed during the afternoon/evening and produced many instances of damaging wind and large hail along with multiple tornadoes.

This tornado was on ground for 34.3 miles and resulted in 10 fatalities and many injuries. Other hard hit counties were Lowndes, Rankin, Hinds, Scott, Newton, Montgomery, Warren and Jones. Each of these counties experienced at least one tornado, some multiple tornadoes. Overall, 21 tornadoes were confirmed across the forecast area.

Just south of this road, it nearly destroyed a wood frame home, downing all but the most interior walls and carrying the debris away from the foundation. Three people were injured in this home, one seriously. It also completely destroyed a chicken house and also carried that debris well away. Numerous trees were snapped and uprooted in this area as well. Shortly after causing this damage...the tornado weakened, and it dissipated after crossing Mcmillan Road.

There were several reports of damaging winds and large hail. Also, four tornadoes occurred in our area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado developed over the north side of Martinsburg, Illinois. One home sustained minor roof and fascia damage and one window was damaged along the south side of the home.  A few large trees and several large branches were downed by the tornado.  The tornado then traveled east-northeast and sheared a path of large pine trees 30 to 40 feet tall half a mile north of Martinsburg along and west of County Road 11.  Many of the pine trees were snapped from near the base to half way up the trunk.  The width of this damage area was 80 yards.  The next damage was found approximately 300 yards south of the intersection of County Road 7 and 205th Avenue.  A one story residence home sustained minor fascia damage and a few pine trees were snapped at the bases.  The tornado then totally destroyed a medium size machine shed on the south side of Watsons Cemetery east of the intersection. Several tomb stones were damaged.  Approximately 300 yards east of the cemetery another farmstead sustained damage.  Two empty medium size grain bins were destroyed while another machine shed was destroyed.  Damage was found again at another farmstead located 1 mile west of Detroit, Illinois.  The east side of a two story farm house was moved off its foundation by 5 inches while part of the east side of the roof was tossed to the east.  The upper half of a large barn was removed and tossed to the east. One old machine shed was completely destroyed while two canvas hoop sheds were completely destroyed.  Debris from the machine sheds were tossed a quarter of a mile to the east.  The tornado crossed Illinois Route 106 about a mile west of Detroit and damaged several large trees.  The tornado then directly hit a hog building which was supported by steel I-beams.  The southern part of the structure was pushed to the north and northeast.  Debris from the roof of this structure was tossed over half a mile to the northeast.  The damage width over this area was 80 yards wide.  Damage to this structure was rated EF-2. The tornado continued to the northeast destroying a shed before lifting and dissipating about a mile north northeast of Detroit. Several people were in the area of the shed working on repairing fencing.  One man sustained a minor shoulder injury and was taken to the hospital. The maximum intensity was EF2 with a maximum wind speed of 120 mph. The total path length was 12.09 miles with a maximum width 80 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

There were several reports of damaging winds and large hail. Also, four tornadoes occurred in our area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado developed over the north side of Martinsburg, Illinois. One home sustained minor roof and fascia damage and one window was damaged along the south side of the home.  A few large trees and several large branches were downed by the tornado.  The tornado then traveled east-northeast and sheared a path of large pine trees 30 to 40 feet tall half a mile north of Martinsburg along and west of County Road 11.  Many of the pine trees were snapped from near the base to half way up the trunk.  The width of this damage area was 80 yards.  The next damage was found approximately 300 yards south of the intersection of County Road 7 and 205th Avenue.  A one story residence home sustained minor fascia damage and a few pine trees were snapped at the bases.  The tornado then totally destroyed a medium size machine shed on the south side of Watsons Cemetery east of the intersection. Several tomb stones were damaged.  Approximately 300 yards east of the cemetery another farmstead sustained damage.  Two empty medium size grain bins were destroyed while another machine shed was destroyed.  Damage was found again at another farmstead located 1 mile west of Detroit, Illinois.  The east side of a two story farm house was moved off its foundation by 5 inches while part of the east side of the roof was tossed to the east.  The upper half of a large barn was removed and tossed to the east. One old machine shed was completely destroyed while two canvas hoop sheds were completely destroyed.  Debris from the machine sheds were tossed a quarter of a mile to the east.  The tornado crossed Illinois Route 106 about a mile west of Detroit and damaged several large trees.  The tornado then directly hit a hog building which was supported by steel I-beams.  The southern part of the structure was pushed to the north and northeast.  Debris from the roof of this structure was tossed over half a mile to the northeast.  The damage width over this area was 80 yards wide.  Damage to this structure was rated EF-2. The tornado continued to the northeast destroying a shed before lifting and dissipating about a mile north northeast of Detroit. Several people were in the area of the shed working on repairing fencing.  One man sustained a minor shoulder injury and was taken to the hospital. The maximum intensity was EF2 with a maximum wind speed of 120 mph. The total path length was 12.09 miles with a maximum width 80 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the tornado neared and crossed Highway 49, the intensity increased to a high end EF-1.||Multiple power lines were downed along with numerous trees, two homes had minor damage along Rock Hill Rd. A home had a portion of the roof removed along Highway 49. As the tornado crossed Byrd Town Rd, more high end tree damage occurred with some minor damage to a home and a couple mobile homes. Several sheds and carports were destroyed here as well. The tornado increased in intensity to a low end EF-2 as it crossed George Speed Rd. Here significant tree damage was noted with hundreds of snapped or uprooted pines and hardwoods. A few homes had minor damage as they were on the edges of the tornadic circulation. The tornado weakened some as it moved just north of Jones Chapel Rd and across Highway 532. The tornado increased and reached peak intensity, EF-2 (125 mph), as it crossed Vester Pickering Rd. Three mobile homes were destroyed with one well-built brick home having the roof entirely removed. Heavy tree damaged was noted here with power poles and power lines down. Just to the north of Hot Coffee, a large church was heavily damaged with part of the roof removed and some outer brick fallen off the outer wall.

A nearby barn was completely destroyed and a nearby RV was rolled approximately 10 yards. The tornado tore off much of the roof from South Lincoln Elementary school, dragged a school bus approximately 75 yards, and caused it to impact the front wall of the school. Additional damage was incurred to homes just northeast of the school, where large sections of roofing were removed. Some of the most widespread damage occurred along Price Lane where multiple mobile homes were rolled as much as 50 yards and completely destroyed. Single family homes had exterior walls collapsed and roofs removed with electrical transmission towers completely toppled. The tornado continued to produce tree and roof damage as it moved northeast across Corders Crossroads and Crystal Springs Roads. Houses were pushed off their foundations near the intersection of Howell Mill Road and Crystal Springs Road, and nearby truss electrical transmission towers were crumpled.||The tornado appeared to weaken somewhat northeast of this location as it continued to snap multiple trees and produce minor roof damage. It broadened upon crossing Highway 64 and moved along Smithland Road where it snapped hundreds more trees and a few power poles.

As the storms rolled across western Wisconsin they produced sporadic wind damage and at least 2 tornadoes in Platteville (Grant County) where 5 injuries occurred. The tornadoes caused extensive damage to the University of Wisconsin - Platteville campus and to numerous homes and business near the campus. Damage estimates to the campus alone were near $10 million. The Governor of Wisconsin declared a state of emergency for three southern Wisconsin counties, including Grant. The U.S. Small Business Administration approved a request for a disaster declaration in Grant County. The disaster declaration allows homeowners and businesses to obtain loans to repair or replace damaged or destroyed property.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado formed along a squall line west of Platteville, just south of County Road B, and traveled through Memorial Park on to the Univ. of Wisconsin - Platteville campus. Five people were injured, one of them seriously. There was extensive damage done to five buildings and the stadium on campus.  Roofs of two new residential halls were partially destroyed and a third residential hall was also damaged along with one academic building. Two large lighting structures at the football stadium were knocked over, with one crashing across the bleachers causing the concrete foundation underneath the bleachers to be substantially moved. Damage continued into nearby homes and businesses as the tornado tracked across Business Highway 151. The top level of a split level home was ripped off one house, another house lost part of a roof and a porch while several other homes had windows blown out and trees knocked down. A gas station/convenience store was leveled by the tornado where it also ripped a pump out of the ground and blew over a semi. Numerous other business and vehicles suffered blown out windows. After hitting a cemetery on the south side of town, the tornado dissipated just before reaching U.S. Highway 151 southeast of town. A total of 12 homes were destroyed with another 20 damaged.||At UW-Platteville, the tornado caused $7.3 million in damage to Bridgeway Commons, $4.8 million in damage to Rountree Commons and $1.8 million to Southwest Hall. All three buildings are dorms.||The tornado caused $1.8 million in damage to Engineering Hall, a classroom building, and $1.7 million in damage to the stadium.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the storms rolled across western Wisconsin they produced sporadic wind damage and at least 2 tornadoes in Platteville (Grant County) where 5 injuries occurred. The tornadoes caused extensive damage to the University of Wisconsin - Platteville campus and to numerous homes and business near the campus. Damage estimates to the campus alone were near $10 million. The Governor of Wisconsin declared a state of emergency for three southern Wisconsin counties, including Grant. The U.S. Small Business Administration approved a request for a disaster declaration in Grant County. The disaster declaration allows homeowners and businesses to obtain loans to repair or replace damaged or destroyed property.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado formed along a squall line west of Platteville, just south of County Road B, and traveled through Memorial Park on to the Univ. of Wisconsin - Platteville campus. Five people were injured, one of them seriously. There was extensive damage done to five buildings and the stadium on campus.  Roofs of two new residential halls were partially destroyed and a third residential hall was also damaged along with one academic building. Two large lighting structures at the football stadium were knocked over, with one crashing across the bleachers causing the concrete foundation underneath the bleachers to be substantially moved. Damage continued into nearby homes and businesses as the tornado tracked across Business Highway 151. The top level of a split level home was ripped off one house, another house lost part of a roof and a porch while several other homes had windows blown out and trees knocked down. A gas station/convenience store was leveled by the tornado where it also ripped a pump out of the ground and blew over a semi. Numerous other business and vehicles suffered blown out windows. After hitting a cemetery on the south side of town, the tornado dissipated just before reaching U.S. Highway 151 southeast of town. A total of 12 homes were destroyed with another 20 damaged.||At UW-Platteville, the tornado caused $7.3 million in damage to Bridgeway Commons, $4.8 million in damage to Rountree Commons and $1.8 million to Southwest Hall. All three buildings are dorms.||The tornado caused $1.8 million in damage to Engineering Hall, a classroom building, and $1.7 million in damage to the stadium.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Some of the storms produced hail in central Arkansas. New storms during the afternoon dropped hail in the northern and western parts of the state. The cool outflow from the morning storms left a boundary draped across the middle of the state. This boundary separated cool air to the north and much warmer air to the south. During the evening, as a strong area of low pressure approached, a supercell erupted rapidly along the boundary. Altogether, the supercell produced five separate tornadoes, the first of which was rated EF4 and killed 16 people. It was the deadliest single tornado in Arkansas since 1968. Nearly 200 people were treated at hospitals.||Large amounts of rain fell over the northeastern quarter of the state. For the 24-hour period ending at 7 AM on the 28th, some of the larger totals included 7.60 inches at Batesville Lock and Dam (Independence Co.), 6.10 inches at Calamine (Sharp Co.), 5.34 inches at Evening Shade (Sharp Co.), 5.05 inches at Melbourne (Izard Co.), 4.46 inches at Hardy (Sharp Co.), 4.18 inches at Blanchard Springs (Stone Co.), 3.96 inches at Armstead Mountain (Pope Co.), 3.95 inches at Saddle (Fulton Co.), 3.92 inches at Poughkeepsie (Sharp Co.), 3.91 inches at Greers Ferry Dam (Cleburne Co.), and 3.72 inches at Mountain View (Stone Co.).||President Barack Obama declared a disaster in the following counties:  Faulkner, Pulaski, White, Cleburne, Independence, Jackson, Izard, Sharp, and Fulton.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado exited Pulaski County 1.6 miles northeast of Roland, while crossing the Arkansas River, and entered Faulkner County 0.6 mile southwest of Palarm. The tornado reached its maximum intensity of EF4 in Faulkner County. It tracked through the River Plantation subdivision and White City, then struck Mayflower, where residences and businesses were destroyed. The tornado then moved across Interstate 40 at Mayflower, throwing cars, trucks, and road construction equipment off the freeway. Traffic along the interstate was backed up for weeks following the tornado as motorists slowed to view the damage. Next, the tornado crossed a part of Lake Conway and moved across part of Camp Robinson, a National Guard facility, where the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission lost a clubhouse, shop, horse barn, residence, metal carports, shower house, and dog kennels. The tornado then continued on through Saltillo and then caused devastation to homes and businesses in Vilonia. About 400 people had taken shelter in a safe room at the Vilonia high school. ||According to the American Red Cross, in Faulkner County, the tornado destroyed 261 houses and 121 mobile homes; caused major damage to 77 houses, 29 mobile homes, and 5 apartments; caused minor damage to 96 houses, 14 mobile homes, and 4 apartments; and affected 257 houses, 32 mobile homes, and 4 apartments. Hundreds of cars and pickup trucks were mangled along the path of the tornado. ||In Mayflower, a home improvement store was badly damaged, and a vehicle repair shop, millwork company, construction company, electric substation, and church were destroyed. A recreational vehicle dealership and dozens of RVs were also destroyed. The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission eventually removed 627 tons of tornado debris from Lake Conway. In Vilonia, the new intermediate school under construction was destroyed, as were nearly two dozen businesses along Main St. (U.S. 64B), including a dollar store, a strip mall, two auto repair shops, the old city hall, a gas station, a real estate office, an investment firm, an auto parts store, and a fried chicken restaurant. ||There were 12 fatalities in Faulkner County. In the Mayflower area, a 72-year-old woman was killed in a house on Plantation Dr., a 51-year-old man was killed in a house on Fortner Dr., and an 82-year-old man was killed in a house on Dam Rd. The other 9 fatalities were all in the Vilonia area. These included: brothers 7- and 9-years-old in a house on Cody Ln., a 50-year-old woman in a vehicle on U.S. 64, a 52-year-old man and a 53-year-old woman in a house on Cemetery Rd., a 57-year-old man in a house on North St., a 31-year-old man in a house on Aspen Creek Dr., and a 22-year-old man in a house on Clover Ridge Dr. In addition, a woman who was injured in a mobile home on Ponderosa Dr. gave birth to a baby which died immediately. More than 150 people were treated at hospitals. ||The tornado hit Vilonia three years and two days after a tornado had destroyed some of the same structures.

This outbreak started across the Central Plains on the 27th and slowly migrated eastward over the following two days. A large tornado outbreak occurred across the Lower MS River & TN River Valleys on the 28th. The event was capped on the 30th with additional severe weather and a historic flash flooding/heavy rain event along the AL, FL gulf coast where rainfall totals peaked between 15-25 inches!||Across the NWS Jackson, MS forecast area, the tornado outbreak on the 28th was the main event. This event was driven by a classic severe weather pattern with a strong fast moving jet stream and a deep surface cyclone over the central plains. These features helped to produce strong wind shear in the atmosphere which in turn combined with rich gulf moisture and setup a volatile atmospheric mix. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed during the afternoon/evening and produced many instances of damaging wind and large hail along with multiple tornadoes. The most devastating tornado was the EF-4 which tore a path across NE Leake, the corners of Attala/Neshoba counties, and through the heart of Winston County where the city of Louisville was especially hard hit. This tornado was on ground for 34.3 miles and resulted in 10 fatalities and many injuries. Other hard hit counties were Lowndes, Rankin, Hinds, Scott, Newton, Montgomery, Warren and Jones. Each of these counties experienced at least one tornado, some multiple tornadoes. Overall, 21 tornadoes were confirmed across the forecast area. Of these tornadoes, 3 were rated EF-3, 3 rated EF-2, 12 rated EF1 and 2 rated EF-0.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado initially developed just inside Hinds County along I-55 north of the Elton Road exit, where it caused some damage to a business and some trees. The tornado became intense just after crossing the Pearl River and moving into Rankin County, where it caused heavy damage to a number of commercial and industrial buildings in Richland and Pearl. EF-3 damage occurred in this area. One person was killed when the tornado picked up and threw her car when it crossed US Highway 49 in Richland. The tornado continued across more residential areas of Pearl, snapping and uprooting many trees and damaging some homes. Much of this damage was of an EF-1 intensity. As the tornado approached the Brandon city limits, it reintensified and caused high end EF-2 damage in a mobile home park near the border between Brandon and Pearl. It also caused significant roof damage to an auto dealership in Brandon and lesser damage to several other businesses. The tornado then moved across central areas of Brandon, snapping and downing a number of trees and causing some damage at the Brandon Middle School campus. The tornado continued east-northeast, passing just north of Shiloh Park, downing and snapping a number of trees in a residential area there. Most of this damage was EF-1 in nature. The tornado continued across more rural areas of Rankin County. It then crossed I-20 and caused significant damage to a gas station at the Pelahatchie exit. It passed just south of Pelahatchie and dissipated shortly after crossing into Scott County. Maximum winds were around 155 mph.

Strong and violent tornadoes, very large hail, flash flooding, and damaging straight line winds accompanied this dynamic storm system. The most tornadoes occurred across the Deep South as the system moved into Mississippi and Alabama on Monday, April 28th. Supercell thunderstorms developed during the afternoon over eastern Mississippi and northwest Alabama in the warm sector well ahead of a cold front. The activity slowly spread east and southeast overnight, with this wave of severe storms ending early Tuesday morning. Storms redeveloped late Tuesday afternoon and moved into Central Alabama. A large area of rainfall across the northern Gulf Coast limited the amount of instability across the area, and storms remained below severe limits. The last wave of severe weather occurred early Wednesday morning across the south as an isolated storm produced large hail, as the system finally pulled east of the area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado touched down near the intersection of Fosters Loop Road and Cypress Creek Road, where it snapped and uprooted hundreds of trees. It moved northeastward, crossing the Black Warrior River near Maxwell Bend.  Several homes sustained significant roof and porch damage on the east bank of the river in the River Point Subdivision. It continued moving northeast, snapping and uprooting hundreds of trees and causing mainly minor shingle and roof damage to numerous homes as it moved through several subdivisions. As the tornado continued north and eastward, the tornado crossed Old Greensboro Road where it uprooted and snapped the trunks of numerous large, old hardwoods at the Little Sandy Baptist Church. The tornado continued northeast across Highway 69 with winds of 95 mph, where it downed multiple trees on the east side of the highway. The tornado took a more easterly track and produced sporadic tree damage until it reached the Taylorwood Estates subdivision and the Bear Creek trailer park. In this area, the tornado snapped or uprooted hundreds of trees. The tornado then moved east-northeast and caused sporadic tree damage as it crossed U.S. Highway 82 and Hargrove Road. Just west of Hargrove Road, the tornado uprooted and snapped numerous hardwood and softwood trees and caused major damage to 25 mobile homes as trees fell on the homes. One small porch was ripped from a double wide mobile home. The tornado then moved through the Woodland Forest subdivision where it uprooted and snapped hundreds of trees. As the tornado approached Buttermilk Road, southerly winds got under the soffit of a single family home and ripped out a small portion of the roof. The tornado caused minor roof damage and uprooted several trees on the east side Buttermilk Road before it finally lifted. This tornado was very close to the path of the F4 tornado in 2000.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado then rapidly dissipated near Tabernacle Road where only sporadic damage was found. It is also noteworthy that several damage points south of the tornado track were consistent with straight-line winds.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This outbreak started across the Central Plains on the 27th and slowly migrated eastward over the following two days. A large tornado outbreak occurred across the Lower MS River & TN River Valleys on the 28th. The event was capped on the 30th with additional severe weather and a historic flash flooding/heavy rain event along the AL, FL gulf coast where rainfall totals peaked between 15-25 inches!||Across the NWS Jackson, MS forecast area, the tornado outbreak on the 28th was the main event. This event was driven by a classic severe weather pattern with a strong fast moving jet stream and a deep surface cyclone over the central plains. These features helped to produce strong wind shear in the atmosphere which in turn combined with rich gulf moisture and setup a volatile atmospheric mix. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed during the afternoon/evening and produced many instances of damaging wind and large hail along with multiple tornadoes. The most devastating tornado was the EF-4 which tore a path across NE Leake, the corners of Attala/Neshoba counties, and through the heart of Winston County where the city of Louisville was especially hard hit. This tornado was on ground for 34.3 miles and resulted in 10 fatalities and many injuries. Other hard hit counties were Lowndes, Rankin, Hinds, Scott, Newton, Montgomery, Warren and Jones. Each of these counties experienced at least one tornado, some multiple tornadoes. Overall, 21 tornadoes were confirmed across the forecast area. Of these tornadoes, 3 were rated EF-3, 3 rated EF-2, 12 rated EF1 and 2 rated EF-0.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado first touched down in northeastern Leake County, where the damage was mostly downed trees. As the tornado approached the 4 corners intersection of Leake, Attala, Neshoba, and Winston Counties, it strengthened and began to impact structures. Several mobile homes, medal buildings and single family homes were damaged or destroyed in this area along Highway 25. The tornado continued northeast impacting rural areas of southwest Winston County. There it intensified and began to produce EF3 and some areas of EF4 damage. Numerous homes were destroyed, trees were debarked and severe damage occurred to several chicken farms. The EF4 damage in this area was a building reduced to a slab and a chicken farm that was completely wiped away.||At this point, the tornado made a turn to a more northerly course and continued to cause EF2 and EF3 damage just south of Louisville. The tornado entered the city of Louisville on the south side along Highway 15 and continued north-northeast through the east side of the city. Widespread EF3 and EF4 damage occurred in this area. Of particular note, several industrial buildings were destroyed and an area of homes and apartments was destroyed, a few of them being completely taken down to the slab.||The tornado continued through the east side of Louisville causing mainly EF3 damage. Of particular note, the Winston Medical Center received heavy damage and became incapable of use. The tornado continued moving north-northeast roughly along McCullough Road causing EF3 and EF4 damage. Numerous homes had their roofs and walls removed and some were reduced to slabs.

This outbreak started across the Central Plains on the 27th and slowly migrated eastward over the following two days. A large tornado outbreak occurred across the Lower MS River & TN River Valleys on the 28th. The event was capped on the 30th with additional severe weather and a historic flash flooding/heavy rain event along the AL, FL gulf coast where rainfall totals peaked between 15-25 inches!||Across the NWS Jackson, MS forecast area, the tornado outbreak on the 28th was the main event. This event was driven by a classic severe weather pattern with a strong fast moving jet stream and a deep surface cyclone over the central plains. These features helped to produce strong wind shear in the atmosphere which in turn combined with rich gulf moisture and setup a volatile atmospheric mix. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed during the afternoon/evening and produced many instances of damaging wind and large hail along with multiple tornadoes. The most devastating tornado was the EF-4 which tore a path across NE Leake, the corners of Attala/Neshoba counties, and through the heart of Winston County where the city of Louisville was especially hard hit. This tornado was on ground for 34.3 miles and resulted in 10 fatalities and many injuries. Other hard hit counties were Lowndes, Rankin, Hinds, Scott, Newton, Montgomery, Warren and Jones. Each of these counties experienced at least one tornado, some multiple tornadoes. Overall, 21 tornadoes were confirmed across the forecast area. Of these tornadoes, 3 were rated EF-3, 3 rated EF-2, 12 rated EF1 and 2 rated EF-0.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado first touched down in northeastern Leake County, where the damage was mostly downed trees. As the tornado approached the 4 corners intersection of Leake, Attala, Neshoba, and Winston Counties, it strengthened and began to impact structures. Several mobile homes, medal buildings and single family homes were damaged or destroyed in this area along Highway 25. The tornado continued northeast impacting rural areas of southwest Winston County. There it intensified and began to produce EF3 and some areas of EF4 damage. Numerous homes were destroyed, trees were debarked and severe damage occurred to several chicken farms. The EF4 damage in this area was a building reduced to a slab and a chicken farm that was completely wiped away.||At this point, the tornado made a turn to a more northerly course and continued to cause EF2 and EF3 damage just south of Louisville. The tornado entered the city of Louisville on the south side along Highway 15 and continued north-northeast through the east side of the city. Widespread EF3 and EF4 damage occurred in this area. Of particular note, several industrial buildings were destroyed and an area of homes and apartments was destroyed, a few of them being completely taken down to the slab.||The tornado continued through the east side of Louisville causing mainly EF3 damage. Of particular note, the Winston Medical Center received heavy damage and became incapable of use. The tornado continued moving north-northeast roughly along McCullough Road causing EF3 and EF4 damage. Numerous homes had their roofs and walls removed and some were reduced to slabs. Near the intersection with Louisville-Brooksville Road, two particularly well built homes were very heavily damaged and received EF4 ratings.||From this point, the tornado began to weaken, causing mainly EF2 and EF3 damage along North Columbus Avenue. As it approached a second intersection with Highway 25, the tornado lifted after traveling on the ground for over 34 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.20M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Strong and violent tornadoes, very large hail, flash flooding, and damaging straight line winds accompanied this dynamic storm system. The most tornadoes occurred across the Deep South as the system moved into Mississippi and Alabama on Monday, April 28th. Supercell thunderstorms developed during the afternoon over eastern Mississippi and northwest Alabama in the warm sector well ahead of a cold front. The activity slowly spread east and southeast overnight, with this wave of severe storms ending early Tuesday morning. Storms redeveloped late Tuesday afternoon and moved into Central Alabama. A large area of rainfall across the northern Gulf Coast limited the amount of instability across the area, and storms remained below severe limits. The last wave of severe weather occurred early Wednesday morning across the south as an isolated storm produced large hail, as the system finally pulled east of the area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado strengthened as it moved into southeast Blount County, near Golden Lake, and tracked along County Road 24. Some of the most extensive damage occurred just north of Pine Mountain Road, where winds were estimated at 130 mph. At this location, a home that was under construction but almost completely finished, was swept off its foundation and thrown about 50 yards into a lake. A small utility trailer was also thrown about 25 to 50 yards. Dozens of trees were either snapped or uprooted as well. The tornado tracked northeast, parallel to Inland Lake, snapping and uprooting thousands of trees and causing significant damage to two homes on Pine Mountain Rd near Cut Off Rd. A single wide and double wide manufactured home were completely destroyed on Dumas Bridge Road, and at this location there were two injuries. The tornado continued northeastward and crossed Highland Lake with a width of 1000 yds, snapping or uprooting every tree in its path. On the shores of the lake, several homes received major damage directly from tornadic winds. On Echo Lane, a well-built single family home had its roof completely removed, while 2-by-6 exterior walls remained standing, and non-load bearing walls were buckled. The neighboring home also had its roof torn off with some exterior walls collapsed. A three story home across the slough had major structural damage and was partially shifted off its foundation. Along the north shore of Highland Lake, the tornado continued  snapping and uprooting trees, and damaging several more homes. The tornado  weaken slightly as it crossed County Road 29 and Rogers Rd, with tree damage becoming more sporadic. However, several homes sustained significant damage in these locations.

This outbreak started across the Central Plains on the 27th and slowly migrated eastward over the following two days. A large tornado outbreak occurred across the Lower MS River & TN River Valleys on the 28th. The event was capped on the 30th with additional severe weather and a historic flash flooding/heavy rain event along the AL, FL gulf coast where rainfall totals peaked between 15-25 inches!||Across the NWS Jackson, MS forecast area, the tornado outbreak on the 28th was the main event. This event was driven by a classic severe weather pattern with a strong fast moving jet stream and a deep surface cyclone over the central plains. These features helped to produce strong wind shear in the atmosphere which in turn combined with rich gulf moisture and setup a volatile atmospheric mix. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed during the afternoon/evening and produced many instances of damaging wind and large hail along with multiple tornadoes. The most devastating tornado was the EF-4 which tore a path across NE Leake, the corners of Attala/Neshoba counties, and through the heart of Winston County where the city of Louisville was especially hard hit. This tornado was on ground for 34.3 miles and resulted in 10 fatalities and many injuries. Other hard hit counties were Lowndes, Rankin, Hinds, Scott, Newton, Montgomery, Warren and Jones. Each of these counties experienced at least one tornado, some multiple tornadoes. Overall, 21 tornadoes were confirmed across the forecast area. Of these tornadoes, 3 were rated EF-3, 3 rated EF-2, 12 rated EF1 and 2 rated EF-0.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado first touched down in northeastern Leake County, where the damage was mostly downed trees. As the tornado approached the 4 corners intersection of Leake, Attala, Neshoba, and Winston Counties, it strengthened and began to impact structures. Several mobile homes, medal buildings and single family homes were damaged or destroyed in this area along Highway 25. The tornado continued northeast impacting rural areas of southwest Winston County. There it intensified and began to produce EF3 and some areas of EF4 damage. Numerous homes were destroyed, trees were debarked and severe damage occurred to several chicken farms. The EF4 damage in this area was a building reduced to a slab and a chicken farm that was completely wiped away.||At this point, the tornado made a turn to a more northerly course and continued to cause EF2 and EF3 damage just south of Louisville. The tornado entered the city of Louisville on the south side along Highway 15 and continued north-northeast through the east side of the city. Widespread EF3 and EF4 damage occurred in this area. Of particular note, several industrial buildings were destroyed and an area of homes and apartments was destroyed, a few of them being completely taken down to the slab.||The tornado continued through the east side of Louisville causing mainly EF3 damage. Of particular note, the Winston Medical Center received heavy damage and became incapable of use. The tornado continued moving north-northeast roughly along McCullough Road causing EF3 and EF4 damage. Numerous homes had their roofs and walls removed and some were reduced to slabs. Near the intersection with Louisville-Brooksville Road, two particularly well built homes were very heavily damaged and received EF4 ratings.||From this point, the tornado began to weaken, causing mainly EF2 and EF3 damage along North Columbus Avenue.

The storms moved slowly, while multiple storms moved over some of the same areas repeatedly. The result was extreme rainfall rates that produced 3 to 6 inches of rain in only a couple of hours.

The flooding initially began on the east side of the city in the Haywood Rd/downtown airport area, where several cars were stalled in deep, rushing water due to an overflowing culvert on Byrdland Dr (3 E Downtown). A 39-year-old man and 36-year-old woman who abandoned their vehicles to seek higher ground drowned after being swept into the fast-moving water and nearby culvert which drained into Laurel Creek. A tributary of Richland Creek flooded several dozen apartment homes along Villa Rd between Pleasantburg Dr and Pelham Rd (2.5 ENE Downtown). The most severe flooding occurred on the east side of downtown, near the Stone Ave/I-385 intersection, due to a combination of Richland Creek overflowing its banks by several feet and major urban flooding. Multiple vehicles were stalled in high water in this area. The high water caused a gas leak and explosion at a restaurant on Stone Ave, causing significant damage to the exterior of the building. Richland Creek and the Reedy River overflowed their banks and flooded much of Cleveland Park, which remained closed for two days. This was the worst flooding along this portion of the Reedy in almost 10 years. Additionally, a small tributary of Langston Creek flooded the intersection of Langston Dr and Highway 276 (3 NNW Downtown). Finally, Rocky Creek, or a culvert draining into Rocky Creek overflowed along I-85 near the Pelham Rd exit (7 E Downtown), sending water over the southbound lane and forcing closure of the interstate for several hours.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This continued through the day as heavy rain fell over some already saturated ground. During the late afternoon and evening hours of the 6th, the stalled front started to move slowly north as a warm front. This occurred as a surface low developed across the Texas coast and began to track northeast. This was able to bring mid 60 degree dew points into the region to just north of the Highway 84 corridor and allow for storms to become more surface based which brought a threat for damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes.||The most significant impact from this weather system was from the prolonged heavy rainfall. Rainfall totals ranged from a widespread 2-4 inches with a few swaths of 5 to 7 inches. This sort of rainfall produced many instances of flash flooding along with significant river flooding after the rains ended. Multiple roads were washed out in some locations from the copious amounts of rain that fell along with many other roads covered with water. The Strong River at D'Lo, in Simpson County, crested at a record flood stage of 34.3 feet. Due to its close proximity to U.S. Highway 49, flood waters crept across the road and forced closure for a few days.

The activity on the 2nd consisted of elevated thunderstorms with lightning along the coast during the morning and a few thunderstorms over the San Bernardino County mountains. Rain and rapid cooling in one of these storms resulted in several bicyclists being treated for hypothermia during the Tour de Big Bear race. This elevated convection became intense and transitioned into numerous strong thunderstorms on the 3rd, focusing more on the mountains and deserts and closing several roadways due to flooding. Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches occurred in less than 3 hours across steep terrain in the San Bernardino County mountains. The hardest hit areas were Mt Baldy, Forest Falls and Oak Glen where numerous debris flows occurred causing road damage and closures. Incident Command Posts were set up at both Mt Baldy and Valley of the Falls. A weather station in Mt Baldy reported 4 inches of rain in less than 2 hours. Swift water rescues were performed in Mt Baldy along the LA County line. There was also a large area of 1 to 2.5 inches of rain in low-lying areas and deserts, including 2.73 inches in one hour at the Borrego ALERT gage. The Fish Creek RAWS in the San Diego County desert recorded 2.77 inches of rain in one hour, resulting in moderate flooding and the subsequent closure of Fish Creek Road through August 8th. Heavy rain west of the mountains produced flash flooding in Redlands and Ramona. A large sink hole developed in Redland due to heavy rainfall. San Bernardino County was the hardest hit with flash flooding, with 25 homes damaged and approximately $11 million in damage county-wide for this event. Full storm surveys were done from Mill Creek near Forest Falls, to Oak Glen, to Lytle Creek and through out Mt Baldy on August 4th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> CHP reported a flooded wash with multiple cars stuck in the area.  4 inches of rain recorded in gauge within 2 hours on the steep slope of big Mt Baldy. A hiker parked their car in the small town of Mt Baldy and hiked to the top. Hail and lightning caused them to go back down the mountain early. They used the dry creek to go back|down and were swept away in a flash flood over 10 feet, per NWS Storm Survey of high water marks on trees. The hiker's car was found the next|day during the NWS Storm Survey. The car was destroyed and the person drowned somewhere along the middle or bottom of the creek, just on the San Bernardino County side. LA County Fire department led the search and rescue. Since Mt Baldy|town, where the car was parked, is in San Bernardino County they ended up having a unified command with Los Angeles County, San Bernardino Fire, and Town of|Mt Baldy.  At least 2 vehicles were towed out of the creek. We were told at the survey that the cars were on the Los Angeles County side of the mountain but washed downstream, and across the San Bernardino County side of the mountain, where the one fatality of a 48-yr old man from El Segundo, occurred.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Behind the cold front, gusty winds developed over the mountains and deserts on the 19th. The winds began during the early morning hours, with a gust to 60 mph at Bear Peak in Tulare County, and a gust to 53 mph at Mojave, during the pre-dawn hours. Winds gusted over 45 mph in the eastern Kern County desert during the morning and early afternoon of the 19th, and gusts to 50 mph were recorded in the Piutes.||An upper-level ridge of high pressure returned to California on the 19th behind the departing low-pressure system. High temperatures warmed to above normal for the next several days before the next storm arrived during the afternoon of February 26th. This warming trend peaked with Bakersfield hitting 81 degrees on the 25th, and Fresno reaching 80 degrees. This was the first time either city had seen 80 degrees since November 10th, 2013.||The storm that reached the central California interior on February 26th was the first of two closely-spaced systems. Together, the two storms brought as much as 4 inches of rain to the Southern Sierra Nevada foothills, and over an inch of rain to the Kern County deserts. Fresno had a three-day storm total of 1.11 inch, bringing the total rainfall for February to 2.11 inch. This was 0.08 inch greater than the normal of 2.03 inches and was the first time since December 2012 that Fresno had above-normal rainfall for a month.||The south end of the San Joaquin Valley was rain-shadowed, with Bakersfield receiving only 0.28 inch of rain, almost all of which fell from the second storm on February 28th. The second storm was located off the central California coast, and was impressive on satellite pictures with a tightly-wound structure and a clear center much like the eye of a tropical system. The circulation around the storm produced a southerly wind over the Tehachapi Mountains which funneled through Tejon Pass and down the Grapevine into the south end of the San Joaquin Valley. Winds gusted as high as 89 mph at Grapevine Peak, and to 50 mph at Sunflower Valley on the west side of the Valley. At Buck Rock, in the Sierra Nevada in Tulare County, winds gusted to 66 mph.|Several thunderstorms were spawned by the storms, with the second system being the most potent. Numerous trees were toppled in both the San Joaquin Valley and the Sierra foothills by winds, in many cases pulling down power lines. One thunderstorm at Squaw Valley in the foothills produced a gust estimated at 65 mph, which toppled trees and damaged the roof of a garage. On the Valley floor, there were reports of houses and parked vehicles damaged by falling trees or large limbs. Near Fresno, a tree 3 feet in diameter was toppled.||Street flooding was reported at several locations, not only in the San Joaquin Valley but also in eastern Kern County where the Garlock Road flooded. (Garlock Road is prone to flooding from runoff from the El Paso Mountains.). In Dinuba, water covering the road was estimated at 8 to 12 inches deep. ||In the Southern Sierra Nevada, estimates of new snowfalls were as high as four feet. (These were Snotel observations; a post-storm snow survey had not been conducted at the time of this summary.)||February 2014 was much warmer than normal, and was Fresno���s warmest February on record. Bakersfield tied for its 6th warmest February on record.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Lightning caused an injury to a man who was in an oil field near Fresno.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

For example, the Tri State Airport near Huntington had a gust to 51 mph at 1909E, a spotter near Leon had a 45 mph gust around 1955E, and Charleston had a 46 mph gust near 2030E.  A few spots received slightly stronger wind gusts.  Electrical power outages occurred.  Cabell County and the Huntington vicinity had about 16,000 customers without electricity.       ||After an overnight and morning lull, more rounds of convection developed during midday on the 11th in southwest Virginia and southern West Virginia.  Those showers and thunderstorms moved northeast through portions of West Virginia during the afternoon.||Additional clusters of showers and thunderstorms moved northeast through West Virginia during the overnight hours of the 11th into the 12th.

A line of thunderstorms formed ahead of the cold front by late afternoon and moved east across the state through the evening hours.  Hail with the storms was generally quite small.  One inch diameter hail fell in Crawford County in Dow City.  The primary severe events from this system were high winds that occurred as the MCS progressed across the state.  Several locations reported gusts of 60 MPH or higher.  An 80 MPH gust was reported in Guthrie County at Yale and Bayard.  A 71 MPH wind gust occurred in Marion County.  Heavy rainfall was also of significance with flash flooding in Crawford County.  This was caused by a dam failure which flooded Highway 39.  Three inches of rain fell in 50 minutes in Dallas County.  There were numerous reports of around 2 inches of rain falling in Boone and Polk Counties.  Water ponding and low-land flooding was common.  One person was struck by lightning at the Denison Airport.  The person received minor injuries. Funnel clouds were sighted in both Crawford and Boone Counties.

Thunderstorms developed over Iowa during the early afternoon and organized into a forward-propagating quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) and tracked to southern Lake Michigan by early to mid evening. Meanwhile, a second complex of intense thunderstorms developed over central and eastern Iowa and also evolved into a QLCS, tracking across northern Illinois and northwest Indiana late in the evening into the overnight hours. ||Across northern Illinois and northwest Indiana, the first derecho event produced scattered straight-line wind damage, with gusts measured as high as 70 MPH.  The second derecho produced far more extensive damage, with 80 to 90 MPH straight line winds and numerous tornadoes.  Initial post-event surveys cataloged 18 tornadoes across northern Illinois and northwest Indiana, 17 of EF1 intensity and one of EF0 intensity.  Of these 18 tornadoes, 14 were associated with a pair of large mesovortices that traveled along the Kankakee River Valley in Kankakee County, Illinois and Lake, Newton, and Jasper Counties in Indiana.  ||Analysis of Google Earth satellite imagery gathered in spring of 2015 showed numerous additional areas of damage not documented in the original survey efforts.  A thorough analysis of this imagery and synthesis with the original survey information led to a complete reanalysis of the Kankakee Valley tornadoes.  Ultimately, 18 tornado tracks were identified alone in the Kankakee Valley, leading to a total of 22 tornadoes for northern Illinois and northwest Indiana. Of the 18 revised tornadoes, 16 of the paths were determined, in part, using satellite imagery. Further re-examination of the damage also led to a change in rating for several of the damage locations. Of the 18 reanalyzed Kankakee Valley tracks, two were rated EF2, 13 were rated EF1, and three were rated EF0. Additional details on this reanalysis, including the methods used, can be found in the Electronic Journal of Severe Storms Meteorology (Lyza et al. 2019, ���A Multi-Platform Reanalysis of the Kankakee Valley Tornado Cluster on 30 June 2014���).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A home on the 15700 block of Peggy Lane was struck by lightning sparking a fire.
