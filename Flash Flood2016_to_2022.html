Widespread heavy rain developed on October 8th and continued through early on October 9th as Matthew approached and moved offshore of the coast. Rainfall ranged from 2 to 4 inches on the southern beaches to 8 to 12 inches inland. This rain led to significant flash flooding over  much of eastern North Carolina during the afternoon of October 8th through the morning of October 9th. Many roads were washed out and impassable for days from the serious flash flooding. Devastating river flooding then occurred several days after Matthew as most main-stem rivers exceeded major flood levels. Strong winds of 40 to 60 mph inland and 60 to 80 mph along the coast occurred as Matthew passed offshore mainly during the evening of October 8th through the morning of the 9th. These winds led to numerous downed trees and power lines across the region with widespread power outages that lasted several days in some areas. Storm surge inundation was mainly 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the coast, however inundation of 3 to 5 feet above ground level was observed on the sound side of the Outer Banks. ||There were six confirmed fatalities across the area with five in Lenoir County and one in Pitt County. Dollar damages totals have not been completed but will likely exceed 200 million dollars with significant agricultural losses.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Car drove into severe flooding near Mozingo Road near V A O site C road.

However, widespread heavy rainfall was relentless along and ahead of the surface front over Deep East Texas, all of North Louisiana, Southwest Arkansas and extreme Southeast Oklahoma where widespread flash flooding occurred. In McCurtain County, a flash flood fatality occurred when a driver drove through flood waters south of Broken Bow.

However, widespread heavy rainfall was relentless along and ahead of the surface front over Deep East Texas, all of North Louisiana, and Southwest Arkansas where widespread flash flooding occurred. Widespread rainfall amounts of 12-18 inches fell during the 4 day period across Deep East Texas and all of North Louisiana, with amounts in excess of 24 inches across Ouachita Parish. This flooding was of epic proportions across the entire northern half of the state, something the Emergency Management community said they have never experienced before.  Thousands of structures suffered some sort of water damage along with thousands of road surfaces as well.  Many road surfaces, bridges and low water crossings were completely washed out.  This resulted in many high water rescues of stranded motorists, especially during the very beginnings of the prolonged flooding event.  Many motorists drove around barricades and into the flooded roadways.  The flash flooding event very quickly transitioned into a historic hydrologic event as several rivers, lakes and bayous suffered major flooding conditions with many reaching record crests.  This of course resulted in a daily watch of numerous levees and dams for North Louisiana's waterways with numerous subdivisions built in the vicinity of these waterways.  The Louisiana National Guard was dispatched by the Governor of Louisiana to help respond to the needs of citizens of North Louisiana which included evacuation assistance, rescues by vehicle, boat and helicopter, distribution and supply of water, security and shelter support and distribution of sandbags.  Numerous shelters were opened by the Louisiana Red Cross and by local churches across the northern half of the state as well to shelter residents effected by the flood.

Meanwhile, a weak frontal boundary entered the region from the west on the 8th, and became stationary over Deep East Texas, Northwest Louisiana, and Southwest Arkansas. Upper level disturbances ejected northeast ahead of the Northern Mexico low pressure system, resulting in periods of showers and thunderstorms containing heavy rainfall to move repeatedly over these areas. The air mass was most unstable on the 8th, where several severe thunderstorms developed and produced wind damage across portions of Northwest and North Central Louisiana, as well as East Texas. However, widespread heavy rainfall was relentless along and ahead of the surface front over Deep East Texas, all of North Louisiana, and Southwest Arkansas where widespread flash flooding occurred. Widespread rainfall amounts of 12-18 inches fell during the 4 day period across Deep East Texas and all of North Louisiana, with amounts in excess of 24 inches across Ouachita Parish. This flooding was of epic proportions across the entire northern half of the state, something the Emergency Management community said they have never experienced before.  Thousands of structures suffered some sort of water damage along with thousands of road surfaces as well.  Many road surfaces, bridges and low water crossings were completely washed out.  This resulted in many high water rescues of stranded motorists, especially during the very beginnings of the prolonged flooding event.  Many motorists drove around barricades and into the flooded roadways.  The flash flooding event very quickly transitioned into a historic hydrologic event as several rivers, lakes and bayous suffered major flooding conditions with many reaching record crests.  This of course resulted in a daily watch of numerous levees and dams for North Louisiana's waterways with numerous subdivisions built in the vicinity of these waterways.  The Louisiana National Guard was dispatched by the Governor of Louisiana to help respond to the needs of citizens of North Louisiana which included evacuation assistance, rescues by vehicle, boat and helicopter, distribution and supply of water, security and shelter support and distribution of sandbags.  Numerous shelters were opened by the Louisiana Red Cross and by local churches across the northern half of the state as well to shelter residents effected by the flood.  A Federal Disaster Declaration was approved for Bienville, Bossier, Caddo, Caldwell, Claiborne, De Soto, Grant, Jackson, La Salle, Lincoln, Natchitoches, Ouachita, Red River, Sabine, Union, Webster and Winn Parishes.  Some of the more impressive 5-Day rainfall totals were as follows:  Monroe 3.2 SSE:  26.96, Taylortown: 20.39, Rocky Branch 1.3 W: 20.29, Barksdale AFB: 19.09, Minden: 18.73 Ruston 5.5 NW:  18.02, Hodges Gardens: 17.90, Natchitoches: 16.86, Jamestown: 16.85, Caney RAWS: 16.08, Gum Springs RAWS: 15.52, Quitman: 15.50, Stonewall: 15.42, South Southern Hills: 14.88, Columbia 4.1 NNW: 14.77, Coushatta 1.4 E: 14.21, Jena: 11.27, Catahoula RAWS: 8.69.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 22 year old male drowned when the vehicle he was driving was swept off the road by floodwaters.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

There were 15 fatalities in Greenbrier County and widespread catastrophic damage across much of the county. Summers and Monroe counties had much less severe flash flooding. ||The two days prior to the event were quite wet as several rounds of thunderstorms traversed the area with rainfall of roughly 1 to 2 inches across much of Greenbrier County in the 48 hours ending at 0800 EDT on June 23rd. This left the ground quite moist and primed for more efficient runoff.  The synoptic setup for this event featured an upper level ridge over the central U.S. northwest flow across the eastern U.S. Several strong short-waves topped the ridge and dropped southeast across the Ohio Valley toward the central Appalachians with the strongest wave approaching on the morning of the 23rd of June. Satellite imagery showed a deep tap of tropical moisture into West Virginia and a strengthening upper level jet providing additional lift. A warm front was located just north of the area and became a focus for convection in the early morning hours of the 23rd. Up to an inch of rain had fallen across Summers and Greenbrier by 730 AM EDT. Late in the morning, renewed convection from the west entered the area. During the late morning to early afternoon convection continued to train across the same general area of southeast WV and far western VA with hourly rainfall rates of 1.50 to 2. One of the more reliable automated rain gauges at White Sulphur Springs, WV (SUPW2) measured 2.32 and 1.89 in consecutive hours from 1 to 3 PM EDT or 4.21 in 2 hours. The 2-hour, 1000-year ARI at this location per NOAA Atlas 14 is 3.88��� giving an indication of the intensity of the rain.   Toward the end of this time window is when intense flash flooding began across eastern parts of the county but earlier in the far west. Flash Flood Warnings (FFWs) were issued throughout the morning and afternoon and a rare Flash Flood Warning Emergency product was issued  for Greenbrier County by the NWS at 441 PM EDT as the extent of the disaster became apparent. ||Radar and rain gauge measurements showed as much as 8 to 10 inches (perhaps higher locally) fell in a band across central Greenbrier County. The bulk of the rain fell in less than 12 hours between 600 AM and 600 PM. The top five official rain gauge totals (24-hour amounts ending at 8 AM EDT, June 24th) included White Sulphur Springs COOP (WSUW2) 8.29, Lewisburg 3N COOP (LWBW2) 8.00, White Sulphur Springs DCP (SUPW2) 7.83, McCross 3E COOP (MCRW2) 6.54 and Williamsburg VFD IFLOWS (WMBW2) 5.37.  One personal weather station at Maxwelton measured 9.37 and there were several anecdotal reports of 10 or more inches. The 24-hour rainfall at White Sulphur Springs COOP, with fairly complete data back to around 1920 (and sporadic  back to 1888) was more than double the all-time daily record (4.00��� set in March, 1890). Lewisburg 3N COOP with data all the way back to around 1900 also demolished its all-time daily record of 4.06��� set in July, 1954. A point event analysis by the Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center (HDSC) indicated that the rainfall was in the .001 Annual Exceedance Probability (1,000 year Annual Recurrence Interval, or ARI) for a 24-hour period.||The gauged hydrologic response was astounding as small creeks fed rivers that rose almost like a flash flood. An IFLOWS river gage at Ronceverte (RONW2) on the Greenbrier River rose to flood stage of 15 feet by around 730 PM EDT and climbed another 8.2 feet by 1130 PM. The NWS forecast point on Greenbrier River at Alderson (ALDW2) rose very slowly through the afternoon of the 23rd but around 700 PM EDT massive runoff began reaching the USGS gage location. The river rose from just over 4 feet (discharge of 2,300 cfs or cubic ft. per second) at 700 PM to reach flood stage of 14 feet (40,000 cfs) just 2.5 hours later around 930 PM. The river continued an astronomical rate of rise reaching Major Flood Stage (19 feet, 63,000 cfs) by midnight June 24th, before cresting at 22 feet (80,700 cfs) at 430 AM EDT. This was the 3rd highest crest on record (data back to 1895) at Alderson, surpassed only by the January 1996 rain/snowmelt flood and November 1985 flood. According to the latest available USGS report on flood frequency for West Virginia streams the discharge at the Alderson gage was very close to the 0.01 Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) or 100-year annual recurrence interval. A similar extreme response occurred on the Greenbrier River at the Hilldale USGS gage (HLLW2) downstream of Alderson just above the confluence with the New River. It also had its 3rd highest crest (25.45 feet, Flood Stage 16 ft) and discharge (82,508 cfs) on record (data back to 1936) and was also very close to the .01 AEP or 100-year event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Unprecedented flash flooding occurred across large parts of Greenbrier County but especially in a swath across the central part of the county where an estimated 6 to 10 inches of rain fell in less than 12 hours. The first flood-related report was received at 100 PM EDT (1200 PM EST) as a portion of Highway 20 in western Greenbrier County became impassable south of Quinwood due to a mudslide and debris in the road. By 130 PM (1230 EST) there were several reports of flash flooding in the community of Rupert which required the evacuation of a nursing home and a vehicle rescue. Portions of Route 60 were closed between Rainelle and Rupert and severe flash flooding occurred along Big Clear Creek, a tributary of the Meadow River just north of Rupert. A number of homes of homes were badly damaged or destroyed along Big Clear Creek and several water rescues required in the Rupert area. The first flooding reports out of Rainelle in far western Greenbrier County were received at 155 PM (1255 EDT) and described people being trapped in cars and numerous water rescues. Several creeks emerge from the higher terrain surrounding Rainelle and converge in or near the town (Wolfpen Creek, Boggs Creek, Little Sewell Creek), the largest of which is Sewell Creek which then joins the Meadow River just northeast of town. The IFLOWS gage on the Meadow River near Hines (HNEW2) rose rapidly above its Flood Stage of 14 feet by 200 PM EDT and reached Major Flood Stage of 18 feet just two hours later, shortly before it ceased functioning at a stage of 18.8 feet while still rising. Flooding along the Meadow River was extensive with numerous homes and businesses affected. In addition, the rising Meadow River prevented Sewell Creek in Rainelle from discharging into the Meadow River which likely contributed to the rapidly rising water levels in Rainelle. Flooding was catastrophic in the town with water up to 8 feet deep or more and numerous homes flooded. There were four fatalities in Rainelle and three in Rupert, all due to asphyxiation (drowning). ||Meanwhile, numerous flood reports continued to be received although the 911 center and Emergency Management were completely overwhelmed with calls. The Greenbrier County Sheriff described 'complete chaos' across the county in a media report as dozens of roads were closed, damaged or destroyed and many water rescues were made from cars and structures. Especially hard hit was the White Sulphur Springs area in the eastern part of the county. Several small streams also descend rapidly from higher surrounding terrain and converge in or near White Sulphur Springs including Dry Creek and Wades Creek which join Howard Creek in the town, which itself is a large tributary of the Greenbrier River. All were transformed into raging torrents which tore through parts of the town taking trees, cars and even homes downstream. One of the more horrifying images was of a burning home being carried downstream on Howard Creek before colliding with a bridge. This creek runs through portions of the famous Greenbrier Resort and images of the normally tranquil stream converted into a massive river covering portions of the golf course were widely shared on social and conventional media. Howard Creek flooded long stretches of U.S. Highway 60 downstream of White Sulphur Springs, causing severe damage all along the way to its confluence with the Greenbrier River at Caldwell, six miles downstream. Parts of Route 60 were essentially destroyed and probably dozens of cars were swept into the creek and deposited along the way. There were seven fatalities in and around the White Sulphur Springs area, all but one from drowning. One person's body was found some 30 miles downstream on the Greenbrier River from where she was believed to have been swept into a creek that feeds the river. The body of a teenage girl from White Sulphur Springs was not found for over 6 weeks, eventually winding up in the Caldwell area on the Greenbrier River. There was significant flooding all along the Greenbrier River with Caldwell, Ronceverte and Alderson the hardest hit as the river rose at near flash-flood rates and crested in the Major Flood category (see Episode for details). Numerous homes were flooded in the town of Alderson (Pop: 1184), according to the Mayor. A state of emergency was declared for a number of counties in West Virginia during and after the event and a Major Federal Disaster for over  dozen counties was declared on June 25, 2016 by the President of the U.S. Fatalities in the county totaled 15 with an unknown number of injuries. There was over $5.5 million in public road/bridge damage in Greenbrier County and substantial damage to private roads and bridges. Preliminary data showed 319 homes destroyed and 353 damaged across the county, mostly in the Rainelle and White Sulphur Springs areas. In addition, 12 businesses were destroyed and 20 damaged along with numerous motor vehicles destroyed. Final damage totals for the event are not available from Emergency Management officials as of this writing but an estimate $40 million may not be unreasonable.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The result was historic flooding; widespread flash flooding, and an extended period of major to record river flooding. Matthew's flooding rains, surge and wind brought loss of life, displaced tens of thousands of people, and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in structural damage as homes and businesses were devastated or totally destroyed.

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ���It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn���t go back.���||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged. In the worst cases, sections of road bed were washed away.  Public bridges and small private bridges were damaged or destroyed. Large debris piles collected against bridges. Countless vehicles were flooded.  Electricity and water were lost for days in the hardest hit flood areas.         ||The American Red Cross had over 800 workers helping at its peak.  They distributed over 7,500 cleanup kits and over 100,000 meals and snacks.  Many church based organizations and ordinary individual citizens volunteered their time and services to help in the flood recovery.  Nationally known celebrities and sport figures, with ties to West Virginia, also helped to raise awareness and increase donations for flood recovery.||The state transportation secretary estimated 8 million dollars in damage to roads in Clay County, 8 million dollars in Nicholas, over 13 million in Kanawha County.||Several schools were severely damaged by flood waters. This included in Clay County, White Elementary and the county bus garage. In Kanawha County, Herbert Hoover High School, Clendenin Elementary, Elk Valley Christian School, plus Bridge Elementary Schools were severely damaged.  Water from the Elk River crested about 7 feet deep in the first flood at Herbert Hoover High School. In Nicholas County. Richwood High and Middle School was severely damaged.  Moderate flood damage occurred to Clay High School and Elkview Middle School.  Minor flood damage occurred at Middle Birch Elementary School in Braxton County.  Minor flood damage also was seen in Ansted Elementary in Fayette County and Glade Elementary in Webster County.||A state of emergency was declared by Governor Tomblin.  At its peak deployment, around 650 members of the West Virginia Army National Guard and West Virginia Air National Guard were activated.  Major tasks assigned to the guard troops included delivering supplies to residents with no road access, and removal of flood debris.  Private contractors were also used for debris removal. In just Kanawha County, 15,000 tons of flood debris were collected.       ||A federal disaster was quickly declared by President Obama.  At least 8 counties were eligible from the events of June 23rd and 24th within the forecast area of the National Weather Service in Charleston. They included Jackson, Roane, Kanawha, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties.  See FEMA disaster number 4273-DR for more information.  Over 4900 individuals applied for federal assistance from those 8 counties, totaling over 20 million dollars.  Public assistance for debris removal, emergency protective services, roads, bridges, and schools, was over 50 million dollar in those same 8 counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flash flooding occurred in scattered locations, mostly in the northern half of the county.  In Ravenswood, a small stream along Utah Road called Lick Run is usually ankle deep. It rose 6 feet. A 4 year old toddler slipped into the water. The grandfather jumped in, but could not rescue him. His body was found the following day, about a quarter mile away. ||A preliminary damage assessment was done in this county.  It had 10 homes destroyed and about 2 dozen with damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Satellite imagery showed a deep tap of tropical moisture into West Virginia and a strengthening upper level jet providing additional lift. A warm front was located just north of the area and became a focus for convection in the early morning hours of the 23rd. During the late morning to early afternoon convection continued to train across the same general area of southeast WV and far western VA with hourly rainfall rates of 1.50 to 2 for several hours.||Radar and rain gauge measurements showed as much as 4 to 8 inches (perhaps higher locally) fell in a band across central Alleghany County. The bulk of the rain fell in less than 12 hours between 600 AM and 600 PM EDT. The Governor of Virginia declared a state of emergency in the City of Covington and Alleghany County.||The phenomenal runoff from creeks, streams and overland flow produced an extreme hydrologic response on larger rivers including the Jackson River. The river gage at Covington (CVGV2) rose over 10 feet in 5 hours to reach Flood Stage (17 feet) for the first time since September 2004 (during the remains of Hurricane Jeanne).  A River Flood Warning (FLW) was issued at 609 PM as the river was near 15 feet and the crest was only 4.5 hours later at 22.33 feet just below the Major Flood Stage of 23 feet. This was highest stage reached at the Covington gage since the November 1985 flood (23.31 feet) and 2nd highest since the construction of Gathright Dam in 1979. Gathright Dam was built to reduce flooding on the Jackson River but so much rain fell in the watershed below the dam that flooding still occurred at Covington. Numerous homes and several businesses in Covington suffered severe flood damage from the Jackson River.  At the same time Dunlap Creek (DLPV2), which drains 162 mi2 of western Alleghany County and empties into the Jackson River in Covington was also rising at an extreme rate, climbing from a stage of around 3 feet (445 cfs) at 200 PM to a record stage of 16.49 feet (30,300 cfs) in a little over 6 hours.  The previous record at this gage was 15.65 feet (27,400 cfs) set in June 1972 with the remains of Hurricane Agnes. Hydrological peak stage records at this gage date back to 1929. According to USGS flood frequency reports this flood was likely in excess of a 200-year (0.005 AEP) event on Dunlap Creek. There was extensive flooding along Dunlap Creek with roads and homes flooded and some requiring evacuations. Flooding continued downstream and a few hours later a River Flood Warning was issued for the upper James River including the forecast points at Lick Run (LIRV2) and Buchanan (BNNV2) both of which easily reached flood stage. At Lick Run the crest of 22.84 feet was the 10th highest on record (continuous records since 1925) and the highest since January 1996 (25.03 feet).  Per USGS data the 48,000 cfs discharge at Lick Run was roughly a 10-year (.10 AEP) flood event. At Buchanan the 42,900 cfs was merely somewhere between a 2- to 5-year event (0.5 to 0.2 AEP).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flash flooding was first reported in Alleghany County at 215 PM EDT (115 PM EST) as Indian Draft Road (Route 600) was closed. Numerous additional reports and social media reports continued to be received through the afternoon. Numerous small streams flooded including Wilson Creek which overflowed Route 629 (Douthat Park Road). The most serious flooding was along Dunlap Creek with runs through the southwestern portions of the county joining the Jackson River just north of Covington. More than 25 homes were badly damaged in the county most of them along Dunlap Creek which set a new flood of record (see Episode for details). Water was reported over Route 60 from Dunlap Creek in several areas. Two water rescues by boat were performed and several landslides were reported including one that was reported to have closed Pitzer Ridge Road (Route 657) east of Route 18. Three Botetourt County firefighters were injured during flood rescue operations.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 6.10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Another person drowned south of Viroqua (Vernon County) when the driver of a truck pulling a cattle trailer attempted to drive through flood waters during the afternoon or evening of the 22nd. The truck and trailer became stuck in the flood waters, which filled the passenger compartment of the truck. The flooding occurred as several rounds of thunderstorms with heavy rain moved across southwest Wisconsin from the morning of September 21st into the morning of the 22nd. The heavy rain resulted in flash flooding across portions of Adams, Clark, Crawford, La Crosse, Monroe, Richland, Vernon and Trempealeau Counties. A train derailed near Ferryville (Crawford County) when the roadbed was washed away by flooding. Around 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled into the water from one of the locomotives. Two people had to be rescued near De Soto (Vernon County) and another in Sidie Hollow County Park southwest of Viroqua (Vernon County). Washouts and road closures occurred in Trempealeau, La Crosse, Vernon and Crawford Counties. In Vernon County alone, high water and flooding resulted in 90 road closures and 44 homes and business were destroyed. Public and private sector damages in Vernon County totaled almost $10 million. In Crawford County, 2 homes were destroyed with another 67 damaged with public and private sector damages totaling almost $5 million. Flooding on the Black River in Black River Falls (Jackson County) caused the hydroelectric dam to loose a gate when a large tree traveled over the dam. Several boats and docks that broke loose in Lake Arbutus also traveled over the dam. A state of emergency was declared in Clark, Crawford, Jackson and Vernon Counties. The Governor of Wisconsin declared a state of emergency for Adams, Clark, Crawford, Jackson, La Crosse, Monroe, Richland, Trempealeau and Vernon Counties. A federal disaster declaration was made for Adams, Clark, Crawford, Jackson, Juneau, La Crosse, Monroe and Vernon Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rain caused flash flooding to occur across much of Vernon County. One person was killed near Victory when a mudslide caused a home to slide down a hillside very early in the morning of the 22nd. Numerous other houses were damaged by rocks, debris and floodwaters in Victory when a culvert used to divert water around town became blocked. In and around De Soto, two people had to be rescued from flood waters and 15 people were evacuated from a trailer park. The flood waters also covered State Highway 35. Flooding along Coe Hollow Creek prompted officials to evacuate Sidie Hollow Park but not before one person had to be rescued. Flood waters from the Kickapoo River flooded the west side of La Farge and caused State Highway 131 to be closed both north and south of town. Flooding from the Kickapoo River also sent water spilling into Viola and Readstown. State Highway 82 was closed west of La Farge because of flood waters from Otter Creek. Street flooding occurred in Viroqua where the water was up to 4 feet deep on Main Street. A state of emergency was declared in the county and there were up to 90 roads closed due to flooding.

The main impact from these storms was flash flooding over Cheyenne, Decatur, Norton, and Graham counties where estimated rainfall amounts of up to ten inches fell.  Many roads in northern Cheyenne County had washouts three to four feet deep, with a few washouts eight to twelve feet deep.  Road crews had to remove silt off Highway 36 west of Bird City where water flowed over the road.  The worst of the flooding was over southern Norton and northern Graham counties where numerous roads were washed out and Lenora was flooded.  The flash flooding transitioned to flooding during the overnight hours as the moderate to heavy rainfall moved to the east.  Swift water rescues were conducted in southern Norton County.

One of these rescues involved a couple who under estimated the depth of the water over the highway and drove through the flood waters on Highway 9.  The vehicle was washed off the road and caught in a tree.  The couple escaped from the vehicle and climbed into the tree, remaining there until rescuers arrived.  There was one direct fatality from the flooding.  The individual was driving north from Graham County on county roads toward Lenora.  He drove into flood waters, under estimating their depth.  His vehicle was washed off the road.  His body was found a quarter mile away from the vehicle.  In general, the majority of the rainfall fell south of CR W.  Rainfall amounts of five to seven inches were common across southern Norton County.

The system tapped into deep tropical moisture resulting in very intense rainfall across a large portion of the area. Two-day rainfall totals of 10 inches or more were common across areas generally to the west and northwest of Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas. The heaviest rainfall occurred across a swath of East Baton Rouge, Livingston, and St. Helena Parishes, where 20 to 30 inches fell over a 48-hour period, topping the 0.1% annual exceedance probability. The heavy rainfall led to widespread flash flooding and record river flooding. Many of the broken records had been set during the flooding of April 1983. In total, 12 people died in southeast Louisiana as a result of the flooding. The event was also responsible for an estimated total of ten billion dollars in damage across southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi. This estimate includes impacts of both the initial flash flooding and the resultant river flooding.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Sixteen to twenty inches of rainfall over a 2 day period led to widespread flash flooding in St. Helena Parish. As water drained into area rivers, rapid rises and record flooding occurred along the Amite and Tickfaw Rivers. As floodwaters rose, numerous high water rescues were necessary across the parish. Road closures due to high water were common and over 400 homes and businesses suffered various degrees of damage. A section of Louisiana Highway 10 near the Coleman Town community was overtopped with some of the road washed out.  In Greensburg, flood waters rose high enough to enter the parish hospital. Two fatalities are attributed to the flash flooding. A 54 year old man drowned when his truck was submerged after being swept off a road east of Greensburg Friday afternoon. A 44 year old woman drowned when her vehicle was swept off Hwy 1045 near Montpelier Friday night.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 22.60M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Hot and humid conditions led to an unstable atmosphere. The instability along with the boundary caused a few severe thunderstorms to develop. Thunderstorms merged across Montgomery, Howard and Baltimore counties and led very heavy rainfall that led to flash flooding. Catastrophic flash flooding occurred in Ellicott City, MD the night of July 30th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The survey revealed clear signs of flooding both from the Patapsco River and from flash flooding within Ellicott City.  Signs of flooding, including damaged pavement, were observed as far up as the intersection of Rogers Avenue and Frederick Road, where Hudson Branch came out of its banks. From this location, eyewitnesses reported seeing water not only in the creek, but moving swiftly down Main Street beginning just after dark.  The intersection of Rogers Avenue and Frederick Road is about 140 feet higher in elevation than the lower part of Old Town Ellicott City. Erosion was noted on both the street side and the creek side of homes along Main Street in a portion of the 8500 block.||The next signs of damage were in the 8300 block of Main Street, with damage again observed both on the creek/river side and the street side of Main Street.  The creek/river side is where the most vehicles were impacted, in Lot D.||In the 8200 block, surveys and surveillance footage show water anywhere from 6 inches to two feet inside buildings on Main Street along with substantial damage to sidewalks and infrastructure outside the buildings.||The most significant damage observed was near 8100 Main Street, where the street curves slightly. Video surveillance footage reviewed after the event clearly indicates that water from the Tiber River was flowing through buildings on the south side of Main Street in this area, toward the street.||Closer to the Patapsco, damage continued with water marks observed 6-8 feet high on and in most buildings. The force of the floodwaters swept away the iconic Ellicott City clock as well as the historical flood marker that was attached to the railroad bridge.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 22.40M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

During the day a strong low level jet pumped very moist air into the region. The jet and a west to east stationary front were the triggers for thunderstorms that developed later in the day. Rounds of thunderstorms brought some damaging winds to parts of northwest Wisconsin late Monday afternoon and evening. These storms were followed by evening storms that began training as the night wore on. The training storms resulted in very heavy rain over the region. Historic flooding followed the extremely high average rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches. There was a wide corridor of about 8 to 10 inches of rain from northern Iron County to northern Burnett County, including Saxon Harbor on Lake Superior, and the towns  of Marengo, Cable, Hayward, Wascott, Minong, and Danbury.  The initial squall line of storms brought down many trees. The effects of the wind and a raging, flooded Oronto Creek caused enormous damage at Saxon Harbor. At Saxon Harbor, where 70 vessels were moored, 6 boats sank and the rest were set afloat. Most vessels were recovered. One man drowned in these floodwaters. The Bad River, which flows north through Ashland County into Lake Superior, set a new record, with the river level at Odanah reaching around 27.3 feet Tuesday morning, shattering the previous record of 22.2 feet set on June 24th, 1946. The Bad River Tribe of the Lake Superior Chippewa was totally cut off by the floodwater for days. ||Total damage to roads and public infrastructure across northern Wisconsin was $35 million. In Ashland County, road washouts and bridge repair costs were estimated at $2 to $4 million.  Washburn County damage was about $2.5 million. The Bad River Band of Ojibway had $2.3 million damage to roads. Forty-three miles of roads were damaged and closed on tribal land. ||The Wisconsin governor declared states of emergency for the following counties: Iron, Ashland, Bayfield, Douglas, Burnett, Washburn, Sawyer, and Price. The President later declared disasters for all of the same counties, except for Price. The USDA secretary declared the following counties agricultural disaster areas due to destroyed crops or sharply reduced yields: Douglas, Bayfield, Ashland, Iron, Washburn, Sawyer and Price.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flash flooding along the Oronto and Parker Creeks damaged the infrastructure of Saxon Harbor and parts of the Saxon Harbor Campground.

During the day a strong low level jet pumped very moist air into the region. The jet and a west to east stationary front were the triggers for thunderstorms that developed later in the day. Rounds of thunderstorms brought some damaging winds to parts of northwest Wisconsin late Monday afternoon and evening. These storms were followed by evening storms that began training as the night wore on. The training storms resulted in very heavy rain over the region. Historic flooding followed the extremely high average rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches. There was a wide corridor of about 8 to 10 inches of rain from northern Iron County to northern Burnett County, including Saxon Harbor on Lake Superior, and the towns  of Marengo, Cable, Hayward, Wascott, Minong, and Danbury.  The initial squall line of storms brought down many trees. The effects of the wind and a raging, flooded Oronto Creek caused enormous damage at Saxon Harbor. At Saxon Harbor, where 70 vessels were moored, 6 boats sank and the rest were set afloat. Most vessels were recovered. One man drowned in these floodwaters. The Bad River, which flows north through Ashland County into Lake Superior, set a new record, with the river level at Odanah reaching around 27.3 feet Tuesday morning, shattering the previous record of 22.2 feet set on June 24th, 1946. The Bad River Tribe of the Lake Superior Chippewa was totally cut off by the floodwater for days. ||Total damage to roads and public infrastructure across northern Wisconsin was $35 million. In Ashland County, road washouts and bridge repair costs were estimated at $2 to $4 million.  Washburn County damage was about $2.5 million. The Bad River Band of Ojibway had $2.3 million damage to roads. Forty-three miles of roads were damaged and closed on tribal land. ||The Wisconsin governor declared states of emergency for the following counties: Iron, Ashland, Bayfield, Douglas, Burnett, Washburn, Sawyer, and Price. The President later declared disasters for all of the same counties, except for Price. The USDA secretary declared the following counties agricultural disaster areas due to destroyed crops or sharply reduced yields: Douglas, Bayfield, Ashland, Iron, Washburn, Sawyer and Price.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A sheriff deputy was rescued from Twentymile Creek near Mason, WI after he mistakenly drove his vehicle into a washed-out section of road caused by heavy rainfall across the region. The deputy clung to a tree using an emergency tourniquet to keep from being swept away. It took emergency personnel close to 4 hours to rescue the deputy. The deputy was rushed to the hospital where he was hospitalized for kidney failure and other life-threatening problems associated with clinging to the tree in the flood waters. The deputy has since made a full recovery and returned to duty later that month.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Maximum sustained winds of 175 mph as it was approaching the county warning area. The direction was towards the west northwest with the eye clipping Saint Croix and Vieques. The hurricane then made landfall in the municipality of Yabucoa in mainland PR at 6:15 am AST with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph. The center of the storm traversed diagonally through mainland Puerto Rico exiting across the northwest municipalities in the early afternoon hours. Extreme winds  were observed across most of mainland Puerto Rico, Vieques, and Saint Croix with catastrophic flooding observed across many areas in mainland Puerto Rico.||During a preliminary survey of areas along the path of Hurricane Maria���s center, it was evident that catastrophic damage had occurred. Maria���s strong winds spread large amounts of debris across the entire area. All full trees were defoliated, and those that were not, were snapped or uprooted by Maria���s strong winds and lost medium to large branches. During the interview process, stories and images were particularly similar. Numerous locals reported that they felt the ground and their houses shaking, while most were amazed by the force of the unprecedented strong winds that not only transformed their surroundings but also their lives. Although most structures across the island are built using concrete as the main material, countless homes and buildings sustained some type of structural damage. If not blown off, non-concrete roofs suffered some type of damage. Nearly all commercial signs, fences, and canopies were destroyed, including large digital high definition boards. The last time that Puerto Rico experienced a category 4 or stronger hurricane was back on 1928 with Hurricane San Felipe II.  Maria was the strongest hurricane to make landfall in mainland Puerto Rico since Hurricane Felipe II in 1928, a category 5 storm. |The NOAA estimate of damage in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands due to Maria is 90 billion dollars.||Death toll from hurricane Maria at the moment of this report is highly uncertain. The official number stands at 65 deaths. 20 of these deaths occurred during the hurricane. The other 45 deaths occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane. From these 45 deaths, there were four (4) people which died due to heart attack,  three (3) due to lack of respiratory aid and three more (3) people due to lack of medical supplies. In addition two (2) deaths were due to suicides. One person (1) died when a tree fell over his car while driving. As of late November 2017, there were three (3) confirmed deaths from leptospirosis. One person (1) died during hurricane preparations. One women (1) died when she fell from her wheel chair. Her house was flooded, and she drowned.|The reasons of the remainder of the deaths are unknown at the moment of this publication.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Catastrophic flash flooding occurred along Rio Grande de Arecibo in the municipality of Utuado. Serious mudslides occurred across the municipality, were many bridges were totally destroyed, leaving most communities were isolated from getting food, gas and goods supplies.

The cold front gradually progressed across the Ohio Valley and thunderstorms initiated and swept east ahead of the front.

A rain gauge network in Mill Creek Township measured an instantaneous rainfall rate of over 7 inches per hour around 630 pm. The storms produced a measured 3.85 inches of rainfall  in the Erie/Mill Creek area. The intensity of the rainfall ultimately overwhelmed storm drainage systems causing significant overland flooding. In Mill Creek some roads were reported to have as much as five feet of water with numerous water rescues conducted. Some structures sustained damage and the Mill Creek Fire Department had to evacuate. The most significant damage occurred in on East 30th Street in Erie where a basement wall collapsed from the water pooling on the outside, trapping and ultimately drowning two residents. The flooding was likely exasperated by the poor drainage, but ultimately it was the torrential nature of the rainfall that caused the damages.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 270.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Another round of training storms developed the night of the 16th, fed by a moist low-level jet. Training storms and slow storm motion led to heavy rainfall across Douglas, Bayfield, Ashland and Iron counties. Three day rainfall amounts of 6-10 inches were common through these counties with a vast majority of it falling during the night of the 16th into the 17th. Areas of central Bayfield county saw in excess of 15 inches or rainfall during this event. This led to historic flooding focused in the Drummond, Grand View and Benoit areas of Bayfield County, along with the Foxboro, Chaffey and Dairyland areas of western Douglas County. The KDLH radar failed during the evening of June 16th and frequent lighting prevented the restoration of service until after daybreak on the 17th, resulting in the main radar covering this event not being available. One man was killed after his vehicle left the road and went into a ditch filled with 6-8 feet of water near the Bad River south of Ashland. Additionally, one or more microbursts were reported in central Sawyer County near Grindstone Lake resulting in tree damage and damage to homes. One man was killed when a tree fell on his camper near the town of Edgewater. The runoff from the storms continued to cause problems into the new week as it led to significant rises on area rivers and additional flooding. Damages estimates of $95,706 for Ashland County, $3,988,546 for Bayfield County, $66,180 for Burnett County, $3,875,140 for Douglas County, and $701,922 for Iron County, totaling $8,727,494. The DNR reported damage totaling $4,212,077 in the region, resulting in a total of $12,939,615 in damages in northwest Wisconsin from this event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A truck went into a ditch on County Truck E just south of County Trunk C in the Township of White River.

While many roadways were washed out across Northwestern Mariposa County, the homes were generally impacted near Lake Don Pedro, Hornitos, and the City of Mariposa. The two fatalities that did occur in the area were both related to a person driving into a flooded roadway. One was along highway 132 west of Coulterville and the other was near Cathey's Valley where a 72 year old woman was found dead nearly four months later.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

By the afternoon, it had made its way into central portions of the state, draping itself in a southwest to northeast fashion. Ahead of the front, the convective environment was ripe, with MUCAPE values in excess of 4000 J/kg and effective shear in the 30 to 40 kt range, with best values near the front.  While there was reason for concern with regards to severe weather, such has hail and damaging winds, there was also strong concern for an area of west-central, north central or central Iowa to receive heavy rainfall with the boundary placement, potential outflow boundary locations, low level jet initiation, and a very moist environment.  There was expectation for storms to be slow moving or training initially along the frontal boundary with propagation vectors opposing mean flow.||Initially storms fired up in the early afternoon across parts of northwest and north central Iowa in the very unstable environment, producing severe hail and wind damage. Fortunately, given their progressive nature, no water issues were seen with that round of convection. As the afternoon progressed, convection increased across northern areas, but remained quiet further south into central and southern Iowa. The initial northern convection pushed out an outflow boundary that made its way into the I-80 corridor, acting as another area for convective initiation. By the late evening, convection had fired up along the parent frontal boundary as well as portions of the aforementioned outflow boundary, producing marginally severe storms in most cases. By the time the low level jet kicked in, areas around Des Moines had already received a couple inches of rain, and now found the area in line for much more. Overall motion of storms was northeastward, but with nearly stationary frontal and outflow boundaries, backbuilding was induced by the low level jet, which resulted in copious amounts of heavy rainfall right on top of the Des Moines metro and surrounding areas. While some damaging wind was still ongoing, the primary concern was for heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and eventually a flash flood emergency. The Des Moines metro area took on widespread amounts of 6 or more inches, including a few reports of nearly 10 inches.  The main impacts revolved around flash flooding and the flash flood emergency with sewer systems and local streams absolutely overwhelmed. Dozens of vehicles were flooded or stranded, with numerous water rescues performed. Many streams were out of their banks, and an individual was swept away and killed during the flash flooding. One home had flooding and a gas leak that lead to an explosion of the home. Luckily all occupants had already been evacuated. Two streams with NWS stream gauge observations, Four Mile Creek and Walnut Creek, set all-time crest records.  Countless basements and businesses were flooded across the metro area and dozens of homes were completely flooded out on the southeast side where Four Mile Creek flooding was the worst. Two businesses had roof collapses from the heavy rain as well. The flash flooding and stream flooding continued into the overnight hours on July 1, so another entry is made in July 2018 for this event as well.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Emergency manager reported multiple water rescues across Ankeny, Johnston, Des Moines and Urbandale.

As the storm moved inland, from September 15 to 17,  heavy rain of 10 to 25 inches  caused widespread inland flooding, inundating cities such as Fayetteville, Smithfield, Goldsboro, Durham, and Chapel Hill, and causing major river flooding on main-stem rivers such as the Neuse, Cape Fear, and Little River. Most major roads and highways in the area experienced some flooding, with large stretches of I-40 and I-95 remaining impassable for days after the storm had passed.

A deep flow of tropical moisture into the Appalachians and central mid Atlantic region ahead of the storm began to generate excessive rainfall across portions of the region as early as Wednesday evening, mainly along the Interstate 77 corridor, causing some degree of flash flooding and otherwise saturating the ground even before the arrival of the rainfall directly associated with Michael.||As the storm circulation approached on Thursday, a cold front moving in from the west and interacted with the storm and enhanced rainfall especially east of Interstate 81. Widespread rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches were reported, along with local amounts over 10 inches, mainly from the mountains of North Carolina up through Southside Virginia. This resulted in significant flash flooding with flash flood emergencies issued for the city of Roanoke, as well as Roanoke County, and southern Pittsylvania county including the city of Danville.  Unfortunately, there were five fatalities as vehicles were swept away by flash flood waters in Pittsylvania County, Danville, and Charlotte County, Virginia.||The massive volume of water also then generated rapid rises on rivers including the New, Roanoke, and Dan. Major flooding was reported at several river gage locations along with a couple of record crests. There were a few landslides reported as well, blocking roads and in one case destroying a shed.||In addition, as the northern portion of the storm circulation moved across the Piedmont, bands of heavier rains/convection developed and mixed strong winds down to the surface.  Many trees were blown down in the water logged soil especially across Pittsylvania, Halifax and Charlotte counties of Virginia where rainfall was heaviest.  Despite some initial reports of tornado sightings, damage surveys revealed no conclusive evidence of tornadic circulations and judged damage was caused by straight line winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Danville City was included in a Presidential Major Disaster declaration due mainly to the severe flooding associated with Tropical Storm Michael. Catastrophic flash flooding occurred across the City of Danville as extreme rains of 4 to 8 inches in several hours fell. Two people were killed in Danville after being were caught inside vehicles in the floodwaters and were pulled under rising waters as rescuers struggled to reach them. The first was 53-year old man that occurred at 500 PM local time in the 100 block of Colonial Court. The second occurred around 1020 PM on Goodyear Boulevard, as a 60-year old woman was trapped in her car in floodwaters and drowned. There were at least a dozen other high water rescues reported several of these along Riverside Drive where water was reported up to four feet deep. There was severe road and property damage across Danville with costs running into the millions of dollars. According to an early assessment from the Danville Fire Chief, five properties were completely destroyed, 19  sustained major damage, 55 received minor damage and 117 structures were affected.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Flow peaked out about 285,000 CFS around 730 AM that morning nearly coming up to the level of the Highway 16 (Ford St.) bridge in town.  Several homes were flooded along the river with damage to the area parks as well.  A 58 year old woman lost her life in her vehicle as she was trying to get to work in town near West Sandstone and Flag Street.  Time when she entered the water is unknown but is estimated around 5 AM that morning.  Phone and internet service went down as the high water flow washed away phone lines underneath the Llano River Bridge.  Damage in the city of Llano will likely surpass 1 million dollars.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In fact, very heavy rainfall moved north into Kimble County from Edwards County, up the South Llano River watershed area during the early morning hours of Monday, October 8.  ||About eight to 12 inches of rain fell on already saturated ground, causing major flooding over the banks of Cedar Creek and the South Llano River.  A ranging flash flood on the South Llano flooded out an RV Park located on the South Llano River in Junction, drowning four campers.  The water level at the RV Park on the South Llano River was estimated at around 21 feet.  Earlier in the morning, the South Llano River at telegraph had risen to 35 feet before the gauge failed.  The gauge reading at the Llano River near Junction measured 31.53 feet on October 8.||Additional heavy rain fell across West Central Texas and resulted in flooding and flash flooding across the area.

First responders who arrived at the scene before daylight, heard people, who they were unable to see in trees and on top of RVs, calling for help.

The failure of these private dams contributed to additional overland flooding and most likely exacerbated the flooding in localized areas that led to community evacuations. The combination of weather elements on ice in the rivers led to increased runoff and rapid breakup of ice.

One fatality occurred in McDonald County in the town of Anderson, as a home was washed away along Beaver Branch, a tributary to Indian Creek. This was the first flood fatality in a permanent home in the Springfield WFO, CWA history (since 1994).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Excessive heavy rainfall caused rapid rises to occur on the Beaver Branch and Indian Creek. A home along Beaver Branch was swept off its foundation and washed downstream. An elderly woman in the home was unable to escape and perished in the flood waters. A bridge on Main Street received significant damage from rapidly moving high water where Beaver Branch flows through the middle of town. Significant damage occurred to a building in the vicinity of the bridge. Numerous evacuations were performed by emergency crews from homes, apartments and businesses. Around 80 homes and businesses received water damage as water several inches deep entered the structures. Some structures had as much as 3 feet of water in them.  The dollar damage amount is a summary for all damages in McDonald County for this event.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 800.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Showers across the southern Adirondacks and Mohawk Valley became steadier and heavier during the evening ahead of a strong cold front as the low continued to strengthen. Strong winds aloft mixed down to the surface as an intense line of showers developed along the front, resulting in sporadic wind damage and scattered power outages over eastern New York.||A large swath of rainfall totaling 2-5 inches, with isolated areas as high as 7 inches, occurred over the Mohawk Valley and southern Adirondacks, resulting in reports of flash flooding. The runoff caused rapid rises on area creeks and streams, with river gauges reaching record levels along the Mohawk River at Little Falls, the West Canada Creek at Hinckley and Kast Bridge, and the Sacandaga River at Hope.  Moderate flooding also occurred on the Hudson River at Fort Edward, Hadley, and North Creek; the Schroon River at Riverbank; and the Mohawk River at Delta Dam.  Although river rises and some impacts occurred prior to midnight, the crests occurred on 1 November, and impacts persisted into the first week of November in some areas (see also November StormData). The flooding was extensive over portions of the area, damaging and destroying numerous roads and structures and resulting in water rescues. Between 150 and 200 people were evacuated in Herkimer County. The number of dwellings damaged by the flooding was 344, of which 135 sustained major damage, and 18 were destroyed. There was one fatality as a result of the flooding as a man was swept away by flood waters when he exited his vehicle. ||As a result of the flooding, a major disaster for the state of New York was requested by Governor Cuomo and approved by the President. The monetary damages for public infrastructure requested for the Mohawk Valley and southern Adirondacks totaled around $17 million ($1.2 million for Fulton County, $3.0 million for Hamilton County, $8.8 million for Herkimer County, $0.5 million for Montgomery, $1.6 million for Saratoga, and $1.9 million for Warren). Actual damage amounts were estimated to be even higher by county emergency managers. A state of emergency was declared for Dutchess, Herkimer, Hamilton, Saratoga, and Warren Counties, and boil water notices were issued in Herkimer, Hamilton, and Warren Counties due to floodwater inundation of private and public water systems. The American Red Cross opened shelters to house those displaced by flood damage. ||Other impacts from the flooding and high winds included the cancellation of Amtrak service between Syracuse and Albany due to high water encroaching on train tracks, and portions of the Adirondack Park backcountry becoming impassable due to bridge washouts, high water at stream crossings, and downed trees and debris on trails and at trailheads.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The shoulder of Military Road in Norway collapsed due to flood waters.

Widely scattered thunderstorms began forming around 1 PM CST along and west of Highway 183. By 2 PM CST, a persistent line segment of thunderstorms began affecting western Dawson county. Over the following four hours, this southwest-northeast oriented line slowly crept east across Dawson county into western Buffalo county, with its southwest end moving from Gosper county into Phelps county. A downburst occurred in Cozad where winds were measured at 63 mph. Further east, trees were damaged near Elm Creek. This line of storms subsequently weakened as it moved into eastern Buffalo county. However, between 5 and 9 PM CST, numerous small thunderstorms formed over Gosper, Furnas, Phelps, and Harlan counties. Storms kept forming over these counties until a multi-county area of persistent heavy rain enveloped these counties and expanded north to include Dawson and Buffalo counties. By 9 PM CST, the heaviest rain had morphed to the southeast side of a large, expanding rain shield, with a nearly stationary band stretching from southwest to northeast across Furnas, Phelps, and Buffalo counties. After 10 PM CST, a large squall line that had developed far to the west, over the high plains, began moving into south-central Nebraska. It brought a third period of heavy rain to these counties, but its cold pool aided in shoving the training, slow-moving mass of heavy rain eastward. The two areas of rain merged with a progressive squall line subsequently advancing across the rest of the south central Nebraska. The squall line exited into southeast Nebraska by 230 AM CST. Severe downburst winds occurred a few spots with this squall line. A few tree limbs were snapped off in Oxford and Kearney, and 36 power poles were snapped off over a 2-mile stretch southeast of Holdrege. The highest rainfall total reported was 10.65 inches 3 miles southwest of Odessa. The second highest was 8.88 inches in Loomis. 8.33 fell near Hildreth, 7.66 in Riverdale, 7.60 near Lexington, 6.50 near Cozad, 5.90 near Minden, and 5.64 on the southwest side of Kearney.||Late in the afternoon, a few thunderstorms moved north from Kansas ahead of the storms west of Highway 183. These storms produced some spotty tree damage in Webster and Kearney counties, and damage two livestock sheds in the town of Ayr. A brief rope tornado was also reported near Roseland. ||At the surface, a stalled front extended from the Mid-Atlantic states west to the southern Kansas border. Throughout the day, this front gradually lifted north as a warm front. Meanwhile, low pressure over eastern Colorado moved into northwest Kansas, joining the western end of the front. In the upper-levels weak southwest flow was over Nebraska with a longwave trough advancing eastward through the western U.S., and a ridge over the Upper Midwest. An embedded shortwave trough moved out of Colorado and crossed Nebraska, creating a favorable environment for thunderstorms. As the initial thunderstorms developed, the environment was characterized by surface temperatures in the lower to middle 80s, with dewpoints in the lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, but despite that, MLCAPE was 2500-3000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was weak at less than 20 kt. Precipitable water values were around 1.70 inches, which was close to a record. ||The excessive rainfall resulted in flash flooding in parts of Dawson, Gosper, Furnas, Harlan, Phelps, and Buffalo counties, including flooding across parts of U.S. Highways 6, 30, 183, and 283. Numerous gravel county roads were inundated by flood waters and impassible. Many of them were severely damaged. Roads in the city of Kearney were flooded from one curb to the other, and in at least two separate places, water was 3 to 4 ft deep. Almost 40 vehicles were stranded in Kearney streets. Basements were flooded in some homes due to egress windows breaking. The student union was flooded on the University of Nebraska campus in Kearney. Two to three feet of water was reported in the lower level of the food court. In Lexington, cars were stalled in flood waters and 23 people were evacuated from an apartment building due to flooding. The Red Cross opened a shelter to care for those evacuated.||In some areas, the impacts worsened the following day as creeks swelled out of their banks. Gibbon, Kearney, Odessa, Elm Creek, and Lexington were all severely impacted. U.S. highway 30 was closed due to floodwater from Shelton to Kearney to Elm Creek, as well as near Lexington. Turkey Creek drains into the North Channel of the Platte River, which runs through the south side of Kearney. Water rapidly rose on the south side of the city Tuesday morning, inundating numerous hotels, restaurants, businesses, and basements. At least 200 people had to be evacuated from hotels using construction grade front-end loaders. Approximately 100 other nearby residents needed to be evacuated as well. At its peak, water was 2 to 4 feet high inside the hotels, and 4 to 5 feet high in the parking lots. The water rose so quickly that many people staying at the hotels did not have time to move their vehicles. Most vehicles at the hotels were a total loss. Hundreds of vehicles in the city had to be towed. Some businesses were closed for weeks, others for months, as repairs and remodeling were completed. Kitchen equipment was ruined at some restaurants. Of the 1800 hotels rooms in Kearney, only about 600 were available for use because first floor services, such as check-in desks, laundry facilities, and kitchens were damaged. Stagecoach souvenir shop lost 2,000 pounds of merchandise. Second avenue, which is the main north-south thoroughfare through the city, was closed from Interstate 80 to 11th avenue. The Interstate 80 off ramp was also closed. All traffic to and from the Interstate, from the city, had to use the Kearney East Expressway. Approximately 400 Kearney homes were damaged by the flood, and many more beyond city limits. Just as one example, an egress window gave way in a home on the southeast side of Kearney. Water rushed into the basement, filling it nearly to the ceiling. Extensive flooding resulted in the closure of Yanney Park. A power substation flooded and resulted in power outages to about 450 customers. Flood waters began to subside Wednesday, July 10th, which allowed for one lane of 2nd avenue to be reopened in each direction.||In Odessa, flooding was significant. Water was 4 feet deep on Webb street. A little further south, the Odessa exit from Interstate 80 was closed because of significant flooding. Water was about 3 feet deep at the truck stop adjacent to the Interstate. Semi trucks and cars pulled into the truck stop due to the heavy rain Monday evening, but by 630 AM CST Tuesday, water was up to the top of the wheel wells on several semi's. Flooded vehicles had to be towed. The Platte River, which is very wide and shallow, rose 3 feet in 12 hours from 6 PM CST Monday to 6 AM CST Tuesday, and 4 feet in 24 hours. It is very difficult for the Platte River to flood, but it crested at 8.3 feet at 515 PM CST Tuesday. Flood stage is 7 feet.||In the town of Elm Creek, many roads and basements were flooded. A gauge on Elm Creek indicated that the water level rose 8 feet in 2 hours Monday evening.||The city of Lexington issued a disaster declaration due to the disruption of utility services. Streets and homes were flooded with sewers backing up into homes. ||Flooding was extensive along the Wood River. Moderate flooding occurred at Riverdale with water covering the bridge just north of town. Further to the north, flooding forced the closure of state highway 10 between Pleasanton and Hazard.||In Gibbon, water flooded streets and basements for the second time this year. The northeast side of town was impacted the worst with at least 30 homes and several businesses inundated by floodwater. People had to sandbag their homes and businesses. It is believed that flooding on the Wood River was wider with this event, due to changes in the riverbed from the prior flood in March. Some places that did not flood in that event, flooded this time. Many people commented, I can't believe this has happened twice. Several businesses affected by the March flood still remained closed due to damage.||Amtrak trains that travel between Chicago and Emeryville, CA were halted in Lincoln and McCook due to the flooding. There were probably many more impacts that were not documented here as it is not possible to include everything. Widespread flooding of low-lying areas, creeks, and rivers continued for several days following the excessive rain. Flood waters did not recede in some locations until Monday, July 15th. This devastating flood occurred just four months after a catastrophic flood occurred nearby in mid-to-late March. That flood affected areas primarily along and north of the Platte River.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 46 year old female from Eustis died from injuries sustained in an automobile accident when she encountered flood waters over Highway 21 approximately 4 miles south of Cozad.

This combined with a moisture rich atmosphere which led to a heavy rain threat, in addition to a hail and strong wind  threat. The heaviest rain fell over Sioux and Emmons counties, where there were multiple reports of over four inches of rain. In Sioux County, on the Standing Rock Nation, flash flooding from the heavy rain resulted in a section of BIA Road 3, locally known as the Kenel Road, being washed out at the crossing with Joe Bush Creek.

This location is several miles south of Sedgwickville. Two of the occupants lost their lives, and the other two were treated for injuries. The survivors were the 33-year-old male driver and a 2-year-old boy. Two young boys aged 5 and 8 years old were killed. The location of the flash flood fatalities was in a hilly area, where numerous low water crossings are prone to frequent inundation. A volunteer firefighter familiar with the area estimated the water depth was 3 to 4 feet where the driver of the SUV attempted to cross the creek. The injured victims were airlifted or taken by ambulance to regional hospitals with moderate to serious injuries. The victims were all members of the same family. In the second incident, a truck was swept away at the low water crossing of Upper Whitewater Creek on County Road 234. This location is a couple miles east of Sedgwickville. The 48-year-old male driver from Louisiana was killed. The vehicle was found upside down in the water.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An upper level disturbance ejecting northeast ahead of the trough across portions of East Texas and North Louisiana during the early morning hours of April 13th carried enough elevated instability, shear, and forcing north of an advancing warm front over Southeast Texas and South Louisiana, such that scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developed, with numerous reports of large hail and occasional damaging winds received. The warm front continued to gradually mix north northwest into East Texas and Northcentral Louisiana by late morning and early afternoon hours, with a very warm, moist, and unstable air mass noted over Deep East Texas and portions of Northcentral Louisiana south of the front. Coupled with even stronger forcing and low level shear ahead of the approaching upper trough, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed near and south of the front from late morning through the afternoon, producing several reports of damaging winds across portions of Northcentral Louisiana. These storms also produced locally heavy rainfall that led to instances of flash flooding, which resulted in two separate fatalities in Ouachita Parish. A 13 year old boy drowned in a drainage canal in the Bawcomville community during the heavy rains, and an 80 year old female drove past barricades on a closed road in Calhoun several hours after the heavy rains had ended, with her car becoming submerged in the flood waters. Unfortunately, she was unable to escape and drowned.

Meanwhile, a warm front over Central and Southeast Texas into Southern Louisiana lifted slowly north into portions of East Texas and Central Louisiana during the afternoon. Large scale forcing quickly increased ahead of this trough such that showers and thunderstorms developed near and north of the front during the day, where cold temperatures aloft ahead of the trough and north of the warm front contributed to steep lapse rates, resulting in slightly elevated showers and thunderstorms to develop over much of East Texas and North Louisiana. The storms over Deep East Texas and the southern sections of North Central Louisiana near the front which were rooted closer to the surface became severe, producing more in the way of damaging winds and large hail, with storms farther north across Northwest Louisiana more elevated, producing more sporadic wind damage and large hail. Locally heavy rainfall over relatively saturated grounds also resulted in instances of flash flooding as well.

During the onset of the heavier rainfall, a few storms caused wind damage near Tainter Lake and Colfax, but most of the damage was minor with a few large tree limbs and power lines blown down. ||Deep moisture convergence along the axis of thunderstorms, training along the periphery of the the numerous boundaries, combined with PWAT values of 1.7 to 1.9 inches which is over the 99th percentile value, caused extreme rainfall rates. ||Before the flash flooding event developed, there was an hour or two during Sunday evening that dropped locally one to two inches of rainfall in the areas that received more torrential rainfall in the early morning hours. ||There was one main band of excessive rainfall that occurred in west central Wisconsin during the early morning. This area was from Prescott, northeast toward River Falls and Baldwin. Based on the return period from precipitation amounts in a specific time frame, the values were a 100-200 year event. Flash flood guidance values were 1.5 to 2 times above normal.  ||As the runoff continued through the morning, the flash flood event become more areal flooding as the flood waters receded into creeks, streams, and eventually the mainstem rivers. Other areas that experienced flooding but not as significant include the New Richland Golf Course. The St. Croix County Sheriff Office documented the flood damage the next day from their drone. From the video, you could see numerous culverts and roads that were washed away including crop fields (near the creeks and streams) that were inundated nearly 24 hours after the initial rainfall started. ||Some of the higher rainfall totals around the area are as follows.||Emerald measured 9.84 inches.|Baldwin measured 8.72 inches. |River Falls measured 6.34 to 7.82 inches around the city. |Roberts measured 7.24 inches. |Menomonie measured 5.08 to 5.64 inches around the city.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Parts of St. Croix County received over 8 to 9 inches of rain causing flooding and washed out roads across the county. The worst areas that experienced significant flooding were the Kinnickinnic, Rush and Eau Galle Recreation River areas, and the towns of Hammond, Baldwin, Emerald, Glenwood City, and Cylon. ||Some of the specific roads that were closed or washed out during the height of the flooding were: 1000 Block of 190th Street in Baldwin, 2100 110th Avenue in Baldwin, Country Road TK, DD & 240th Street in Baldwin, Highway 12 & 220th Street in Baldwin Township, 2254 130th Avenue in Emerald, 2900 Block of 200th Avenue in Glenwood City, and West Blvd & Highway 65 in Roberts.||Unfortunately,  A man died after he lost control while driving on a water-covered road north of Baldwin near County Road E and Highway 63. At least five other motorists standing on the roofs of their cars were rescued from rushing water in that same location in the Baldwin area.||About $4 Million dollars in damages was due to 40 homes that sustained major damage and one that was destroyed when the foundation caved in. The other $4 Million dollars was due to bridge, highway and road damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Heavy rainfall associated with the thunderstorm led to an estimated 1-2 of rain within 20-30 minutes over the headwaters of the Alder Creek basin, resulting in a flash flood with debris coming down Alder Creek. A group of people camping at the foot of Alder Creek on the north shore of Apache Lake attempted to flee the area by boat as the flash flood approached. The flash flood with debris caused an inoperable boat carrying five adults to capsize. Three out of the five adults were rescued out of the water by another boat. The other two adults, a 41 year old female and a 52 year old male, died as a result of drowning and were recovered by Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. Collaboration between the National Weather Service, Arizona Geological Survey, and Maricopa County Flood Control District determined that this event was not a debris flow.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The MCS produced widespread strong winds with localized damaging winds from individual microbursts across the region. The strong winds also generated dense blowing dust in southwest Arizona. In addition to the wind, storms were producing average rain rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour with briefly higher rates in the strongest cells. This led to flash flooding in multiple areas. The town of Gila Bend suffered catastrophic flash flooding after 2 to 4 inches of rain fell over a large portion of the basin containing Sand Tank and Bender Washes, which flow into Gila Bend. A breach of the canal in town due to erosion added to the flash flooding. Significant flow through the washes impacted numerous homes and businesses and there were 2 fatalities. A state of emergency was declared for this event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Following 2 to 4 inches of rain in 1 to 2 hours over the Sand Tank Wash watershed, catastrophic flooding occurred in the small town of Gila Bend with feet of water, mud, and debris moving through town. Storm surveys were completed by NWS Phoenix, Maricopa County Department of Emergency Management (MCDEM), American Red Cross, and Flood Control District of Maricopa County (FCDMC). FCDMC gages on Sand Tank Wash, Bender Wash, and in the Maricopa Mountains measured rainfall amounts around 3 to 4 inches in 1 to 2 hours for an annual exceedance probability of 0.1%. FCDMC found the most significant floodwaters were within Sand Tank Wash, with lesser flows in Bender and Scott Avenue Washes. The NWS Phoenix survey found evidence of out of bank flooding in Sand Tank Wash 1 to 3 miles south of Interstate-8 (I-8) with 2 to 6 feet of water and sizable debris. The streamflow gage on Sand Tank Wash at I-8 reached alarm stage at 0157MST, bank full at 0341MST, and flood stage at 0352MST. The gage crested at 7.69 feet with 5000 cfs of flow at 0408MST. The floodwaters and debris that moved through town caused flood damage to at least 140 homes and 25 businesses. Most structures impacted were between the Gila Bend Canal and Main Street and then along Pima Street. During the flooding, Maricopa County Sheriff's Office rescued at least 30 individuals from their roofs along with others pulled from stranded vehicles. Photos after the water receded showed the canal was eroded and breached where Sand Tank Wash flows over it. Photos also showed 2 to 5 foot water lines both on the outside and inside of many of the structures, piles of debris, damaged property and vehicles, and erosion. Of the homes MCDEM assessed, 21 were deemed uninhabitable after the flooding. Unfortunately there were 2 direct fatalities with this event. One made a heroic effort to save a stranded motorist before they themselves were swept away in their own vehicle. The other was swept away in one of the flooded washes. Additionally, many farm animals were killed. Besides the fatalities, no other injuries were reported. A state of emergency was declared for this event.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A warm front moved northward into Middle Tennessee early on March 27 before stalling near the I-40 corridor. Between 300-400 AM CDT, numerous showers and thunderstorms developed along the warm front, many of which became severe and produced large hail up to half dollar size along with frequent lightning and heavy rainfall. Showers and storms continued off and on the rest of the day across Middle Tennessee, particularly near the stalled warm front. In fact, another round of severe thunderstorms including supercells developed during the afternoon and evening hours near and south of the warm front. These storms dropped large hail up to tennis ball size and caused a few reports of wind damage, but the main impact was additional heavy rainfall which began causing flash flooding south of Nashville. Flooding only worsened as showers and storms redeveloped over the same areas through the evening, with numerous Flash Flood Warnings issued and several reports of flooded roads and water rescues.||After midnight, even more heavy rainfall falling along the already waterlogged I-40 corridor prompted a rare Flash Flood Emergency for the southern and eastern Nashville metro area, including southeastern Davidson County, western Wilson County, and northern Williamson County. These areas received between 7 to 9 of rain, causing rapid rises on several Nashville metro creeks and streams, including Sevenmile Creek (which reached its highest level on record), Browns Creek, and Mill Creek, among others. Many of these creeks reached within their 2nd or 3rd highest water levels on record. The rapid water rises flooded hundreds of homes and businesses, with reports of some people trapped in the attics or on the roofs of their houses. Dozens of roadways were flooded and impassable, including both I-24 and I-40, with many cars submerged in the flood waters and people forced to cling onto trees to avoid getting swept away. Although the flood waters receded quickly on Sunday, March 28, many area rivers reached flood stage in the week after the event, including the Cumberland River, Harpeth River, and Duck River.||A total of 7 deaths were reported from the flooding across Middle Tennessee, with 5 in Davidson County, 1 in Cheatham County, and 1 in Maury County. Emergency management reports indicate over 500 homes and businesses were flooded, and a Presidential Disaster Proclamation was declared for many counties in May 2021. This flash flood event was the worst seen in Middle Tennessee since the May 1-2, 2010 flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Significant flash flooding affected far northern Maury County. A woman attempting to clear debris blocking a drainage culvert on her property at 6415 Leipers Creek Road was swept through the culvert and drowned. Several roads were flooded and closed, including Fairview Road at Les Robinson Road west of Spring Hill, and Duplex Road between Highway 31 and Miles Johnson Parkway in Spring Hill. Flood waters also reportedly covered the parking lot of Walmart in Spring Hill on Highway 31.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 334.90K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several reports of large hail was received across central and eastern New Mexico, and a few tornadoes and landspouts were observed across the plains. The anomalously moist air mass allowed for heavy rain to fall as well, especially across south central and southeast New Mexico which received rainfall totals of three to five inches in a very short period of time. This led to flash flooding in Lincoln and Chaves counties in which several water rescues had to be performed. Widespread damage was reported as well with multiple businesses, homes, and vehicles being inundated with flood waters. Tragically, one individual in southern Lincoln County drowned while trying to cross a flooded roadway in their vehicle.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rainfall in the Hondo area caused widespread flooding of roads and low water crossings.

The individual then either tried to escape or the flood waters pulled them out of their truck. Tragically, they drowned, and their body was found the next day.

A warm front moved northward into Middle Tennessee early on March 27 before stalling near the I-40 corridor. Between 300-400 AM CDT, numerous showers and thunderstorms developed along the warm front, many of which became severe and produced large hail up to half dollar size along with frequent lightning and heavy rainfall. Showers and storms continued off and on the rest of the day across Middle Tennessee, particularly near the stalled warm front. In fact, another round of severe thunderstorms including supercells developed during the afternoon and evening hours near and south of the warm front. These storms dropped large hail up to tennis ball size and caused a few reports of wind damage, but the main impact was additional heavy rainfall which began causing flash flooding south of Nashville. Flooding only worsened as showers and storms redeveloped over the same areas through the evening, with numerous Flash Flood Warnings issued and several reports of flooded roads and water rescues.||After midnight, even more heavy rainfall falling along the already waterlogged I-40 corridor prompted a rare Flash Flood Emergency for the southern and eastern Nashville metro area, including southeastern Davidson County, western Wilson County, and northern Williamson County. These areas received between 7 to 9 of rain, causing rapid rises on several Nashville metro creeks and streams, including Sevenmile Creek (which reached its highest level on record), Browns Creek, and Mill Creek, among others. Many of these creeks reached within their 2nd or 3rd highest water levels on record. The rapid water rises flooded hundreds of homes and businesses, with reports of some people trapped in the attics or on the roofs of their houses. Dozens of roadways were flooded and impassable, including both I-24 and I-40, with many cars submerged in the flood waters and people forced to cling onto trees to avoid getting swept away. Although the flood waters receded quickly on Sunday, March 28, many area rivers reached flood stage in the week after the event, including the Cumberland River, Harpeth River, and Duck River.||A total of 7 deaths were reported from the flooding across Middle Tennessee, with 5 in Davidson County, 1 in Cheatham County, and 1 in Maury County. Emergency management reports indicate over 500 homes and businesses were flooded, and a Presidential Disaster Proclamation was declared for many counties in May 2021. This flash flood event was the worst seen in Middle Tennessee since the May 1-2, 2010 flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Major and historic flash flooding affected southern and eastern Davidson County, with the worst flooding affecting areas along and near Sevenmile Creek and Mill Creek in south Nashville. Hundreds of homes and businesses were flooded, numerous roadways were flooded and closed including I-24, I-40, and I-440, and over 130 water rescues were conducted from people stranded in flooded vehicles and homes. Homes and businesses that were flooded included a hotel at 95 Wallace Road near I-24 at Harding Place, the South Brooke Apartments on Linbar Drive, many homes around Edmondson Pike at Blackman Road, the Walmart on Nolensville Pike at Harding Place with vehicles in the parking lot submerged up to their windows, a home on Truxton Court in Donelson, and the Kroger on Old Hickory Blvd in Hermitage which also had cars stalled in flood waters in the parking lot. Residents were trapped and rescued from the second stories of homes on Paragon Mills Road, and the attics of homes on Currey Road and also on Suter Drive near Edmondson Pike. Other people were rescued clinging to trees or in flood waters in the 400 block of Hogan Road, on Milner Drive, and in the 400 block of Harding Place. Interstate 24 near Antioch Pike was submerged with many vehicles stranded and around one dozen drivers rescued, and Interstate 40 and Interstate 440 were also flooded in a few areas. Other roads that were flooded and impassable included Rosa Parks Blvd near the Farmers Market, Highway 70 near White Bridge Road, Dodson Chapel Road, Tulip Grove Road, and Chandler Road. A total of 5 people were killed, 3 of which were swept away from a homeless camp along Sevenmile Creek near Edmondson Pike at Nolensville Pike. Another man drowned when he left his submerged vehicle and was swept away near the Nashboro Village Golf Course at Nashboro Blvd at Flintlock Court, and another man drowned in his vehicle behind the Walmart near Harding Place at Nolensville Pike.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Ida made landfall across southeast Louisiana during the late morning on August 29th. Ida turned north and northeast across central Mississippi during late afternoon and evening on Monday, August 30th.||The core of the hurricane force winds was relatively small, only extending out from the center about 50 miles. However tropical storm force winds extended outward over 150 miles from the center. This brought tropical storm force wind gusts to southeast Mississippi and much of southwest Alabama, with a brief period of sustained tropical storm force winds to coastal Alabama. Wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph were recorded across southeast Mississippi and southwestern Alabama. The tropical storm force winds also downed several trees across the area.||The highest storm surge inundation values observed were between 3 to 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. Storm surge surveys indicated the highest water levels were in the Bayou La Batre area along and near Shell Belt Road where peak water levels were in the 4 to 4.5 feet MHHW range.||The slow movement of the storm caused widespread flooding especially across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. Rainfall amounts of anywhere from 7 to 12 inches were recorded across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. This led to significant flash flooding along with significant river flooding.||Two tornadoes during the afternoon on August 30th. An EF-1 in northern Mobile County and an EF-1 in southern Clarke County.||Here is a breakdown of county impacts:||Stone County MS: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed several trees in Stone|County. Seven to ten inches of rain was recorded and one road had to be barricaded due to flooding. The low lying red creek and mill creek areas experienced flooding, impacting two RV parks.||George County MS: Eight to twelve inches of rain fell across George county which|resulted in significant flash flooding. A portion of Highway 26 collapsed just west of Lucedale, killing three people and injuring seven others. Eleven other roads were significantly flooded and had some form of washout or damage.||Mobile County AL: The west end of Dauphin Island was significantly impacted by Ida|from a combination of high surf, storm surge, and tropical storm force winds. Three miles of Bienville boulevard was impassable due to surge flooding and sand up to four feet deep. The high surf also produced minor damage to a few homes on the west end. Power poles were also knocked down on the island. Storm surge inundation peaked|between 3 and 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. The highest tidal gauge readings were 3.78 feet MHHW at Coast Guard sector Mobile and 3.82 feet MHHW at the Bayou La Batre bridge. Storm surge surveys along Shell Belt road in Bayou La Batre indicated water lines that reached between 4-4.5 feet.||This surge flooding resulted in closures of low lying coastal roads, such as Shell Belt road, the US Highway 90 causeway, the foot of the Dog river bridge, and the Dauphin Island causeway. Coastal flooding persisted across three high tide cycles which resulted in prolonged closures. Observations at Dauphin Island and Buccaneer Yacht Club on|Mobile Bay measured brief sustained periods of tropical storm force winds between 40-45 mph. Gusts of 50 to 60 mph were recorded in heavier rain bands across central and southern Mobile county. An EF-1 tornado impacted parts of Saraland, Satsuma, and Creola early in the afternoon on August 30th, resulting in three injuries. Rainfall|totals of 8 to 11 inches were recorded across the county, especially in southern and central portions. This heavy rainfall led to some urban flooding in neighborhoods and damaged some drainage culverts.||Baldwin County AL: Storm surge inundation of 3 to 4 feet above normally dry ground was recorded from Weeks Bay northward. This resulted in flooding of low lying areas and closure of the US Highway 90 Causeway. Five to nine inches of rain was measured across Baldwin county, which resulted in areas of flash flooding. A portion of River Road along Styx River was washed out due to heavy rainfall and flooding. A few drainage culverts were also significant damaged in the county. Tropical storm conditions were confined primarily to immediate coastal areas, particularly along the Fort Morgan peninsula.||Clarke County AL: An EF-1 Tornado impacted portions of southern Clarke County, significantly damaging a couple of structures.||Escambia County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand on coastal roadways along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for an extended period of time.||Santa Rosa County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for and extended period of time.||Okaloosa County FL: Strong rip currents produced by Ida resulted in two rip current fatalities in the wake of the storm. One occurred on September 1st when a 14 year old teen drowned off a Destin Beach. The other fatality occurred on September 4th when a 58 year old man drowned off Henderson Beach State Park.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Very heavy rainfall with 2 inch per hour rain rates fell over very saturated conditions and resulted in additional flash flooding. This resulted in the collapse of a portion of Highway 26 near Crossroads Road. Several vehicles drove into a 50 foot deep hole.

Occurring only a few months after another deadly and disastrous flash flood impacted the Nashville metro area on March 27-28, 2021 and killed 7 people, this flash flood left catastrophic damage across several counties in western Middle Tennessee, including parts of Dickson County, Hickman County, Houston County, and especially Humphreys County. The flood waters damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes, businesses, vehicles, and schools, with many buildings washed completely off their foundations. The damage was so severe that a Presidential Disaster Declaration was declared for Humphreys County two days later on August 23, 2021. Later in the week, Dickson, Hickman, and Houston Counties also received a Presidential Disaster Declaration. Very sadly, a total of 20 people were determined to have drowned in the flood, 19 of which were in the city of Waverly, TN, and 1 in the community of Hurricane Mills.||This historic flash flood occurred as a thunderstorms repeatedly developed along a weak surface front located over western Middle Tennessee during the morning hours of August 21. With a very moisture-laden atmosphere in place characterized by precipitable water values measured at 2.37 inches on the 12Z OHX upper air balloon sounding, these thunderstorms produced extreme rainfall rates over 3 inches per hour for several hours, resulting in rainfall totals reaching over 10 to 20 inches in a narrow, roughly 25 mile wide by 50 mile long swath across Houston, Dickson, Humphreys, and Hickman Counties. A rain gauge at the McEwen Wastewater Treatment Plant measured a rainfall total of 20.73 inches from midnight to 7pm CDT, which was verified by NWS personnel and set a new Tennessee state record for 24-hour rainfall. In addition to the flash flooding, one brief tornado was determined to have touched down in rural Dickson County northwest of Charlotte.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An historic, devastating flash flood struck the city of Waverly along the Trace Creek river basin. A fast-moving flood wave traveling westward down Trace Creek caused flood waters to rise several feet in roughly a 10 minute timespan between 1000am to 1010am CDT, flooding hundreds of homes, businesses, and churches, some of which were washed off their foundations. News reports and information from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency indicated a total of 523 homes were impacted by the flooding, with 272 totally destroyed, 168 with major damage, 31 with minor damage, and 20 affected. 44 businesses and 8 public facilities were also damaged, including the Waverly Elementary School and Waverly Junior High School which will have to be torn down are rebuilt in a different location. Dozens of cars were also washed away and deposited long distances downstream, and many of the roadway bridges than spanned Trace Creek were knocked off their pilings and heavily damaged. TEMA reported damage to roads and schools alone totaled $31,844,911, with an additional estimated $60-70 million in damage to homes and businesses. 19 people were killed in Waverly, along with 1 other who died in Hurricane Mills, making this the deadliest flash flood in Middle Tennessee history.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Tropical moisture and strong southeast upslope flow into the Blue Ridge mountains resulted in widespread showers and some thunderstorms producing extremely heavy rainfall rates. By the time the rain tapered off by the end of the 17th, 24-hour rainfall amounts of 5-12 inches were reported across portions of the mountains and foothills. This was in addition to a small area of 5-10 inch amounts that fell across portions of the southern North Carolina mountains during the morning of the 16th. The result of this rainfall was significant to catastrophic flash flooding across portions of the French Broad and Pigeon River basins, including some of the worst flooding to impact these areas in almost 20 years. The most severe flooding occurred in portions of southern and central Haywood County, where a number of fatalities and hundreds of millions of dollars and damage occurred.

Flash flooding initially developed along the West Fork and especially the East Fork of the Pigeon River. Water from the latter stream, swept downstream through the Cruso community causing widespread damage. Six people were killed in Cruso, four of them in a campground along the East Fork, where numerous recreational vehicles and automobiles were swept away. Water from the two forks of the river rushed downstream to the main channel of the Pigeon, causing major flooding along the stream in Canton and Clyde for the first time since Tropical Cyclone Ivan in September 2004. Numerous buildings in downtown Canton were inundated. In total, around 700 homes were impacted by flooding, with a couple of hundred of those destroyed. Numerous vehicles were also swept away or otherwise damaged and hundreds of people were rescued. Dozens of roads were flooded, with many roads and bridges damaged or destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

On August 26th, the wave developed into a tropical depression, which organized further and became Tropical Storm Ida later that day, near Grand Cayman. On a northwestward track, Ida intensified into a hurricane on August 27, just before moving over western Cuba. A day later, the hurricane underwent rapid intensification over the Gulf of Mexico as it passed over a warm core eddy and reached major hurricane strength. It was just under 72 hours from tropical depression formation to category 4 strength with 150 mph winds. Ida remained at its peak intensity of 150 mph winds and a minimum central pressure of 929 millibars as it made landfall near Port Fourchon midday on August 29th. It didn���t weaken to a tropical storm until it reached near the Louisiana/Mississippi border. ||Ida produced extensive to catastrophic damage across southeast Louisiana. On Grand Isle, around 40% of the structures were destroyed and the island was uninhabitable. Near 75% of the structures in Lafourche Parish were damaged or destroyed and likely similar numbers in Terrebonne Parish. 100+ mph wind gusts reached as far inland as Interstate 12. These winds damaged more than 30,000 poles, over 36,000 spans of wire and nearly 6,000 transformers. Of those more than 30,000 Louisiana poles, nearly 80% of those broken or damaged are from the most heavily impacted areas.|In total, the number of damaged or destroyed poles from Ida is more than hurricanes Katrina, Ike, Delta and Zeta combined. Due to major destruction to the power grid across the region, over 1 million customers were without power after landfall. Some of those power outages near the Louisiana coast lasted for around 4 weeks. |||The Louisiana Department of Health reported 3 direct fatalities and 28 indirect fatalities. Excessive heat and carbon monoxide poisoning were the most common causes of death. Indirect injuries associated with Ida: 351 heat-related, 183 carbon monoxide exposure, and 3 electrocutions. Storm surge ranged from a few feet to 10 to 15 feet. Hurricane Ida caused approximately $30 billion worth of damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Significant street flooding occurred in a few parts of the parish, though no homes were reported to take on water. One man drowned when he drove into a flooded underpass on I-10.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
