By the afternoon hours, large amounts of moisture and instability were present, along with plenty of deep-layer wind shear. As a mid-level disturbance lifted out of the Southern Plains, multiple storm clusters and bowing segments formed across Missouri in a very favorable environment for severe thunderstorms. There was also a supercell thunderstorm in the Ozark foothills during the evening. Dew points were in the lower 70's in many locations in the afternoon, coupled with surface cape values of 3000-4000 j/kg. Boundaries left over from early morning storms also played a role in the placement of afternoon thunderstorm development. Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms impacted the middle Mississippi Valley on the first day of the Memorial Day holiday weekend. There were two or three bowing lines of thunderstorms that impacted the region with damaging winds. Individual cells and clusters also developed early on in the event, producing both large hail and strong winds. Multiple rounds of storms over the same locations also resulted in locally heavy rainfall. Rainfall totals of 1.5 to 3 inches were observed from Carter County, Missouri east into southern Scott County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Multiple trees were uprooted on D Highway a few miles southeast of Greenville. One vehicle was struck by a falling tree, with minor injuries. Multiple trees were down in a campground.

A line of strong to severe thunderstorms with embedded circulations, known as a Quasi-Linear Convective System (or QLCS), moved rapidly across Middle Tennessee at 60-70 mph from west to east between 6 AM and 10 AM CST. Additional severe thunderstorms developed later in the morning and affected areas of southern Middle Tennessee from the late morning into the early afternoon hours. Widespread damaging winds were reported in nearly every county along and north of I-40 across Middle Tennessee, with winds estimated up to 90 mph in some areas. These intense downburst winds caused 3 injuries - two in Clarksville when a tree fell on a mobile home, and one in Lavergne when a tractor trailer flipped over. In addition to the damaging winds, 7 confirmed tornadoes also touched down from the Nashville metro area eastward to the Upper Cumberland, damaging hundreds of homes and businesses. Several reports of large hail were also received in parts of southern Middle Tennessee.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An 8 mile long swath of wind damage struck the north side of Clarksville in association with a small mesovortex on HPX radar. The Montgomery County EOC received 26 reports of trees and power lines blown down across the city with 9 roads blocked by fallen trees or power poles. One tree fell onto a home on Parker Drive, and another tree fell on a garage on Dalewood Drive. A large tree fell through a mobile home on Riley Road, injuring a mother as well as her 12 year old son, and another tree fell and damaged a nearby mobile home and cars. A tree also fell on a home on Rossview Road, and a preschool suffered minor damage on Old Russellville Pike.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Ahead of the QLCS, isolated severe storms developed and produced large hail in many parts of Middle Tennessee during the evening on March 9. As the QLCS moved across the region, widespread damaging winds were reported in nearly every county along and west of I-24 across Middle Tennessee, with winds estimated up to 100 mph in some areas.

A home east of Highway 56 south of Gene Vaughn Road suffered severe wind damage, with the front porch and much of the roof blown off. One person inside the home was injured. Debris from the home was blown into fields over 250 yards to the east and northeast.

These storms produced several instances of severe wind gusts as they traversed the Texas South Plains, in addition to a wall of dust followed by heavy rains and minor flooding. As this squall line decayed after sunset, additional storms fired along its outflow from the southeast Texas Panhandle through the Rolling Plains. One of these storms east of Childress produced a dust storm that contributed to a fatal multi-vehicle accident near Kirkland.  After midnight, a small line of showers and some thunderstorms redeveloped over the western South Plains and moved south. Although radar indicated very weak precipitation intensities with this line, a macroburst and possible heat burst developed shortly after 0230 CST on July 4th and proceeded to strike the north and east sides of Levelland with fierce straight-line winds of 80-110 mph.  In addition to causing widespread wind damage, two vehicles were overturned by these winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A significant downburst with winds estimated as high as 110 mph struck the northern half of the city of Levelland causing widespread damage to buildings, trees, utility poles, and even rolling two cars from the road.  An NWS damage survey team determined the most intense winds were focused about 2.5 miles east of downtown Levelland.  It was in this area that a pole barn's metal support beams were ripped from their anchors and a car along State Highway 114 was blown off the road and flipped over.  The driver of the car was shaken, but not injured.  Damage elsewhere was consistent with winds of 70 to 90 mph and was comprised of peeled back roofs on some buildings and mobile homes, some street signs bent flat to the ground, many large trees snapped at their base, and even a trampoline wrapped around a power pole.  Three industrial buildings sustained substantial damage. Sections of streets were so cluttered with structural debris that front-end loaders were required to clear a safe path for travel. One man was injured as the awning he was grilling under collapsed and dragged him a short distance. Approximately 40 power poles were damaged leading to some residents being without power for 11 hours.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A large complex of thunderstorms moved southeast across southeast Missouri during the evening hours of the 29th. The storms occurred near a surface cold front which sagged southward across southern Missouri during the evening. This deluge of heavy rain brought flash flooding to the Ozark foothills.

This complex occurred along the same front, which moved back north as a warm front across southeast Missouri. These storms caused considerable flash flooding. They also accelerated rises in area rivers, which were already above flood stage in some cases. The rainfall total for the three-day period from April 28 to April 30 was 12.25 inches at Ellsinore in Carter County from the public. A public report of 12.01 inches was received from Old Appleton, near the Perry / Cape Girardeau County line. In Perryville (Perry County), a Cocorahs observer measured 9.87 inches. North and west of a line from Dexter to Sikeston, there were numerous reports of rainfall in the 5 to 10 inch range, including 9.60 inches at Williamsville (Wayne County), 9.21 inches at Patterson (Wayne County), 8.90 inches at Van Buren (Carter County), 7.76 inches at Marble Hill, 6.54 inches at Poplar Bluff, and 5.65 inches at the Cape Girardeau riverfront.

At the Poplar Bluff river gage, the river crested at 21.96 feet late on the morning of the 1st. This crest was only a few inches below the record crest of 22.15 feet, set in March of 2008. The main levee from Poplar Bluff to the Qulin area was under extreme stress. One section of levee broke in the vicinity of County Road 608, requiring eight houses to be evacuated. The levee was overtopped in more than a dozen spots. The part of the levee protecting Poplar Bluff, including the downtown area, was overtopped in a couple of places. Police and firefighters went door-to-door on the south side of Poplar Bluff advising residents of a levee breach just outside the city limits. Some homes in the flood plain were flooded, mostly in rural areas south of Poplar Bluff. Areas of south central Butler County were evacuated. A total of about 54 homes were damaged, and two were destroyed. About 10 businesses were damaged. A Red Cross shelter at the Black River Coliseum sheltered about 80 residents. There were two fatalities as a result of the river flooding. The first drowning victim was a 69-year-old woman, whose body was recovered from inside her vehicle on May 2 but who actually drowned on April 30. Her vehicle was swept off a county road outside of Harviell. The second drowning involved a 60-year-old man, whose truck was washed off Route 53 into a ditch near County Road 618.  Most area schools were closed during the crisis. Grain bins were flooded, though some of the crop was removed before the flooding could damage it. Numerous state and county roads were closed, including Highway 53. Parts of Qulin were flooded. Between Qulin and Neelyville, residents of the Coon Island area were evacuated.

The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries.

The last of the EF3 damage occurred on Old Lois Road where most of the roof of a brick home was removed. An add-on room on the back of the home was flattened by a massive live oak tree crushing two occupants to death in their bed.

The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries. Three days of damage surveys were conducted to rate the tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down in Clay County and moved northeast through the northwest corner of Calhoun County and into southern Randolph County. It caused extensive tree damage with nearly every tree in its path snapped through the Clay and Calhoun portions of the track. In addition, it flipped a mobile home in Clay County, injuring one person who was inside. The tornado caused major roof damage in Clay and Calhoun counties removing the roofing structure from two homes. It also caused minor roofing damage to several homes in all three counties.  This tornado was rated EF2 with max winds estimated at 125 mph.  Damage cost was estimated.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries. Three days of damage surveys were conducted to rate the tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down in Clay County and moved northeast through the northwest corner of Calhoun County and into southern Randolph County. It caused extensive tree damage with nearly every tree in its path snapped through the Clay and Calhoun portions of the track. In addition, it flipped a mobile home in Clay County, injuring one person who was inside. The tornado caused major roof damage in Clay and Calhoun counties removing the roofing structure from two homes. It also caused minor roofing damage to several homes in all three counties.  This tornado was rated EF2 with max winds estimated at 125 mph.  Damage cost was estimated.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries. Three days of damage surveys were conducted to rate the tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is a continuation of the northeast Brooks county tornado.  The tornado then continued into Cook County. Still at EF-3 strength, it swept about 35 manufactured homes into a pile of rubble at the far end of the Sunshine Acres mobile home park. Seven people lost their lives. The tornado then went on to destroy about two thirds of a brick home on Val Del Road, collapsing in two walls and removing most of the second story. Another home built of concrete blocks was destroyed. A nearby farm had several concrete anchors for a large metal structure pulled from the ground.  Max winds were estimated near 140 mph.

Three walls collapsed and the roof was heavily damaged and shifted halfway off the remaining rear wall. At this point, the tornado had its strongest winds, estimated to be around 110 mph. The rating was capped at a high end EF1 due to the lack of damage or much less significant damage to structures immediately around the store. There were also five people injured inside the Advanced Auto Parts store, and at least 5 cars were heavily damaged from the front wall of the store falling on them. The tornado continued to do very sporadic and more minor damage as it moved north of Highway 21, finally terminating at the Port of Savannah-Garden City.

This couplet |was well defined on the Houston Hobby terminal doppler radar which spun up quickly|along the north side of strong westerly outflow winds from the initial couplet that was responsible for two earlier weak tornadoes near and in parts of La Porte. This tornado was witnessed to start near the railroad tracks near Highway 146 and it tracked east southeastward across the Barbours Cut Port Facility and parts of Morgans Point. Much of the more significant damage was to industrial areas around the Port complex. Large steel storage tanks were bent inward from the wind, and many large, metal shipping containers were toppled over. The tornado lifted near the eastern end of Morgans Point near the Ship Channel.

During the late-afternoon and evening, storms continued to progress eastward and develop over Northwestern Wisconsin. One supercell developed a long-track tornado that traveled 83 miles from 5 miles south of Clayton, WI to 13 miles southeast of Hawkins, WI. This is likely the longest single tornado track in Wisconsin since records began being kept in 1950, as a couple events in May 1953 were very likely multiple tornadoes. There were also numerous reports of very large hail, up to 3 inches in diameter that occurred in a long swath from southwest to Amery, to near Cameron. ||Based on damage assessments through the state of Wisconsin, the total number of residential homes affected in Barron County alone was 160. Of those affected, 75 had minor damage, 45 had major damage, and 40 were destroyed. Total estimated damages were 5.1 million dollars. The total number of businesses affected in Barron County was 6. Of those, 2 had minor damage, and 4 were destroyed. Total estimated damages were 5.0 million dollars. This includes six barns at a Jennie-O turkey farm, located off of Highway SS and north of Highway OO near Chetek's Prairie Lake Estates mobile park, where some were destroyed. There were approximately 25,000 birds lost in the tornado.||In Rusk County, the total number of residential homes was 27. Of those affected, 21 had minor damage, 3 had major damage, and 1 was destroyed.

In Barron County, the tornado hit numerous farmsteads, devastating barns and other outbuildings.  The hardest hit area in Barron County was just north of Chetek, WI, where high-end EF2 damage was found. A number of mobile homes were completely demolished, and this is where the one fatality occurred. After that, several turkey barns were leveled, and then multiple homes were hit hard near Prairie Lake, especially those on the eastern shore.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Law Enforcement reported the tornado just south of the county line near Pawnee Rock and then followed it as it moved to the NE.  The tornado moved through the west side of Pawnee Rock causing sporadic EF1 and isolated EF2 damage to several homes and one school type facility.  The tornado continued to move to the NNE causing EF2 damage to a couple of homes on West Barton County Road.  One residence was a mobile home that lost the far east side of the structure and all roofing material.  One injury was noted at that location as they did not seek shelter.  The home just to the west lost the east half of structure with the occupants seeking refuge in the basement.  Of note, a Ford F-150 was thrown or rolled approximately 75 to hundred yards away from its original location.  Further to the NE, the tornado strengthened considerably as noted by complete destruction of an 1890 farm house.  With the age of the home and no anchoring being present due to the structure resting on cinder blocks along with a lack of debarking, a higher rating could not be justified though the amount of devastation to the structure itself pointed towards a possible higher rating.  Three occupants sought refuge in the basement and were unharmed.  The next door neighbor's home was also considerably damaged with all of the structure being demolished except for one corner section. The tornado then continued to the NE over open country damaging trees and power lines along the way before dissipating NW of Hoisington. A total of 44 parcels were affected. Ten homes were deemed total losses.  The estimated property value losses were estimated at $658,000.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 658.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado traveled northeast and impacted a house which sustained roof damage. On the other side of the road, two single wide mobile home trailers were overturned.  Damage at this location was rated high end EF1.  Farther to the northeast, more substantial tree damage occurred.  Several mature trees were topped, split and snapped at various heights above the ground.  The surrounding structures sustained corresponding roof, siding and fascia damage.  Damage was also rated high end EF1 along this portion of the track.  The tornado continued northeast and crossed Illinois Route 99 and caused additional minor tree damage.  The tornado moved northeast through the far northeast portion of town causing additional EF0 tree, roof and fascia damage to structures.

The evening event impacted a larger proportion of the ArkLaMiss, and brought wind damage as well as large hail and a strong tornado.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado began along Purvis-Oloh Road, about 5 miles west northwest of Purvis. It tracked northeast across portions of Lamar County causing mainly tree damage, uprooting and snapping softwood and hardwood trees. It caused some minor to moderate structural damage as well. The tornado crossed Old Highway 11, continuing to cause mainly tree damage, although at least a few structures were also damaged. The tornado began to gain strength as it reached Slade Road, where some homes received roof damage. As the tornado crossed Sullivan Kilrain Road, additional homes received significant roof and structural damage, especially on Carter Circle and Tatum Camp Road. Comprehensive assessments from Lamar County emergency management officials count 26 homes in the county being destroyed or with major damage and 52 homes receiving minor damage. The tornado continued to gain strength as it crossed into Forrest County. There it struck a subdivision along Nellwood Drive, Lakeland Drive and Crestwood Drive and caused significant damage to many homes. Several homes received significant roof and structural damage. One home sustained significant damage and also was the site of one of the fatalities. As the tornado continued to track northeast, it caused extensive tree damage and powerline damage. It struck a church along Helveston Road, which suffered damage to the top floor. As the tornado approached William Carey College, it intensified to EF3 strength, causing damage to numerous buildings on campus. The tornado then affected a mobile home park, downing trees and causing damage to mobile homes. Here, two more fatalities occurred. It then caused structural damage to several homes, churches and businesses on James Street and Alcorn Road. Another fatality occurred on Alcorn Road, when a tree fell on a home. The tornado continued to track northeast, crossing the Leaf River and headed into Petal. Here the tornado got very wide and continued to cause EF2 type damage to businesses along Main Street and into the neighborhoods on the southern side of the city. Extensive tree damage occurred and countless homes had minor to major roof damage in the neighborhood south of Hillcrest Loop. As the tornado reached Sun Circle, it intensified to EF3 strength again and caused significant damage to a few homes as well as moderate damage to many homes in the neighborhood. Beyond the subdivision along Sun Circle, the tornado caused tree damage again before reaching Evelyn Gandy|Parkway. It caused structural damage to an AT&T store by lifting the roof of the strip mall. It caused additional roof damage to several homes and a church along the Parkway as well as along Springridge Road and Corinth Road. As the tornado tore across Shawnee Trail, it caused impressive tree damage, which included snapping and uprooting hardwood and softwood trees. As the tornado tracked just south of|HDR Lane, it took down two metal electrical transmission lines. The tornado then destroyed a house along Macedonia Road, as well as causing additional roof to other homes and taking down numerous trees. Additional impressive tree damage occurred along Old Richton Road and Tyroby Lane. The tornado continued to down trees as it|tracked across Old Richton Road into Perry County. Comprehensive assessments from Forrest County emergency management officials count 499 homes in the county being destroyed or with major damage and 632 homes receiving minor damage.||The tornado path length in just Lamar and Forrest counties was 24.2 miles, although the entire path of the tornado in total was 31.3 miles.

The tornado quickly became violent, reaching EF-4 intensity and leveling five homes just west of Interstate 55, about 3.5 miles northwest of Perryville. Numerous unoccupied cars from a salvage yard were blown into or over Interstate 55. The lone fatality occurred when a southbound vehicle on Interstate 55 was intercepted by the tornado.

Maximum wind speeds were estimated near 180 mph in the vicinity of Interstate 55 and also near U.S. Highway 61. The damage path showed multiple vortex characteristics with ground striations and scarring to bare ground.

All twelve tornado injuries occurred in Perry County, where the tornado was at its strongest. At least one couple was trapped in their basement until rescuers removed debris. As the tornado approached the Mississippi River, multiple ground striations were noted in a farm field, indicative of multiple vortices. The maximum path width was over one-half mile shortly before the tornado crossed the Mississippi River into Randolph County, Illinois.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms developed over northwestern Oklahoma and south central Kansas during the evening hours and moved east into northeastern Oklahoma during the late evening hours of the 5th and early morning hours of the 6th. The thunderstorms evolved into a nearly solid line by the time they reached northeastern Oklahoma and resulted in widespread damaging wind. Very strong low-level wind shear ahead of the line allowed for the development of several areas of rotation along and within the leading edge of the thunderstorms. Several tornadoes formed from these low-level circulations, including a strong tornado that resulted in severe damage across portions of the City of Tulsa.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado developed over a neighborhood east of S Harvard Avenue and south of E 36th Street S, where large tree limbs were snapped and homes were damaged. The tornado moved east-southeast crossing S Yale Avenue where numerous trees and power poles were snapped. Numerous businesses were damaged or destroyed between S Yale Avenue and S Sheridan Road along and within a few blocks of E 41st Street S. Some of the worst damage in the path was in this area. Some of the businesses in the area had the roofs blown off the structure and some had exterior walls blown down. Several vehicles were rolled in this area, and reportedly 30 people were injured there.

Thunderstorms developed over northwestern Oklahoma and south central Kansas during the evening hours and moved east into northeastern Oklahoma during the late evening hours of the 5th and early morning hours of the 6th. The thunderstorms evolved into a nearly solid line by the time they reached northeastern Oklahoma and resulted in widespread damaging wind. Very strong low-level wind shear ahead of the line allowed for the development of several areas of rotation along and within the leading edge of the thunderstorms. Several tornadoes formed from these low-level circulations, including a strong tornado that resulted in severe damage across portions of the City of Tulsa.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado developed over a neighborhood east of S Harvard Avenue and south of E 36th Street S, where large tree limbs were snapped and homes were damaged. The tornado moved east-southeast crossing S Yale Avenue where numerous trees and power poles were snapped. Numerous businesses were damaged or destroyed between S Yale Avenue and S Sheridan Road along and within a few blocks of E 41st Street S. Some of the worst damage in the path was in this area. Some of the businesses in the area had the roofs blown off the structure and some had exterior walls blown down. Several vehicles were rolled in this area, and reportedly 30 people were injured there. Numerous other businesses sustained mainly roof, wall, and window damage between S Sheridan Road and Highway 169. Many power poles and trees were also blown down in this area.

Impressively strong atmospheric conditions led to very strong gradient winds ahead of the cold front. Later in the day a line of strong to severe storms pushed into central Kentucky. There were several reports of damaging winds along with 3 brief tornadoes which led to a few minor injuries.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This small tornado was embedded in a fast moving squall line that raced east at 55 mph.  The twister first touched down at a home on U.S. Highway 62 just west of Goshen Church Road, tearing off shingles and uprooting a tree.  It moved east-southeast, uprooting and snapping trees near the intersection of Hwy 62 and Goshen Church Rd, along with damaging some small outbuildings.  ||It next downed a tree on Mine Fork Road that fell between a home and outbuilding, damaging both structures and causing a |minor head injury to the occupant of the shed. Continuing over open fields, it next hit several residences along Hill, Mulberry, and South Mulberry streets before crossing U.S. Highway 231 and causing minor roof damage to the Post Office. ||The greatest damage occurred in this two block area, where up to a dozen outbuildings were destroyed or heavily damaged, and sections of roofing were lifted off homes and garages.

It moved east-southeast, uprooting and snapping trees near the intersection of Hwy 62 and Goshen Church Rd, along with damaging some small outbuildings.  ||It next downed a tree on Mine Fork Road that fell between a home and outbuilding, damaging both structures and causing a |minor head injury to the occupant of the shed. Continuing over open fields, it next hit several residences along Hill, Mulberry, and South Mulberry streets before crossing U.S. Highway 231 and causing minor roof damage to the Post Office. ||The greatest damage occurred in this two block area, where up to a dozen outbuildings were destroyed or heavily damaged, and sections of roofing were lifted off homes and garages.  Fences in the neighborhood were blown in a cyclonic pattern, providing evidence of the tight rotation pattern of the storm.  After crossing Hwy 231, the tornado damaged several large warehouses, scattering wood and sheet metal debris.  Along Bruce School Road, a chain link fence was flattened, and insulation was sucked out of the damaged roof of a two story home, then spattered along the east side of the home and adjacent vehicles.||Another large tree was uprooted in this yard before the tornado lifted.

The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries. Three days of damage surveys were conducted to rate the tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado was the first of two produced by the same thunderstorm that moved across South Georgia early Sunday morning. The tornado initially touched down just west of US-19 in Thomas County and then moved NE across mainly rural areas of the county. Damage was initially limited in the vicinity of US-19 to snapped and uprooted pine trees. The tornado began to strengthen and produced more significant damage near the vicinity of Crowley and Hall Roads where a home lost a significant amount of roof deck and numerous large trees were snapped and uprooted. Damage in this area was consistent with higher end EF-1 to lower end EF-2 intensity. As the tornado neared US-319 north of Thomasville, extensive areas of snapped pine trees were found along the damage path in some areas several hundred yards wide. Also in the vicinity was a mobile home that was completely destroyed. Damage in this area was consistent with lower end EF-2 intensity. The tornado continued across mainly rural NE Thomas County crossing Centennial Road where a double-wide mobile home was completely destroyed. Damage in this area was consistent with a EF-2 tornado. After this point, damage was mainly limited to significant tree damage along the path,  though some structural damage occurred to the NW of Pavo before the tornado crossed into NW Brooks County. Damage along this section of the tornado was rated EF-1.  Max winds for the tornado were estimated near 120 mph. Damage cost was estimated.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries. Three days of damage surveys were conducted to rate the tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado was the first of two produced by the same thunderstorm that moved across South Georgia early Sunday morning. The tornado initially touched down just west of US-19 in Thomas County and then moved NE across mainly rural areas of the county. Damage was initially limited in the vicinity of US-19 to snapped and uprooted pine trees. The tornado began to strengthen and produced more significant damage near the vicinity of Crowley and Hall Roads where a home lost a significant amount of roof deck and numerous large trees were snapped and uprooted. Damage in this area was consistent with higher end EF-1 to lower end EF-2 intensity. As the tornado neared US-319 north of Thomasville, extensive areas of snapped pine trees were found along the damage path in some areas several hundred yards wide. Also in the vicinity was a mobile home that was completely destroyed. Damage in this area was consistent with lower end EF-2 intensity. The tornado continued across mainly rural NE Thomas County crossing Centennial Road where a double-wide mobile home was completely destroyed. Damage in this area was consistent with a EF-2 tornado. After this point, damage was mainly limited to significant tree damage along the path,  though some structural damage occurred to the NW of Pavo before the tornado crossed into NW Brooks County. Damage along this section of the tornado was rated EF-1.  Max winds for the tornado were estimated near 120 mph. Damage cost was estimated.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado lifted just east of Abbeville. The tornado caused significant damage along the track, resulting in 5 fatalities in Albany. Severe tree damage was observed along the entire path which was up to 1.2 miles wide. In many spots, 90 to 100 percent of the trees in the path were uprooted or snapped. In Dougherty County, the tornado touched down on Tarva Road. By the time it reached Newton, the tornado was approximately 1.25 miles wide. There was extensive tree damage and some minor to moderate damage to a few homes in this area, consistent with EF2 damage. The tornado moved through the Radium Springs area, destroying nearly every tree in its path and causing EF2 damage to several houses. Most houses in this area had significant damage from falling trees. The tornado then moved through several mobile home parks just west of U.S. 319, destroying many mobile homes and causing the 4 fatalities. Damage consistent with an EF3 tornado was observed just east of U.S. 319. The tornado caused a large portion of a warehouse at the Proctor and Gamble Plant to collapse and tossed several semi-trailers across Mock Road. Additional EF3 damage was observed at the Marine Corp Logistics Base, where multiple anchored double-wide trailers were completely destroyed. In addition, several concrete light poles were snapped near the base, and a large solid concrete building had its solid concrete roof shifted more than 2 inches. A well-built concrete block church on Sylvester Rd was demolished with only parts of a few walls remaining. The estimated wind speed at this point is 150 mph, the highest analyzed along the track. EF3 damage was also observed on Harris Road where a cement block church was destroyed.

The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries. Three days of damage surveys were conducted to rate the tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The EF3 tornado from Dougherty county continued all the way across Worth county into Turner county as an EF3 tornado with max winds estimated near 150 mph.  In Worth County, it caused extensive damage to homes along Jewel Crowe Road. This was consistent with EF3 damage. Damage to homes and outbuildings consistent with EF2 damage was observed along Camp Osborn Road. A concrete block church on Zion Church Road was completely destroyed, justifying an EF3 rating at that point.

A cold front was moving southeast across the state and entered our northwestern|counties around sunrise. The strength of the cap was sufficient to hamper any development until mid afternoon. Deep forcing for ascent approached from from the west while remnant boundaries associated with convection over far East Texas and West Louisiana moved in from the east. By 3:30 PM, several parameters came together for the rapid development of severe storms east of Interstate 35/35E. Pre-frontal convection led to the development of supercells, producing numerous tornadoes over a relatively small area. Additional storm development quickly developed along the cold front with several reports of large hail, and eventually producing a brief EF-0 Quasi-Linear Convective System (QLCS) tornado (Tornado #7). ||The survey crew teams determined yesterday that there was a nearly 55 mile damage swath, yet found evidence that there were two tornadoes which caused the damage. One tornado began in western Henderson County and moved into central Van Zandt County. This tornado occluded and dissipated, and a second, long track tornado began nearby. This second tornado was the EF-3 which produced damage on the east side of Canton, Fruitvale, Emory, and finally dissipating near Lake Fork. The first tornado had|a track of approximately 12 miles, while the other had a track of nearly 42 miles. ||It is known that four people lost their lives due to these tornadoes, and 59 people were injured.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Henderson County tornado continued into Van Zandt County. A National Weather Service damage survey crew found the start of tornado number three began in Henderson County, approximately 3 miles due south of Eustace. This tornado eventually moved into Van Zandt County, where the storm produced EF4 damage. In  Henderson County, several homes suffered EF2 damage, along with a considerable amount of tree damage and damage to farm buildings. As the storm moved into Van Zandt County, the tornado  grew to a mile wide at the tornado's maximum width. Over 50 homes were either damaged or destroyed, with a continuous path noted between counties.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 700.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado continued into Naplate and produced widespread EF2 damage to numerous homes. EF3 damage also was identified in two locations. The first was where a minivan was thrown about 30 yards and a home was lifted off its foundation and left with only its interior walls intact. The second was at the Pilkington Glass plant where one section of the factory was completely destroyed. The tornado then crossed the Illinois River and moved through the south side of Ottawa, producing an 800 yard wide path of EF1 damage to trees and homes. The fatalities in Ottawa occurred from a tree falling onto two men who were working outside. The tornado then crossed the Illinois River again and continued to produce EF1 and EF0 damage as it exited Ottawa, finally dissipating in the area northwest of Marseilles.

There were seven tornadoes confirmed in the NWS Chicago county warning area.  Large hail was reported in numerous areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The first area of significant damage in the EF2 range was in the area around the La Salle County Nursing Home and La Salle County Highway Department, with lighter damage upstream from this location. The tornado continued into Naplate and produced widespread EF2 damage to numerous homes. EF3 damage also was identified in two locations. The first was where a minivan was thrown about 30 yards and a home was lifted off its foundation and left with only its interior walls intact. The second was at the Pilkington Glass plant where one section of the factory was completely destroyed. The tornado then crossed the Illinois River and moved through the south side of Ottawa, producing an 800 yard wide path of EF1 damage to trees and homes. The fatalities in Ottawa occurred from a tree falling onto two men who were working outside. The tornado then crossed the Illinois River again and continued to produce EF1 and EF0 damage as it exited Ottawa, finally dissipating in the area northwest of Marseilles.

The cold front gradually progressed across the Ohio Valley and thunderstorms initiated and swept east ahead of the front.

A rain gauge network in Mill Creek Township measured an instantaneous rainfall rate of over 7 inches per hour around 630 pm. The storms produced a measured 3.85 inches of rainfall  in the Erie/Mill Creek area. The intensity of the rainfall ultimately overwhelmed storm drainage systems causing significant overland flooding. In Mill Creek some roads were reported to have as much as five feet of water with numerous water rescues conducted. Some structures sustained damage and the Mill Creek Fire Department had to evacuate. The most significant damage occurred in on East 30th Street in Erie where a basement wall collapsed from the water pooling on the outside, trapping and ultimately drowning two residents. The flooding was likely exasperated by the poor drainage, but ultimately it was the torrential nature of the rainfall that caused the damages.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 270.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The line intensified as it approached the Mississippi River and caused wind damage and tornadoes. As the convective system evolved into Mississippi, numerous tornadoes developed along the advancing line, with the most prolific damage occurring along the track of a large meso-scale convective vortex (MCV). This feature tracked roughly from Claiborne County through western Hinds/Madison, eastern Yazoo, eastern Holmes, southeastern Carroll, Montgomery, and northwestern Webster counties. This corridor is where the most significant damage occurred, as well as one fatality. Flash flooding, hail, and other wind damage occurred as these storms moved through.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A person was struck by lightning as they were getting inside their truck.

Isolated, high-based supercell thunderstorms erupted first near the U.S. Highway 83 corridor from Childress south to Aspermont, with even more intense supercells occurring later over the western South Plains. Some of these storms produced giant hail of 3 to 4 inches in diameter causing severe damage to crops, buildings and vehicles. Cities hit especially hard included Childress, Amherst, Littlefield, and Anton where combined property damages may exceed $10 million with regional agricultural losses approaching $50 million.  Toward midnight CST, individual storms grew more linear over the southern South Plains before exiting southeast of the region before daybreak on July 1st.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the continuation path of the devastating supercell that moved slowly southeast along U.S. Highway 84 from Lamb County. Wind-driven hail as large as baseballs shattered home windows, destroyed siding, punctured roofs, heavily damaged vehicles, wiped out crops, and stripped trees across far northeast Hockley County.  The mayor of Anton described the hail damage as the worst he had ever seen in decades of living on the Texas South Plains and declared a state of disaster. The American Red Cross said 100% of the roughly 400 homes in Anton sustained serious damage, with each home requiring on average $6,000 of repairs.  One resident of Anton was bruised by the large hail and cut by broken glass as he attempted to cover up shattered windows during the storm.  About 8,000 acres of crops in extreme northeast Hockley County were a total loss from the hail, torrential rainfall and flooding that ensued.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
