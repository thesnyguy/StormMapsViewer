The associated rain resulted in flash flooding over saturated soils in southwest West Virginia.  The Coal River at Tornado in Kanawha County rose to around its 25 feet flood stage during the predawn of the 19th.

Repetitive showers formed, as dew points of 60 to 65 degrees fed the system from Kentucky.  The heaviest rain rates came toward the end of this prolong period, mainly from 1530E to 1730E, with rates peaking around an inch per hour.  South of the training showers, across Logan and Mingo Counties, the heavy rain was more sudden, the result of the last shot of enhanced rain during the late afternoon.  The heaviest rain totals ran west to east, from Wayne County and southern Cabell County, through northern Lincoln County, central Kanawha County, southern Clay County, and into central Nicholas County.  Branchland's rain total was 4.7 inches.  Hamlin measured 4.4 inches.  The National Weather Service office at Ruthdale had 4.1 inches.  Mount Nebo measured 3.8 inches.  The 3.66 inches at Charleston was the 5th heaviest 24 hour total on record, for any month of the year.   Richwood observed 3.4 inches.  Clendenin and Clay both measured around 3.1 inches.          Severe flooding occurred along streams feeding into the Mud River in Lincoln County, including the Straight Fork.  Homes and businesses around Hamlin were also flooded.  Damage assessment In Lincoln County counted 35 homes destroyed, 80 with major damage, and 80 with minor damage.  The Griffithsville Elementary School was flooded and sustained heavy damage.  It was closed and will not likely reopen.  Duval High School had minor damage.  There were about 20 swift water rescues in the Duval area.  One rescue was an unusual example.  An Army National Guard black hawk helicopter was in the air, practicing night rescues near Parkersburg.  When the request came in for help, the crew raced 65 miles south to Lincoln County and rescued 3 people from a flooded truck.   The Griffithsville Post Office had several feet of water inside.In Kanawha County, one of the hardest hit drainages was Davis Creek, which flows from Kanawha State Forest through Loudendale to South Charleston.  The main branch of Davis Creek, plus its Middle Fork were hit harder, compared to its Trace Fork.  One Loudendale resident said, "It's flooded, but never this bad."  Some homes had 3 feet of water inside.  A 62 year old male drove into the flooded creek around 2000E on the 12th.  Apparently, he had stopped his car for about 5 minutes in the road, since the local fire department had the road barricaded.  Then, it appeared the man was going to turn around in a parking lot, but instead drove between a house and a small store, and into the swollen creek.  His body was recovered the next day, inside the vehicle, about a miles down the stream.  Two South Charleston firefighters rescued a woman along Davis Creek.  One firefighter said, "She was hanging onto a tree limb.  She was hanging on for dear life.  The only thing sticking out of the water was her head and her arm."   Other flooded areas in Kanawha County included Campbells Creek, Georges Creek at Malden, Witcher Creek and Winifrede hollow, plus the Rabol-Broundland-Olcott Roads.  Inside the city limits of Charleston, a woman was rescued after having her body pinned by flood waters against the lip of a culvert.  This occurred along Lick Branch and South Ruffner Road.  The city emergency director described the street as a "rushing river."   In Kanawha County, 44 homes were destroyed, 150 had major damage, and 88 homes had minor damage.   Several private bridges were also destroyed.The crest on the Mud River in Cabell County occurred around 1300E on the 13th, flooding homes and businesses in Milton.  Milton Middle School was damaged.  Damage assessment counted 8 homes destroyed with major damage to 52 and minor damage to 56 dwellings.                     Further east, in Webster and Nicholas Counties, numerous roads were flooded, but damage to homes was less.  Yet, this rain event would set up the town of Richwood and much of this area, for more severe flooding a week later.In Wayne County, most of the damage was in the Dunlow area.  In Logan County, Garrett Fork and the Sharples area flooded.  In Mingo County, the East Fork of Twelvepole Creek saw flooding.  Besides the flood on the Mud River, the Coal and Elk Rivers saw minor flooding.  Crests on the Elk and Coal Rivers would be even higher the following week.This event initiated a federal disaster.  See FEMA disaster #1500.  More counties would be added to the declaration, after the flooding on the 19th into the 20th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 6.6M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Lowland flooding occurred along the East Fork White River in Jackson County.  The White River in southern Indiana rose to bankfull levels.  This was the result of the melting snow cover.With warm air over Indiana, a storm system brought 2 to 4 inches of rain to much of central and southern Indiana from the 1st through the 3rd.  Because of the saturated soil conditions, widespread local flooding occurred in central and southern Indiana.  The major rivers in the state were flooding by the 4th. Another storm system quickly followed from the 4th through the 6th. This storm system tracked across southern Indiana and brought 2 to possibly 5 inches of rain to central and southern Indiana.  Because much of this rain fell as freezing rain just north of Indianapolis, two very significant weather events occurred; a major ice storm and flood.Major flooding resulted along the White, East Fork White and Wabash River in southern Indiana.  Flood levels that had not been seen in 40, 50 or more than 90 years occurred just south of the Indianapolis area.  New record stages were set at the White River at Edwardsport and the Wabash River at Mount Carmel.  The White River at Hazleton approached its record stage.Flooding in southern Indiana was much worse than the January 1991 flood.  Areas affected in the January 1991 flood were affected again and more severely.  These included Shelbyville, Rushville, Seymour, Wheeler Hollow, Bedford, Shoals, Spencer, Elnora, Edwardsport, Petersburg area, Hazleton, East Mount Carmel and New Harmony.  Numerous state roads and local roads flooded by several feet.  Many local agricultural levees were overtopped.As this flood unfolded, cold air behind this storm system shut off the rain but left several inches of snow covering central and northern Indiana on the 7th and 8th.  Flooding fighting in southern Indiana occurred during rather harsh January conditions from the 7th through the 10th.  Milder conditions returned on the 11th.Some of the significant events during this flood include:Columbus, a large city in southern Indiana, had only one access road to I-65 causing long traffic delays.   Sandbagging efforts to save a power substation that served much of Rushville.A flood fight in Shelbyville to keep the Big Blue River from portions of the town.At least 70% of Jackson County was flooded.  Evacuations occurred in Rockford, Shields and Brownstown area.A levee failed along the Eel River in the Jasonville area.  Flood waters rose to within 10 inches of a power box for the Jasonville water system.  Power was shut down and the town lost its water until flood levels receded.Spencer lost wastewater treatment service.  This closed nearly all the restaurants in town.  Flood waters were within 2 ½ blocks of the Owen county courthouse.Flood waters at the Columbus wastewater treatment plant reached so high that employees were evacuated.  The plant was operated by the automated system for 12 hours.Personnel of the Indiana National Guard waged a major flood fight to save the Hazleton levee that protected nearly ½ of the town.  At times the levee partially failed but was reinforced.Personnel of the Indiana National Guard sandbagged at State Road 64 to protect East Mount Carmel, Indiana.  Sandbagging occurred on the Illinois side near Rochester.Potential major problems at the Edwardsport Power Plant on the White River were averted.Coal shipment to a major power plant in Gibson County was threatened by high levels on the Wabash River.  The situation was monitored closely.Local Sandbagging in the Elnora area saved several homes.While major flooding was spreading throughout southern Indiana, central Indiana experienced extensive flooding on the White River from Muncie through Indianapolis and the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes.  Sandbagging was necessary in Anderson and Ravenswood areas.   The warmer temperatures on the 11th began to melt the snow and ice that covered central and northern Indiana.  An additional 1 to 4 inches of rain fell in much of central Indiana late on the 11th.  This caused flash flooding in portions of Delaware, Madison, Tipton and Howard Counties.  The most serious flooding was in the towns of Alexandria and Kokomo.  Significant flooding occurred in Albany and Eaton.  Flooding returned to the White River in central Indiana as a result of the rain on the 11th.   After reaching a crest, the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes began to rise again.  January 12 was the warmest and one of the driest days in the New Year.  Temperatures in central and southern Indiana soared into the 60s.  Mild conditions were short lived.As cold air pushed through Indiana on the 13th, an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain fell in central and southern Indiana.  This rain caused widespread local flooding.  Major flooding developed along the White River in Hamilton and northern Marion Counties.  Flood levels approached those of January 1991 in this area.  Evacuations occurred in the Ravenswood area.  Some homes had their power turned off because of high water levels.Major flooding developed on the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes as a result of the rain on the 13th.  Flood levels in the Lafayette and Covington areas reached their highest levels since July 2003.  Flooding from Montezuma to near Vincennes was the highest since June 1958.As this major flood crest was moving downstream along the Wabash River, flood fighting occurred under very brutal conditions.  Temperatures fell below freezing late on the 14th.  Snow of 1 to 4 inches fell in much of eastern Illinois and central Indiana on the 16th.  Temperatures dropped below zero on the 17th and 18th in the Hutsonville and Vincennes areas.  Temperature moderated to more normal levels by 19th.Areas along the Wabash River most severely flooded included, Montezuma, Clinton, Taylorville and Riverview in Indiana and Darwin, York, and Hutsonville in Illinois.  Flood waters overtopped many local agricultural levels.  Flood waters affected the cemetery at Palestine, Illinois. As the Wabash River approached record levels at Hutsonville, the Island Creek levee across from the Hutsonville Power Plant failed during the late evening on the 17th.  The level of the Wabash River fell 5 inches immediately in the town of Hutsonville.  Daylight revealed the levee breach was 300 to 500 feet wide and covered 5,000 acres of farmland with 7 to 8 feet of flood waters.  This breach damaged State Road 154 between Hutsonville and Grayville.  Now a short 5 mile drive for local residents was a 70 mile one way journey. The breach of the Island Creek levee caused the Wabash River to crest immediately at Hutsonville and very soon afterwards at Riverton.  The river crested at Vincennes within a day after the levee failure.  Water flowing back into the river from the area protected by the Island Creek levee caused another crest at Riverton and Vincennes.  This level was slightly lower than the crest after the breach.Rain on the 11th and 13th fell as the rivers were near crest in the Petersburg, Hazleton and Mount Carmel areas.  The combination of rain and very cold temperatures hindered flood fighting in these areas.  By the 13th the rivers crested at Petersburg, Hazleton, Mount Carmel and New Harmony.  Flood waters would continue to recede for the remainder of January, although at times very slowly. The flood crest at New Harmony was the highest since January 1950.Another crest followed the major flood that had occurred along the White and East Fork White Rivers in much of southern Indiana.  This crest was 2 to 3 feet lower on the White River from Centerton to Edwardsport.  On the East Fork White River this crest was more than 8 feet lower in the Columbus and Bedford areas and 1 ½ feet lower at Seymour.  These crests washed out as they approached Petersburg.  The great flood of January 2005 began to wind down at all locations on the 20th.  Mother Nature had thrown every type of severe winter weather at the residents in the Wabash River Valley. Upwards of 30 inches of snow and 12 inches of water had fallen during the prior 30 days.By the end of January flooding had ended everywhere in the Wabash River Valley except for lowland flooding along portions of the Wabash River.  Millions of dollars in flood damage had occurred since the beginning of winter.  The great flood of January 2005 was the most extensive in areal coverage for Indiana since March 1913 and possibly unprecedented.  At least 4,000 homes and businesses flooded and more than 7,000 people displaced.  One person died while attempting to cross the extensively flooded Wabash River in Warren County.Crests on the major rivers in central Indiana were as high as 15.5 feet above flood stage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A man attempted to cross a bridge over the swollen Wabash River and was swept to his death.  It was after dark, and water was over the road approaching the bridge.  It is believed that the man crawled through the car window in an attempt to get to safety and was swept away by the strong current.  The search was called off on 12 January to wait until the waters receded, due to the hazardous nature of the search.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

To the south of the boundary, dew points were in the 50 to 55 degree range.  The heaviest rain amounts were from Perry County on north and east into eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania.  Preliminary 5 day totals were 5.2 inches for New Lexington, 4.6 inches at McConnelsville, 4.5 inches at Nelsonville, 4.2 inches at McArthur and Beverly, 3.4 inches at Athens, and 2.9 inches at Marietta.  Small stream flooding started during the morning hours on the 5th, across Perry, Athens, Morgan, Vinton, and Washington Counties.  Some of the flooded streams included Jonathan Creek in northern Perry County, plus Monday and Sunday Creeks in southern Perry County and northern Athens County.   Sunday Creek crested at 15.8 feet on the 6th at Glouster, and near 23 feet at Millfield.  On Monday Creek, the gauge at Doanville crested at 19.1 feet on the 6th.  In Perry County, 9 families were evacuated.  The small stream flooding across Vinton County was limited to flooded roads.  Significant river flooding occurred on the Muskingum, the Hocking, and the Ohio River.  The crest on the Hocking River at Athens was 23.7 feet around 1100E on the 7th.  This was the highest level since the 24.65 feet observed on the 25th of May in 1968. It was the highest stage since the river was rechanneled in 1972. The crest level was also the 5th highest on record for Athens.  Communities such as Nelsonville and Chauncey were flooded.  The lowest and most vulnerable sections of Chauncey had water inside dwellings and other buildings.  In Athens, the storm drainage system backup into the business area along East State Street.  Some homes on Blick Avenue were flooded.  West Union Street was also flooded and closed.  Elsewhere in Athens County, the high water along the Ohio River affected Hockingport.  All total, about 73 homes in Athens County had minor damage, 56 homes had major damage, and 11 homes were destroyed.  About a dozen businesses applied for disaster loans.In McConnelsville of Morgan County, the Muskingum River crested at 13.45 feet around 1400E on the 6th.  This was the highest level since the 13.8 feet seen back in March 1964.  Water rescues were performed by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the county sheriff department.  An 85 year old woman was rescued from her flooded mobile home along the Muskingum River on the 6th.  She did not want to evacuate earlier and had her pets inside.  When finally rescued, she was sitting on a chair, with water almost up to her knees.  Her feet were swollen.  She never recovered from the hypothermia, and died several days later.   A second crest would occur less than a week later, from additional rain and dam releases.  See the 12th for details.  In Morgan County, around 142 homes had minor damage.  One furniture store in McConnelsville had flood waters inside.     In Washington County, small stream and river damage was less severe than in September 2004.  The Ohio River crested at 41.0 feet at Marietta 2SW during the predawn hours of the 8th.  The crest was 42.4 feet the previous September.  Flood stage is 34 feet.  Downtown Marietta streets and businesses were still flooded, but sandbags protected most 1st floors.  Further down the Ohio River, Racine Lock and Dam crested at 48.9 feet.  The crest at Pomeroy was 50.5 feet around 0000E on the 9th.  Flood stage is 46 feet at Pomeroy.  Back in September 2004 the crest was 51.2 feet.  Water still got into businesses.  All total, Meigs County had 17 homes with minor damage, 2 homes with major damage, and 3 homes destroyed.  Five businesses had major damage and 1 business was destroyed.     The crest near Gallipolis, at the RC Byrd Lock and Dam was 50.3 feet around 1400E on the 9th.  This was just over the 50 foot flood stage.  For the Chesapeake to South Point reach of the river, the Huntington gauge crested at 51.8 feet during the evening hours of the 9th.  This was about 6 inches higher than in September 2004.  Flood stage at Huntington is 50 feet.  Around 0845E on the 6th, just north of the Belleville Lock and Dam, the tugboat Jon Strong was heading up the Ohio River.  After passing through the lock chamber, 9 of the 12 barges came loose in the strong currents.  Three of barges sank under the gates of the dam, while 3 others were forced up against the dam pier houses.  Three other barges went through the structure and were recovered downstream.  Salvage crews did not remove all the damaged barges until the last day of the month.  Since the gates could not be closed, the pool above Belleville Lock and Dam dropped 10 to 15 feet below normal.  River traffic was suspended on the 19th.  River bank slippage occurred around Hockingport during the unusually low levels late in the month.  This caused damage to roads and a few homes. Water levels returned toward normal in early February.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The relatively warm air ahead of the storm raised snow levels and rain fell on an already deep snowpack and resulted in the second costliest natural disaster in state history. An estimated $300 million in damage was reported from flooding along the Santa Clara and Virgin Rivers in Washington County. One man was killed in the flooding near Quail Creek Reservior and three people perished in avalanches. The Virgin River water level reached a 25-year high and the Santa Clara River rose above any previously recorded level. 30 homes were destroyed as the Santa Clara changed course and cut through a portion of the community. Approximately 20 more homes were significantly damaged during this record flood event. This storm system also brought heavy and wet snowfall to elevations above 8000 feet. Many avalanches occurred throughout the state following the storm. A large avalanche killed a snowboarder in Ephraim Canyon. East of Mount Pleasant, a slide took the life of a snowmobiler. Some of the higher snowfall and water equivalent totals include: Cedar Breaks 70" and 10.70" water, Kolob-Zion Park 60" and 8.70, Alta 58 and 9.13, Solitude 55 and 9.71, Brian Head 51, Laketown 47 and 3.67, Snowbird 32 and 5.46, Randolph 32 and 2.18, The Canyons 31 and 3.55, Long Valley<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several urban areas had significant street flooding.  The Sacramento weir was opened for the first time since 1997 with twenty gates opened.  - Transportation throughout the area was difficult during the course of the storms as airports were closed due to the high winds and major road closures resulted from flooding and mudslides.  Interstate 80...the main artery between Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay area...was closed near Fairfield in Solano County for several hours due to severe flooding.  Additionally, Interstate 80 eastbound between Sacramento and Reno, NV, was closed for more than a day due to a massive mudslide, as was both directions of U.S. Highway 50 between Sacramento and South Lake Tahoe.- The primary weather impacts were due to flooding.

The worst flooding occurred along the Raritan and Passaic River Basins. It was the worst flooding in the Raritan Basin since Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Bound Brook and Manville were once again hit hard as were communities on the other side of the Raritan River in Middlesex County. Along the Passaic Basin, Lincoln Park also was hit hard. The nor'easter also brought strong to high winds as well as some snow to the state on the 16th. Numerous streams and rivers flooded, but the flooding along the Delaware River was minimal.  |Statewide damage was estimated at $180 million dollars. It was the second worst rain storm (not related to a hurricane) in the state's history. Acting Governor Richard J. Codey declared a state of emergency on the 16th. About 5,000 people were evacuated in 11 of the state's 21 counties. At one time over 70 major roadways and interstates were closed including New Jersey State Routes 20, 23, 38, 46, 70 and 73 as well as U.S. Route 30 and Interstates 80 and 380. There were over 700 traffic accidents indirectly caused by the flooding and heavy rain. Three people in the state drowned. The strong winds caused about 120,000 homes and businesses in the state to lose power. Power was not completely restored until the 18th. The combination of the snow, wind (power outages) and flooding caused many school districts to either cancel classes or have delayed openings on the 16th. Even Rutgers University was closed on the 16th and 17th. In the Raritan Basin, school closings lasted into the week of April 23rd. The nor'easter was so nasty that even the Internal Revenue Service extended the tax deadline for 48 hours in affected areas. The heavy and flooding rains was expected to delay the spring planting on farms. Garden center and nursery business which was already slow because of the unseasonably cold weather was dealt another set-back. Twelve counties in the state were declared federal disaster areas and included Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris and Somerset Counties.   |Rain began falling throughout the area during the late evening on the 14th. It started briefly as snow over some of the higher terrain of Susse County. The rain fell at its heaviest from about 3 a.m. EDT on the 15th to about 3 a.m. EDT on the 16th. As the upper air disturbance moved across New Jersey, the rain did change to snow for a couple of hours around sunrise on the 16th and accumulated about an inch or two on grassy areas in western New Jersey. The steady precipitation ended during the afternoon and early evening on the 16th. Event precipitation totals averaged 3 to 6 inches. Event snowfall totals were an inch or two in most areas, mainly on grassy areas. |The strongest winds occurred as the nor'easter pulled northeast of the region on the 16th from the early morning into the afternoon. The combination of the heavy rain, even some snow and the winds helped knock down numerous trees and power lines. Peak wind gusts averaged between 40 and 60 mph.|The nor'easter low pressure system initially formed in the southern Rockies on the 12th and moved to Arkansas on the morning of the 14th. At 8 p.m. EDT on the 14th, there were two low pressure systems, one in Kentucky and the other in western Alabama. The southern low pressure system became the predominate one overnight and at 8 a.m. EDT on the 15th, it (996 millibar low) was located in western North Carolina. As the 15th continued, it moved northeast and intensified rapidly. At 2 p.m. EDT the nor'easter (989 millibars) was near Raleigh, North Carolina. At 8 p.m. EDT, the nor'easter was a 979 millibar low pressure system near Virginia Beach, Virginia. Another low pressure system formed on its warm front during the afternoon over Chesapeake Bay and at 8 p.m. EDT it (982 millibars) was over extreme southwest New Jersey. The lows consolidated into one again overnight and a very intense 973 millibar low pressure system was located over Monmouth County, New Jersey at 2 a.m. EDT on the 16th. At 8 a.m. EDT on the 16th the nor'easter was down to 968 millibars and located over New York City. That was a drop in central pressure of 28 millibars in 24 hours which qualified it as a meteorological bomb (a drop in central pressure of at least 24 millibars in 24 hours) low pressure system. The nor'easter bottomed at a pressure of about 966 millibars (28.53 inches) at 11 a.m. EDT just south of Long Island, New York. To put into prospective how low the pressure was with this nor'easter, that central pressure is near the border of the pressure defined category 2 and category 3 hurricane once used on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. As the 16th continued, the nor'easter weakened and meandered across southwest New England and the New York and New Jersey coastal waters. By 2 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the nor'easter's central pressure rose to 988 millibars and a second storm formed on the triple point of its fronts south of Nova Scotia. This became the main low pressure system. The low pressure system then slowly moved southeast over the next couple of days. The heaviest precipitation fell as the low pressure system was rapidly intensifying on the 15th into the early part of the 16th. The strongest winds ceased after the low pressure system started to fill on the afternoon of the 16th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> In Middlesex County, nearly every municipality suffered flood damage or had roads closed due to flooding. Many major roads were flooded including U.S. Routes 1 and 9 and New Jersey State Routes 18 and 27. Nearly 1,000 people were evacuated and 129 homes suffered severe damage. A 52-year-old man drowned in Woodbridge after he drove his vehicle into a flooded underpass (Leesville Avenue). The three other family members in the car were able to be saved.

This intense low in combination with high pressure over eastern Canada produced Overview: An area of low pressure intensified rapidly as it moved slowly from the southeastern United States on the morning of Sunday, April 15th to near New York City by the morning of Monday, April 16th.  The intense low over New York City in combination with high pressure over eastern Canada produced a very intense pressure gradient across the area which caused strong east to northeast winds to develop across the region.  Over land, the strong winds downed numerous trees.  The downed trees caused widespread power outages, especially near the coast, and numerous road closures.  Over the marine areas, the strong winds caused a storm surge and large ocean waves of up to 30 feet to develop.  The combination of astronomical high tides, storm surge, and large waves contributed to coastal flooding in coastal areas of the state and severe coastal erosion in areas south of Portland.|The storm also brought heavy rain to the region which, when combined with snow melt, produced widespread flooding across much of the region.  The flooding of small rivers and streams was worst in southern and coastal areas and led to numerous road closures.   In the mountains, the rain was preceded by heavy snow.  Flooding was minor on most mainstem rivers, however, in southern Maine, the Presumpscot River reached near record levels. |The intense low drifted very slowly eastward from Monday morning through Friday morning as it gradually weakened.  During this time, the pressure gradient slowly relaxed, the winds gradually diminished, and the seas slowly subsided.  However, rain continued into Tuesday across the region and each high tide during the period brought a reoccurrence of coastal flooding and erosion to the area.  Power outages persisted, and stream and river flooding continued across the region during this period.  Many roads remained closed.|On Friday, April 20, high pressure built eastward from the Great Lakes ending the influence of the Atlantic storm.  |  |Wind: The pressure gradient associated with the storm brought high winds to the region.  The damage observed in the hardest hit areas was typical of wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph.  While most observing sites reported winds below this range, topography, elevation, and exposure were likely factors in determining the amount of wind damage any location experienced.  In addition, the heavy rain brought strong wind gusts to the ground level and contributed to the sporadic nature of the heaviest wind damage.  In addition to the meteorological factors, damage from the wind was exacerbated because of the heavy rain that accompanied the wind and the soft, wet ground caused by the spring thaw.|The wind knocked over numerous trees and branches throughout the region and caused numerous and prolonged power outages throughout the region.| |Coastal Flooding/Storm Surge/Waves:  The coastal storm hit during a period of very high (and very low) astronomical tides.  In addition to the astronomical tides, the prolonged period of strong northeast winds caused a prolonged storm surge along the coastline.  Also during this period, the strong winds caused large and battering waves along the coast.  The storm tides and large waves caused significant flooding and coastal erosion. |In Portland, flood level is 12 feet.  During the storm, storm tides reached or exceeded the 12 foot flood level during 7 tidal cycles.  In addition, due to the large waves, coastal erosion occurred throughout the week of April 15th to 20th when the Portland gauge was above or near the 12 foot flood level.  Communication was lost with NOAA���s Portland Weather Buoy shortly after 6 am Monday when it was reporting 31 foot seas.|Precipitation:  Rain developed across the southern part of the state early Sunday afternoon, April 15th and spread northward.  The rain became heavy during the afternoon and overnight.  By Monday morning, 3 to 7 inches of rain had fallen in York County with rainfall amounts decreasing to 1 to 4 inches to the north and east.    In the mountains of Maine, 2 to 7 inches of snow fell by Monday morning.  Although the heaviest precipitation fell from Sunday afternoon into Monday afternoon, precipitation persisted into Tuesday.  Rainfall in Southern Maine was near the 100 year recurrence interval at Sanford and Eliot.|Flooding:  The heavy rain combined with snow melt to cause flooding of small rivers and streams in much of southern and central Maine.   The worst flooding occurred on the smaller rivers in York County.  Damage to infrastructure was severe (roads, bridges, waste water treatment plants, public buildings). Homes and businesses were also damaged. In York County, two people were killed when they attempted to cross a flooded road on foot and were swepted away.

Numerous water rescues were conducted around the county. Marble Hill was described as cut in half by severe flooding of Crooked Creek, which rose 8 to 10 feet above a major state highway into town. Much of Marble Hill was inundated. Schools were closed, businesses shut down, and campgrounds were evacuated. Many gravel roads were washed out, and many small bridges were destroyed. Initial estimates were that 75 percent of the county's roads were damaged. The emergency management director for the county reported 14 businesses and 15 homes in Marble Hill suffered severe damage. Fifteen homes in Glenallen and 30 homes in Zalma were severely damaged. A school and other public buildings were extensively damaged.

Large clusters of thunderstorms produced very heavy rain. A cold front moved southeast into the Lower Ohio Valley during the night, preceded by more thunderstorms. These storms produced a report of wind damage and a tornado. Rainfall for the 24-hour period ranged from 2 to 4 inches across most of western Kentucky, with isolated amounts of 4 to 7 inches.

The child was a passenger in a vehicle driven by her mother. The vehicle plunged into about eight feet of water that was over the road at a creek crossing. The vehicle immediately began floating, and both the mother and child exited. The mother lost her grip on the child, and the child immediately went under water. A boat was used to locate the child within ten minutes. Rescue workers retrieved the child, who was caught up in debris or tree limbs in about eight feet of water. The child was given CPR and rushed to a local hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The area is known to flood by local residents, and it was marked by an orange high water sign. The mother was new to the area and likely unfamiliar with the flooding problems there. About 5.5 inches of rain had fallen the night before the drowning. Countywide, numerous roads were covered with water. Several roads were closed for a few days, including Highway 120.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The flooding affected many municipalities island wide.  The torrential rainfall resulted in severe flooding to rivers, streams, and roads, causing sinkholes, land/mudslides, and structural collapses mainly across the southern half of the island.  Specifically, the heaviest rainfall, and most severe effects, occurred across the municipalities of Cabo Rojo, Guayama, Humacao, Patillas, Ponce, and Yabucoa, where in some locations, totals approaching 30 inches of rainfall fell in a three-day period, ending at 8 am Tuesday, September 23, 2008.The heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding were a direct result of a large tropical disturbance that moved slowly west across the island.  On occasion, tropical disturbances may develop into tropical depressions and, upon further intensification, get named by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) as a tropical storm and/or hurricane. While the National Weather Service (NWS) in San Juan and the NHC closely monitored the system for possible organization into a named storm, multiple reconnaissance flights flown through the disturbance revealed no closed, low-level, surface circulation, which was needed to satisfy the definition of a tropical depression.  It was not until 5 pm Thursday, September 25, 2008 when the system, located about 380 miles north northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico, was named Tropical Storm Kyle. The strongest effects of the tropical disturbance were first felt in Puerto Rico on Sunday, September 21, 2008.  The most intense rainfall occurred in the 24-hour period starting at 8 am Sunday, September 21, 2008 through 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008, with the highest rainfall rates occurring during the overnight hours from sunset on Sunday to sunrise on Monday.  The largest rainfall amounts for the 24-hour period ending 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008  were 22.03 inches in Patillas, 20.00 inches in Guayama, 16.00 inches in Cabo Rojo, 14.83 inches in Yabucoa, and 10.81 inches in Ponce.  For the combined three-day period, some of these numbers increase further with 29.83 inches in Patillas, 21.86 inches in Yabucoa, 20.52 inches in Ponce, and 17.82 inches in Cabo Rojo.  Lesser, but just as significant, amounts, ranging from 5-15 inches of rain, fell across much of the island.  The torrential rainfall seen across the island was immediately seen across the extensive river network in Puerto Rico.  Some rivers, including the Rio Gurabo, saw water levels rise in excess of 25 feet in less than 12 hours.  Parts of the island that were spared the worst of the rain include the northern and northwestern coast, were only moderate rain showers were experienced.  The total rainfall amounts recorded from this event are unique in that the 29.83 inches seen in Patillas exceeds the weekly total rainfall of 27.13 inches measured in Juana Diaz during the October 1985 flood event.  The 24-hour rainfall totals ending at 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008, which encompassed parts of the southeastern section of the island, including the municipalities of Patillas and Guayama, exceeded 200-year 24-hour rainfall totals.  Specifically for Patillas, the recorded rainfall amount approaches the 500-year 24-hour rainfall totals.  Along the southwestern section of the island, Cabo Rojo���s 24 hour rainfall also exceeded the 100-year return period. Across the southern municipalities of Puerto Rico, Ponce and Yauco���s 24-hour rainfall rates exceeded the 10-year 24-hour rainfall totals, Juana Diaz exceeded the 25-year rainfall totals, and Yabucoa, along the southeast coast, exceeded the 25-year rainfall totals. The resultant flooding had considerable effects on the local population. Six fatalities were reported, three direct deaths due to drowning, and 3 indirect heart attack deaths related to stress induced flooding. An estimated 630 people in the affected areas were evacuated to shelters. In addition to structural damage caused by the flood waters, agricultural damage was sustained by coffee, plantains, and other minor crops, damage was preliminarily estimated at 23 million. In response to the significant flooding, federal authorities issued a disaster declaration for portions of the island.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flooding was reported in the following sectors of Ponce, La Lula, Highway 1 in front of Mercedita Airport, Madrigal, Barrio Los Chinos, and Barrio Tamarindo.

Some of the same areas heavily flooded during January were once again flooded to near record levels.  February flooding was more widespread and persisted longer than flooding during January.  One person was killed because he drove into  a flooded road.  Snowfall of up to 10 inches accumulated during the early days of February in northern Indiana and portions of east central Illinois.  This snow quickly melted by the morning of the 6th as temperatures rose into the 50s on the 4th and 5th.  Rain of 1 to 4 inches fell in eastern Illinois and much of Indiana on the 5th and 6th.  This combination of rapid snow melt and heavy rain caused extensive flooding of streams and rivers in central Indiana.  The heaviest rainfall was in the east central Illinois, northern Indiana, and eastern Indiana areas.  For the second time in 30 days, flooding approached record levels along the Tippecanoe River in northern Indiana.    The Wabash River approached a major flood from Lafayette to Vincennes.  Flooding along this portion of the Wabash River was the highest since January 2005.  Extensive flooding along the White, Eel, Muscatatuck, and East Fork White Rivers was the highest to date of the winter.  Flood damage along the Tippecanoe River was limited because many residents had not been able to repair January flood damage.  However, some flood damage did result to those who had begun repairs.  The number of people evacuated was much less as well because many homes were uninhabitable.  An agricultural levee south of Terre Haute was over toppled.  A few rural families had roads to their homes blocked by flood waters.  Sandbagging was necessary in the Montezuma and Clinton areas.  One person was killed during the evening of the 6th in Lawrence County.  He drove his vehicle into a road flooded by Indian Creek.  Numerous local roads and several state highways were flooded along Indiana's major rivers.  Flood lasted from a few days in many central Indiana locations to nearly four weeks along portions of the Wabash River in the Hutsonville area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flooding occurred along the East Fork White River in Jackson County, including near Seymour, due to heavy rain and snow melt.  A family of six was rescued from the flooded East Fork White River near County Road 150 East.  The family was taken to the medical center in Seymour for medical treatment after the incident.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Major flooding was noted in many other areas of north and central Georgia, including the eastern suburbs of Atlanta, northwest Georgia, and parts of central Georgia.  The culprit was a very stagnant upper atmospheric pattern featuring a weak upper low that developed in early September across south Texas and slowly migrated east-northeast through September 22nd, until a more significant upper trough dropping south into the southern plains finally moved the pesky upper low northeast of Georgia.  In addition, an unusually deep tropical flow was noted throughout this period.  Precipitable water values exceeded 2.0 inches across the area during much of this period, resulting in extremely efficient rain producing cells.  Persistent heavy rain showers and thunderstorms began to plague the area on the 16th, and persisted daily through the 21st across parts of north and central Georgia.||However, the catastrophic flooding unfolded when a sea breeze moving northwest merged with existing outflow boundaries and higher terrain across the western suburbs of Atlanta to result in persistent heavy thunderstorms for a period of at least 12 hours that trained across the same counties west of Atlanta, generally affecting Carroll, Douglas, Paulding and Cobb counties.  As the activity progressed across the state, significant flooding unfolded further east, including Fulton county, and the city of Atlanta, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties.  Incredible rainfall amounts of 15 to over 20 inches, were observed from northeast Carroll, through much of Douglas, into eastern Paulding and southern Cobb counties.  Rainfall amounts of 10 to 15 inches were noted across parts of Fulton, Dekalb, and Gwinnett.  Rainfall amounts of 8 to 12 inches were noted in other more spotty areas of northwest, north central, and central Georgia during this period.||The excessive rainfall on top of saturated ground resulted in some of the worst flooding ever reported in the Atlanta and north Georgia area.  Eleven deaths were recorded during the event, mostly vehicle related deaths at night from washed out bridges and roads as a result of swollen creeks.  Property damages are estimated to be at least $0.5 Billion, with hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed by flood waters.  Bridges on several state and local highways were washed out and some will take months to even a year to replace.   Eighteen counties (Bartow, Carroll, Chattooga, Cherokee, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Heard, Newton, Paulding, Rockdale, Stephens, and Walker) received a presidential disaster declaration as a result of the historic floods.  Twenty-one counties were declared eligible for public assistance, including several central Georgia counties that were affected by flash flooding earlier in the period.||Some of the worst flooding was observed along Sweetwater Creek near the Cobb, Fulton, Douglas county line.  Hundreds of homes were flooded and destroyed as the waters of Sweetwater Creek rose more than 20 feet above flood level.||Many main stem and secondary creeks, streams, and rivers across north and central Georgia, particularly in northwest and west central Georgia, reached record flood levels.

More than 40 roads across the county were completely washed out, including Post Road just south of Interstate-20.  A portion of Interstate-20 near Fairburn Road was closed for nearly 12-hours causing major traffic backups throughout the region.  The main line of the Norfolk-Southern railroad near Villa Rica was also washed out.  A seventh person in Douglas county fell victim to the raging flood waters.  A 29-year old female perished when she was swept away in her vehicle by flood waters from the Dog River at 451 am EDT.  Over 1200 residents in the county were left without power as several tress in water logged soils fell on adjacent power lines.  This primarily affected areas near and including Arbor Place Mall along Interstate-20 near Fairburn Road.  Schools throughout the county were closed because of many impassable and flooded roads.  Many homes, businesses, and roads across the county sustained tremendous damage.  Washed out bridges will result in some roads being closed for up to a year, including portions of Georgia Highway 166 near Campbellton.  Monetary damage to roads and property during this time frame was estimated to be close to $9 million.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8.70M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Major flooding was noted in many other areas of north and central Georgia, including the eastern suburbs of Atlanta, northwest Georgia, and parts of central Georgia.  The culprit was a very stagnant upper atmospheric pattern featuring a weak upper low that developed in early September across south Texas and slowly migrated east-northeast through September 22nd, until a more significant upper trough dropping south into the southern plains finally moved the pesky upper low northeast of Georgia.  In addition, an unusually deep tropical flow was noted throughout this period.  Precipitable water values exceeded 2.0 inches across the area during much of this period, resulting in extremely efficient rain producing cells.  Persistent heavy rain showers and thunderstorms began to plague the area on the 16th, and persisted daily through the 21st across parts of north and central Georgia.||However, the catastrophic flooding unfolded when a sea breeze moving northwest merged with existing outflow boundaries and higher terrain across the western suburbs of Atlanta to result in persistent heavy thunderstorms for a period of at least 12 hours that trained across the same counties west of Atlanta, generally affecting Carroll, Douglas, Paulding and Cobb counties.  As the activity progressed across the state, significant flooding unfolded further east, including Fulton county, and the city of Atlanta, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties.  Incredible rainfall amounts of 15 to over 20 inches, were observed from northeast Carroll, through much of Douglas, into eastern Paulding and southern Cobb counties.  Rainfall amounts of 10 to 15 inches were noted across parts of Fulton, Dekalb, and Gwinnett.  Rainfall amounts of 8 to 12 inches were noted in other more spotty areas of northwest, north central, and central Georgia during this period.||The excessive rainfall on top of saturated ground resulted in some of the worst flooding ever reported in the Atlanta and north Georgia area.  Eleven deaths were recorded during the event, mostly vehicle related deaths at night from washed out bridges and roads as a result of swollen creeks.  Property damages are estimated to be at least $0.5 Billion, with hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed by flood waters.  Bridges on several state and local highways were washed out and some will take months to even a year to replace.   Eighteen counties (Bartow, Carroll, Chattooga, Cherokee, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Heard, Newton, Paulding, Rockdale, Stephens, and Walker) received a presidential disaster declaration as a result of the historic floods.  Twenty-one counties were declared eligible for public assistance, including several central Georgia counties that were affected by flash flooding earlier in the period.||Some of the worst flooding was observed along Sweetwater Creek near the Cobb, Fulton, Douglas county line.  Hundreds of homes were flooded and destroyed as the waters of Sweetwater Creek rose more than 20 feet above flood level.||Many main stem and secondary creeks, streams, and rivers across north and central Georgia, particularly in northwest and west central Georgia, reached record flood levels.  Many of these same creeks, streams, and rivers remained in flood for several days.  In some cases, all time record flood levels were recorded.  The following is a list of new record flood levels set on several creeks, streams, and rivers in north and west Georgia.  Noonday Creek near Woodstock rose to 19.6 feet on the 21st at 530 pm EDT.

Alex was the first Hurricane in June for the Altantic Basin since 1995, and the strongest in the month of June since Hurricane Alma in 1966. Alex was a very large hurricane with tropical storm force winds extending over 200 miles from the center. Although Alex passed over 200 miles south of Corpus Christi, tropical storm force wind gusts were measured as far north as Port O'Connor, George West, and Cotulla. The strongest winds were observed on the barrier island from Port Aransas to Baffin Bay where peak wind gusts exceeded 60 mph.||Overall, the impacts to the Middle Texas coast were minimal. Storm tides peaked just below 4 feet mean sea level at tide stations along the coast producing flooding along area beaches. About a half dozen tornadoes occurred within the outer rain bands from Alex. These tornadoes caused mostly minor tree damage.

This started the runoff from a deep snow pack over the West Virginia mountainous counties.  A widespread 2 to 4 inches of water resided in the snow pack with some ridgetops exceeding 6 inches of water in the snow.  ||Flood concerns were high preceding the event, but mainly for the central and northern mountain counties of the state.  The deepest snow cover still resided across the high terrain in those counties.  Prior to the heavy rain, the snow cover over Fayette and Raleigh Counties had already melted away.  However, the ground was left soggy and primed to allow for a quick runoff.||Governor Manchin even declared a state of emergency before any rain arrived. ||An increasing southeast flow developed on Friday the 12th with dew points climbing into the mid and upper 40s.  The support for the showers was provided by a large mid and upper air low circulation, shifting east into the Tennessee Valley. |   |Showers developed early that evening, then moved northwest through the southern mountains of West Virginia into the Coal and Kanawha River Valleys.  A few thunderstorms were embedded within the heavier showers.  Training of these cells occurred in narrow bands oriented in an arch from southeast to northwest. ||Luckily, the heavy rain never transferred further north, where the mountain snow pack was still melting. ||In a 6 hour period ending at 0100E on the 13th, the Raleigh County Airport received 2.58 inches of rain, while Charleston had 0.80 inches.   By 0700E on the 13th, Beckley had a 3 inch rain total.   Oak Hill in Fayette County had 2.95 inches ending at dawn on the 13th.  The cooperative observer in Beckley measured 2.12 inches.  The Huff Knob automated rain gauge near Ghent measured 2.76 inches in the 12 hour overnight period.  On Tams Mountain, west of Sophia, another automatic rain gauge measured 2.1 inches in 12 hours.  Oceana of northern Wyoming County measured 2.3 inches.  Amounts around 2 inches in 12 hours were common through the Big Coal River Valley to around Charleston.  An unofficial spotter report of 3.6 inches was received just 1 mile southeast of downtown Beckley.  Further north, rain amounts around an inch reached into Nicholas County.  ||After dawn on the 13th, only spotty light rain lingered in the cooler air.  ||Major small stream flooding was widespread in Raleigh and Fayette Counties.  There were 2 direct fatalities from Raleigh County.  Flooding of less severity occurred in  Kanawha, Nicholas, Boone, and Wyoming Counties.  ||During the daylight hours on the 13th, the Kanawha and Coal Rivers rose rapidly and caused backwater flooding.  For example, the mouth of Paint Creek flooded in the Hansford and Pratt vicinity.  Later that night, the Coal River crested at 25.5 feet at Tornado, slightly over its 25 foot flood stage.  The crest on the Kanawha at Charleston was 29 feet, just under the 30 foot flood stage.||The American Red Cross served over 1000 meals and around 900 snacks in the affected flood zone.  They also distributed over 400 clean-up kits.  The Salvation Army and various church groups also came to the aid of the local citizens.  ||A federal disaster was declared that included Raleigh, Fayette, and Kanawha Counties.  See FEMA disaster number 1893 for more details.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Major stream flooding along such streams as Piney, Beaver, Little Beaver, Little Whitestick, and the headwaters of Dunloup Creek, including Maple Fork. Damage was less along the Marsh Fork and Clear Fork drainage in the western portion of the county. ||A 59 year old female turnpike worker was returning home from the evening shift.  She left her vehicle parked and attempted to walk through the flood waters of Maple Fork west of Bradley.  She was swept away and drowned.||The majority of the property damage in Raleigh County was along the urbanized Beaver Creek, Little Beaver Creek, and Piney Creek.  This would be in the vicinity of the communities of Beaver and Glen Morgan.  A stream gauge was located along Piney Creek upstream from the mouth of Beaver Creek.  The water level at this gauge rose from about 3 feet to a record high of 11.4 feet around 0430E on the 13th.||One resident along Beaver Creek said, I've lived here for 24 years and never seen anything like this.  Other residents along the lower reaches of Beaver Creek sought refuge in their attics and called 911 for help.  A swift water rescue team from the Glasgow Fire Department was working rescues along Beaver Creek.  The boat struck something in the water, lost its steering and crashed into a bridge.  The boat capsized, throwing 3 firefighters into the water.  Two were able to reach safety.  However, a 32 year old male firefighter was swept away.  His body was not found until the 19th along Piney Creek.  Beaver Creek flows into Piney Creek before emptying into the Kanawha River.       ||Many culverts under roadbeds could not handle the flow.  A few were completely washed out. ||Preliminary data indicated 29 homes were destroyed in Raleigh County, with major damage to 34 other homes.

Severe flooding in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, M��xico from June 30th through July 2nd, from an estimated 30 inches of rain in this area was a portent of future impacts on the Rio Grande during the weeks to come, lasting for much of July and the first third of August. ||Major flooding continued for nearly a month at Rio Grande City - and by proxy, southwest Hidalgo County - continuing through August 3rd! Flood conditions (50 feet or higher) continued a few days beyond, with levels dropping below flood stage on August 10th at Rio Grande City and just a little bit later in southwest Hidalgo County. In total, the river was likely in flood at points downstream in southwest Hidalgo County, from the morning of July 9th through at least August 10th - more than month. ||A number of small communities along the Rio Grande west of the Lower Rio Grande Valley Flood Control System were impacted by the sprawling river into early August, while releases remained at 60,000 cubic feet per second at Falcon International Reservoir until July 29th. These communities included locations in southwest Hidalgo County. The system of levees and floodways (spillways) downstream of Penitas (where improved levees begin along the river itself) largely worked as designed, containing and diverting water along the river and associated floodways extending through southern and eastern Hidalgo County into extreme northern Cameron and extreme southern Willacy County. However, additional water damage occurred to properties built inside the levees and floodways. Voluntary and mandatory evacuations were ordered for a number of threatened communities; as of this writing, no fatalities had been reported directly from the high waters. There were dozens of water rescues on the river through the period, many of them trans migrants attempting to cross from Mexico into Texas. ||On August 3rd, President Obama declared most counties in the Rio Grande Valley a Major Disaster, eligible for federal funding to assist with the longer term recovery. Deep South Texas Counties included Cameron and Hidalgo. Property and Crop damages from the flood may ultimately total well over $50 million when all assessments are completed. As of the end of July, property damage estimates in Hidalgo County had reached $22 million. Crops planted in flood zones were destroyed by the long duration of nutrient rich waters. Note: final damage cost estimated are provided in the July Storm Data report.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flooding of the Lower Rio Grande Valley Flood Control Project floodway/levee system (spillway), which includes the Banker Floodway (from near Granjeno to just south of Pharr), the Main Floodway (from just south of Pharr to the split at the Arroyo Colorado just southwest of Mercedes, the Arroyo Colorado itself, and the North Floodway, (which extends from near Mercedes to near La Villa before curving east to northwest Cameron County), continued through a good portion of August, as water continued to be diverted through Anzalduas for several days beyond the time that water was receding upstream of the dam.  Continuing water diversion helps reduce the potential for backwater flooding along the improved levee section (Penitas to Anzalduas) as well as unprotected shorelines west of Penitas.  At the same time, the diversion maintained several feet of water in the floodways for days to come which receded more slowly.  The floodway emptied out for the most part by August 15th, but local high water hazards continued through at least the 18th.   ||These floodways, protected by a robust system of levees and gates, protected communities outside of the levees by containing up to 50%, or 4 to 8 to feet of fast flowing water, within them into the first third of August.  Unfortunately, a number of residences, dozens of paved and unpaved roads with low water bridges, and some agriculture are located within  the floodways; significant damage was noted in several locations.  Pumping and plugging operations near Weslaco and La Villa successfully kept high water out of poor drainage locations where the potential for freshwater flooding due to heavy rains would have been exacerbated with periodic thunderstorms, which did not materialize in August.  Closed roads included  FM 493 and FM 1015, each moderately traveled; at least five homes were flooded along the Main Floodway south of Pharr along I Road; 15 to 20 homes were asked to voluntarily evacuate, and at least two other residences were flooded south of Weslaco near FM 88. Floodwaters also submerged portions of the Llano Grande golf course in Mercedes. ||Voluntary evacuations were finally lifted along I Road (Capote Farms subdivision) on August 18th at 6 PM CST, where the 15 to 20 homes mentioned above were located.  Wet, muddy conditions continued in these areas until the last week of August; damage assessments began on roadways and bridges impacted in the floodway after the waters finally receded.  In all, the floodways contained water for more than 6 weeks.||High flowing water along the river covered a large portion of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge (Santa Ana) south and southeast of Pharr, including a number of unpaved roads.  Damage to the roads was unknown at this time; the flooding occurred downstream of the Anzalduas Diversion Dam; river gages downstream at San Benito and Brownsville remained in action stage.  Floodwaters did not reach public or private structures, nor roadways, between the Refuge and the Main Floodway.  The water finally receded back to muddy pockets sometime between August 27th and 28th.||There was one reported fatality in early August; a man drowned after reportedly driving his vehicle accidentally into the fast flowing waters of the floodway late on August 1st or early on August 2nd. His body was found along the south side of the Main Floodway, near S. Jackson and W. Juan Balli Road just west of Pharr.  ||Several crops may have been destroyed by the flood along the Main and North Floodways, but damage was unknown as of this writing in this area.  Property and infrastructure damage may have exceeded [$10] million in these areas.

A persistent southerly low level jet brought very moist air into the area, which resulted in high rainfall rates. A coastal front along the I-95 corridor enhanced rainfall in that area. This event followed a heavy rainfall and record flooding event in mid-March as well as a second lesser rain event about a week prior. Rivers across much of Massachusetts and Rhode Island were still high from those events and warm temperatures in northern Vermont and New Hampshire resulted in a period of snowmelt, that resulted in rises on both the mainstem Connecticut and Merrimack Rivers. All of these factors led to a second record rainfall and flooding event. ||Two day rainfall totals across Southern New England ranged from an inch to ten inches. Though concentrated in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, all of Southern New England was affected by the flooding. In Massachusetts, two day rainfall totals ranged from one and a half inches on Cape Cod to nearly eight inches in Bristol County.  Providence, Boston, and Blue Hill Observatory in Milton, MA set record monthly precipitation totals during the month of March. Providence also set the record for the wettest month ever in the period of record. Both the Pawtuxet River in Rhode Island and the Sudbury River in Massachusetts set floods of record.  Nearly 1000 Massachusetts National Guardsmen were activated to aid in sandbagging and evacuations.  President Obama issued federal disaster declarations for seven counties in Massachusetts following the mid-March flooding.  After this second round of flooding, residents of the seven counties (Bristol, Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester) received an automatic extension for filing their state and federal taxes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Four to eight inches of rain fell across Bristol County resulting in several small streams rising above flood stage, including the Mill River in Taunton, the Canoe River at Norton, the Wading River at Norton, and the Segregansett River at Dighton, all of which set records.||Basements flooded in Taunton, North Attleboro, Attleboro, Norton, Mansfield, and Acushnet.  Numerous streets were closed due to flooding in Taunton, Fall River, Dartmouth, Norton, Dighton, Raynham, Somerset, North Attleboro, Attleboro, Freetown, Westport, Berkley, Mansfield, Rehoboth, and Swansea, including Route 6 in Westport, Interstate 195 at Exit 3 in Swansea, Route 24 in Dartmouth, and Route 140 in Freetown (exit 8).  The North Attleboro Town Hall sustained $350,000 worth of damage from flooding and Richards Memorial Library was closed for several weeks after the basement was flooded with water and sewage.  A pond at Capron Park Zoo in Attleboro overflowed, threatening zoo buildings.  It was able to be pumped out, keeping water out of most of the buildings.  One building was flooded with two feet of water, damaging boxes of gift shop items and supplies.||Route 44 on the Taunton/Raynham line was closed for the second time in a month due to flooding from the Taunton River.  An amphibious vehicle from the Boston Duck Tours was called into service to ferry residents from isolated neighborhoods to nearby supermarkets and pharmacies.||One bridge (Wheeler Street) was destroyed and three others damaged in Rehoboth when the Palmer River flooded.  Portions of two of the damaged bridges (Danforth and Elm Streets) were undermined and washed away and the Summer Street bridge sustained structural damage.  Two people were rescued when they fell into the Palmer River while trying to rescue their dog.  They were transported to Rhode Island Hospital.||Sixteen year round residents at the Canoe River Camp Ground in Mansfield were evacuated.  Three apartment buildings on Riverbank Road in Attleboro were completely surrounded by water overflowing from the Ten Mile River.  The Seven Mile River in South Attleboro overflowed its banks, flooding Pitas Avenue, isolating twenty homes.  Six structures in North Attleboro were evacuated because of flooding.||In hard-hit Fall River: Numerous roads were flooded, including Columbia Street and Mount Hope Avenue.  Storm water overwhelmed storm drains, blowing out of the manholes with such force that it ripped up pavement, gravel, and utilities.  Twenty nine homes lost power and gas service when the utilities were ripped up.  Bricks from sidewalks along Columbia Street floated down Canal and Columbia Streets, collecting in piles on Broadway and Anawan Street.  Doran Elementary School was flooded and the sewage treatment plant became overwhelmed with flood waters.  A vehicle became stuck in floodwaters, trapping the occupants.  Railroad tracks were under water at Interstate 195 and at Route 6.  The southbound lanes of Route 24 were closed from President Avenue to Route 195.  A 25 foot wide sinkhole developed on Jackson Street.  At least 300 people were evacuated from their homes.  The mayor declared a state of emergency.||In Freetown:  85 school-children were taken to a shelter after flooding made it impossible for buses to take them home.  The Assonet Bay Shores neighborhood (home to about 1000 people) was cutoff to regular traffic by floodwaters and the collapse of a Narrows Road/Causeway Road bridge.  Eleven students at the Crystal Springs School (a learning center for children and adults with learning disabilities) were stuck at the school for an evening after the bridge collapsed.  They were able to be transported back to the main part of the city when two mountain rescue vehicles owned by the state police were dispatched.  The vehicles remained in place for several days to transport residents between the neighborhood and the rest of the city.  A bridge 20 yards downstream from the Forge Pond Dam crumbled, leaving a four foot gap in Forge Road.  Fifteen households in Assonet Village were evacuated  as Forge Pond continued to rise.  Schools were closed early Tuesday, March 30 and for the day Wednesday, March 31 due to flooding.  ||There were three minor house fires in Mansfield that were the result of floodwaters reaching burners and electrical panels in basements.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 23.58M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This resulted in widespread rainfall totals of three to six inches.  In eastern Massachusetts, a strong southeasterly low level jet pumped ample moisture into the area, resulting in rainfall totals on the order of six to ten inches.  This resulted in major flooding across eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island, including small stream, urban, and poor drainage flooding.  In addition, the Concord River at Lowell, the Shawsheen River at Wilimington, and the Pawtuxet River at Cranston reached record flood stages within two to four days of the rain.  The Governor of Massachusetts declared a state of emergency and this was followed by a federal disaster declaration for seven Massachusetts counties.||Strong winds associated with the low pressure system and the low level jet affected both the east and south coasts, resulting in numerous downed trees and wires and some minor structural damage to a few buildings.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Several small streams rose above flood stage across Essex County, including the Ipswich River at Ipswich and South Middleton, the Shawsheen River at Andover, and the Parker River at Byfield.

Portions of Merrimack College in Andover were flooded, submerging trees downed by the wind.  Several cars were stranded in floodwaters, including one in Saugus at the Shaws parking lot, three on Woburn Street in Andover, and two on Foster Street in Peabody.  Several people were trapped in the cars in Peabody, but were successfully rescued.  Many streets in downtown Peabody were under four feet of water.  Collections at the Stevens Memorial Library in North Andover were damaged by floodwaters.||In Lawrence, a total of 50 homes on Willow Street, Exchange Street, and Myrtle Street were evacuated.  In addition, twenty eight people in the Holiday Inn Express on Winthrop Street were evacuated due to flooding in the hotel.  Approximately 25 three tenant homes along the Spicket River were evacuated.  The Carriage Hill Apartments in Amesbury were evacuated due to flooding from a nearby pond.  The Washington Park Condos and all 110 residents of the Marland Place Assisted Living Center in Andover were evacuated.||A 500 foot stretch of Route 62 in Danvers was closed when a fifteen foot deep sinkhole developed because of an underground culvert that was washed out after nearly eight inches of rain fell.  It reopened nearly three weeks later after work was delayed by a second major rainstorm.|A sewer treatment plant in Gloucester processed roughly 15 million gallons of wastewater during the storm, nearly 5 times capacity.  As a result, excess wastewater was combined with runoff and released into the harbor.||One fatality indirectly resulted from the flooding when a 49 year old man drowned while pumping water from his office.

Surface dew points were in the mid and upper 60s.  Wave after wave in the mid and upper levels helped trigger widespread showers, with embedded thunderstorms.  These training rains first affected Jackson and Vinton Counties between 0500E and 0600E on Sunday May 2nd.  The heaviest rains arched into Athens County and eventually sank slowly south, to affect Lawrence, Gallia, and Meigs Counties later in the day.||The rains continued into the evening hours on the 2nd, then diminished during the late evening.  However, some light rain lingered until after midnight on the 3rd.||The rain amounts over about an 18 to 20 hour period were mostly 3.5 to 4.5 inches across Lawrence, Jackson, Viinton, Gallia, Meigs, and Athens Counties.  Waterloo in northern Lawrence County reported 4.8 inches for the maximum.  McArthur in Vinton County and Jackson in Jackson County both measured around 4.3 inches.  The town of Athens had 4.1 inches, while Gallipolis had 3.9 inches, and South Point measured 3.8 inches.  An automatic gauge in Gallia County, between Gallipolis and Rio Grande measured 3.7 inches.||Small stream flooding was common.  Roads were flooded. Some small bridges and culverts were washed out.  Two men drowned near the Athens County line in Morgan County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Roads were flooded, but damage to dwellings was minimal.  Two brothers from Athens County died while on a fishing trip.  Their flooded vehicle was found along the East Branch of Sunday Creek above Burr Oak Reservoir.

This system brought scattered heavy-rain producing thunderstorms to eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.  For many areas it was the 3rd day-in-a-row with significant or heavy rain.  Many locations from central into northeast Nebraska received 3 to 4 inches or more rainfall in the 72 hours ending the morning of the 12th.  This additional heavy rain fell on saturated soils from rainfall prior to the 10th and prolonged, intensified or increased the coverage of flooding across eastern Nebraska and helped shift the flooding to larger rivers.  Flood damage over Nebraska in mid to late June amounted to at least 20 million dollars to public property alone and which did not account for damage to private property or crops.  The White House declared a federal disaster for 53 counties in Nebraska for June flooding.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Rainfall of at least 3 to 5 inches fell over much of the upper Elkhorn River basin in the week ending 7am 6/12.  This caused record or near record flooding along the Elkhorn River from around Clearwater and Neligh downstream to the Elkhorn's confluence with the Platte River.  The flooding was prolonged and intensified by additional rains the next few days.  In Madison county many gravel roads along the Elkhorn were flooded as were Highways 81 and 275 near and west of Norfolk which were closed for a while.  On 6/15 a railroad bridge just southwest of Norfolk washed away with 3 people on it that were assessing possible damage.  One person was drowned, the 2 others were rescued.  Another railroad bridge west of Norfolk and several sections of the Cowboy Trail bike trail was washed out.  A levee just south of Norfolk helped prevent major damage, but some damage was noted to businesses and nearly 70 homes on the south part of town despite sandbagging. In addition a park on the south side of town received extensive damage.  Farmland along the river sustained crop damage and had sand deposited on fields by the receding river.   The Elkhorn River near Norfolk reached a record crest of around 16.9 feet during the evening of 6/16, flood stage is 12 feet.  The river at Norfolk was above flood stage from the early morning hours of June 15th until mid evening on the 17th, although flooding likely started earlier upstream of the levee near Norfolk.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several locations in the Susquehanna Basin came close to records set by Hurricane Agnes (June 1972) and a few points (Bloomsburg, Hershey and Loyalsockville) set new floods of record. Flooding along Swatara Creek resulted in property damage and several deaths. Severe flooding occurred along Loyalsock Creek and many points along the main-stem of the Susquehanna River. The interaction of a stalled frontal boundary over the Mid-Atlantic region, a strong northern stream short-wave (with a persistent jet entrance region) and deep tropical moisture associated the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee resulted in multi-day, significant heavy rainfall event over Pennsylvania. ||Tropical storm Lee was the twelfth named storm of the 2011 season forming over the Gulf of Mexico on September 1. A strong northern stream short-wave interacted with Lee causing the storm to re-curve to the north-northeast. By 1200 UTC September 6, having undergone extra-tropical transition, post-tropical Lee was located over northern Georgia. The surface low weakened as it moved up the Appalachian Mountain chain. However, the strong low-level flow and the above normal precipitable water produced an extensive, north-to-south oriented band of heavy rainfall.||The rainfall associated with the remnants of Lee produced the 4th largest flood of record in the Mid-Atlantic Region. The five-day storm rainfall totals for September 5 to 9 were generally in the 5-8 inch range over the mid-section of central Pennsylvania and in the 8-12 inch range in the Susquehanna Valley region. There were local amounts reported in excess of 15 inches east of the Susquehanna River. The local climate sites in Harrisburg (KMDT) and Williamsport (KIPT) reported 13.44 and 9.03 inches respectively. On September 7, 2011 both KMDT and KIPT set their all-time daily (24-hour) rainfall for the month of September at 7.71 and 6.76 inches respectively. These sites later went on to break the all-time monthly (September) and annual precipitation records, making 2011 the wettest year on record.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Swatara Creek near Hershey crested at major flood stage, 26.8 feet.  Flood stage is 7.0 feet. Swatara Creek at Middletwon crested at major flood stage, estimated at 26.30 feet.  Flood stage is 11.0 feet.  This is the 5th highest all time.||The Susquehanna River at Harrisburg crested in major flood stage at 25.17 feet.  Flood stage is 17 feet.  This is the 5th highest crest on record.||While the Susquehanna River flooded a large area of Harrisburg, some areas were fortunate enough to escape the flood waters.  Midtown and Uptown residents were largely unscathed, though widespread power outages were reported.  The river levels crested several feet below that of Agnes, thanks in part to less contribution from the West Branch of the Susquehanna.||Between 8,000 and 10,000 residents were evacuated.  The Shipoke area of downtown reported significant flooding. City Island was also hard hit, with the baseball stadium under at least seven feet of water, prompting the double A baseball team to have to play its playoff games on the road.||Major damage was widespread in Hershey.  Hersheypark and ZooAmerica both reported major damage with 8 feet of water in low lying areas of Hershey Park.  Many structures were flooded and many roads suffered damage.  A ramp off of Route 322 near the Penn State Hershey Medical Center had a 3-foot deep trench cut across the road.  Swatara Creek cut a wide and devastating flood path.  Evacuations were noted in Palmyra, Derry Township and Middletown.||A 70-year old man died when a basement wall collapsed on him in Derry Township. He was pumping water from his flooded basement. A second man died in flood waters. While details surrounding his death are unknown, his mud covered car and body were found in Swatara Township several days after the flooding. A third man, 81 years old, drowned after his car was washed into Clarks Creek in Middle Paxton Township. Finally, a fourth victim, a 54 year old female, was swept away by flood waters. Her body was recovered weeks later in Swatara Creek.||Water rescues were widespread in Dauphin County.  One county rescuer was quoted, ���We were rescuing people on the way to rescuing people,��� Leonard said. ���There was no time for introductions or salutations. We were dispatched every 90 seconds for hours.���||Severe flooding occurred on Spring Creek.  House flooding, closed roads and water rescues using boats were conducted in Paxtang Borough and Swatara Township.  Three-quarters of all roads were flooded in Derry Township. Middletown on the mouth of Swatara Creek, where it enters the Susquehanna River also reported major flooding.  Five of the eighteen homes on Few Avenue were condemned from flood damage.  The basements of these homes were visible from the street through giant holes in the foundation.  Residents also reported a foul smell after the floods, with one resident saying, ���Imagine the contents of a septic tank mixed with diesel and fuel oil.���||A preliminary total of 295 buildings were destroyed, 1040 suffered major damage, and 1273 suffered minor damage with a total of 3348 structures impacted. Overall damage was estimated at $150 million.  In addition, 368 acres of crops were destroyed with an estimated value of $700,000.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid. The declaration was later extended throughout the state.||The highest wind gusts recorded during Hurricane Irene were 75 mph at Cape May Ferry Terminal (Cape May County), 69 mph in Harvey Cedars (Ocean County), 69 mph in Tuckerton (Ocean County), 68 mph in Cape May Harbor (Cape May County), 66 mph at the Atlantic City Marina (Atlantic County), 66 mph in Ocean City (Cape May County), 65 mph in Point Pleasant (Ocean County), 58 mph in Atlantic City (Atlantic County), 58 mph in Sandy Hook (Monmouth County), 58 mph in Brick (Ocean County), 57 mph in Keansburg (Monmouth County), 55 mph in Barnegat Light (Ocean County), 55 mph at Lakehurst NAS (Ocean County), 55 mph at Point Point (Atlantic County), 55 mph in Seaside Heights (Ocean County), 53 mph at Wildwood (Cape May County), 52 mph in Belmar (Monmouth County), 52 mph in Bivalve (Cumberland County), 52 mph in Trenton (Mercer County), 51 mph at Ft Dix-Wrightstown (Burlington County), 50 mph in Wantage (Sussex County), 47 mph in Mount Holly (Burlington County) and 42 mph in Somerville (Somerset County).||Peak storm tides included 9.75 feet above mean lower low water in Sandy Hook (Monmouth County). Severe tidal flooding starts at 8.7 feet above mean lower low water. This was the third highest tide on record and highest tide since the December 1992 nor'easter. Other peak tides included 6.96 feet above mean lower low water in Atlantic City (Atlantic County), moderate tidal flooding starts at 7.0 feet above mean lower low water; 8.55 feet above mean lower low water in Cape May (Cape May County), severe tidal flooding starts at 8.7 feet above mean lower low water; 8.03 feet above mean lower low water at Reedy Island, New Castle County Delaware, moderate tidal flooding starts at 7.2 feet above mean lower low water and 9.89 feet above mean lower low water in Philadelphia Pennsylvania, moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. Along tidal sections of the Delaware River, Big Timber Creek flooded along the Gloucester and Camden County lines and about 300 homes in Burlington City (Burlington County) had flooded basements.   ||Hurricane Irene formed east of the Leeward Islands on Saturday the 20th. It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.||Irene helped make August 2011 the wettest August on record for the state of New Jersey dating back to 1895. A new August monthly rainfall record of 16.10 inches was established in Trenton.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> In Pilesgrove Township, a 20-year-old woman was swept away by flood waters near the Salem River on U.S. Route 40 and drowned while driving her car early on the 28th. The combination of flooding rains and tropical storm force wind gusts closed forty roadways in the county. The collapse of the East Lake Road Dam in Woodstown flooded sections of the borough and Pilesgrove Township. In Pittsgrove Township, both Centerton and Palantine Lakes flooded. Half of Parvin State Park suffered wind and flood damage.  ||For the second time within the month, the Maurice River at Norma had major flooding and set the second highest crest on record.

The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid.

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th.

Moderate stream and river flooding occurred in the Poconos and Lehigh Valley and moderate to major river flooding occurred in southeast Pennsylvania. For many places in southeastern Pennsylvania, it was the worst creek and river flooding since Hurricane Floyd in 1999 or the remnants of Hurricane Jeanne in 2004. Flooding along non-tidal sections of the Delaware River was minor to moderate. There were two direct storm caused deaths: a wind related death in Monroe County and a drowning in Montgomery County.  About 500,000 PECO Energy and 420,000 Pennsylvania Power and Light customers lost power in Eastern Pennsylvania. For both utilities this ranked within the top five outages of all time.  Preliminary damage estimates were around six million dollars. In addition to property damage, the winds and rains badly damaged the corn crop in southeastern Pennsylvania. The Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area was closed through Labor Day Weekend (September 5th). ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread Eastern Pennsylvania during the evening of the 27th and persisted into the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread Eastern Pennsylvania during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest from during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 3 to 7 inches and caused widespread flooding. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate tidal flooding along tidal sections of the Delaware River overnight on the 27th. Minor tidal flooding occurred during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. | |In Stroudsburg (Monroe County), a 44-year-old man died when a tree fell on him in his backyard. He pushed his son to safety. Governor Tom Corbett declared a state of emergency for the city of Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs.

Three large shelters on the evening of August 27th in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia International Airport closed at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 27th and reopened on Monday the 29th. In Philadelphia, the storm left thousands without power. More than 500 trees fell in the city, seven buildings collapsed and twenty roads were closed. PECO Energy restored power by August 31st.||The highest wind gusts recorded during Irene were 57 mph in Mount Pocono (Monroe County), 53 mph in Allentown (Lehigh County), 52 mph at the Philadelphia International Airport (Philadelphia County), 48 mph in Reading (Berks County), 46 mph in Coatesville (Chester County), 45 mph in Northeast Philadelphia (Philadelphia County), 44 mph in Pottstown (Montgomery County), 44 mph in Newbold (Bucks County) and 40 mph in Quakertown (Bucks County). The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.89 feet above mean lower low water during the early morning of the 28th. Moderate tidal flooding begins at 9.20 feet above mean lower low water. ||Hurricane Irene formed east of the Leeward Islands on Saturday the 20th. It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th and then proceeded to the northnortheast and went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th.

At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.||Irene helped shatter all time monthly precipitation records. In Philadelphia, the 19.31 inches of rain established a new all-time August as well as monthly record. It was nearly half of the normal yearly precipitation total.

By March 23rd, several areas along the Minnesota River between the southwestern suburbs of the Twin Cities, to Mankato started to close. This included Highways 93 and 19 near Henderson, and Scott County Road 9 near Jordan. In addition, Lac Qui Parle, Yellow Medicine, Brown, Watonwan, Blue Earth, Sibley, Scott and McLeod Counties had several county roads closed or impassable by Wednesday March 23rd. ||A large storm system on March 22nd and 23rd dropped on average one half to 1.50 inches of liquid precipitation across the area. However, as much colder air began to move south on the 23rd, all of the precipitation switched over to snow.||By Wednesday, March 23rd, major river crossings in the Twin Cities began to close due to the flood waters; this included Highway 41 near Chaska and Highway 101 near Shakopee. In addition, more county roads started to close across southern Minnesota, and Highway 65 in Albert Lea shut down.||The last week of March, most of the Minnesota River and its tributaries had their first crests. However, a cold spell the last week of March, caused the rivers to fall or hold steady as the runoff from the snow melt abated.  ||Although ice jams were reported across the area, one ice jam on the Seven Mile Creek near St. Peter resulted in a fatality on March 22 when a MNDOT worker tried to clear the ice jam and his Backhoe tipped over and fell into the area where Seven Mile Creek flows into the Minnesota River.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Several highways and county roads from North Mankato, northward along the Minnesota River to Le Sueur, Minnesota were impassable due to Spring flooding.

In Crittenden County, the community of Tolu was threatened. In Livingston County, homes were threatened in Birdsville, and a few homes were surrounded by water in Ledbetter. Just west of Paducah, a 90-year-old man drowned (direct fatality) after he drove around barricades down a flooded secondary road. This incident occurred during the early afternoon hours of March 20, around 1 to 2 P.M. The victim could not see the edge of the road and ended up submerged in 12 feet of water in a ditch. Several people who tried to rescue the victim were taken to a local hospital for treatment of hypothermia. In western McCracken County, several homes were threatened, and they were protected with sandbags. All along the Ohio River, a number of roadways were closed. Most of the closed roads across the region were rural county and state roads. There was considerable flooding of low-lying fields and woodlands near the river. Riverside parks and recreation areas were flooded. Very few residences were flooded. The crest at the Paducah river gage was 47.81 feet, which was nearly identical to the January, 2005 flood and almost four feet lower than the 1997 flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Irene moved through the Caribbean and up the east coast of the United States making landfall twice. She first made landfall as a Category 1 Hurricane near Cape Lookout, North Carolina around 7:30am on August 27, then moved offshore again during the evening. She then made a 2nd landfall, again as a Category 1 Hurricane at 540am on August 28 near Little Egg Inlet in New Jersey. She moved over New York City and then into southeastern New York State and Connecticut as a Tropical Storm a few hours later. By the end of the evening of the 28th, Irene was crossing the U.S./Canada border having produced significant amounts of rain, storm surge, inland and coastal flooding, and wind damage across southern New England and much of the east coast of the United States. ||In Southern New England, the minimum surface pressure recorded was 976.9mb taken at Barnes Municipal Airport in Westfield, Massachusetts. The storm surge experienced along the coast was generally in the two to four foot range with a high of 4.78 feet at Fox Point in Providence, Rhode Island. The highest sustained windspeed was 54 knots (62 mph) at the Physical Oceanographic Real Time System station at Conimicut Light in Narragansett Bay, RI. The highest sustained wind speed on land was 38 knots (44 mph) recorded on the Automated Surface Observing Systems at both Barnstable Municipal Airport in Hyannis, MA (KHYA) and Logan International Airport in Boston, MA (KBOS). Rainfall amounts ranged from nearly zero (0.03 at Nantucket Memorial Airport - ACK) to nearly 10 inches (9.92 in Conway, MA). ||Despite the relatively low wind speeds, sustained winds over a 6 to 12 hour long duration resulted in widespread tree damage and resulted in power outages to roughly half a million customers throughout the state. Some of these customers did not get their power back until the Friday following the storm (some five days later). Durring the passage of Tropical Storm Irene, the winds resulted in $60M in property damages and inland flooding resulted in 1 fatality and $8M in property damages. ||Bunnell Brook in Burlington had its third worst flood on record.  The Farmington River reached its highest levels since Tropical Storms Connie and Diane in 1955.||The collective effects of Tropical Storm Irene on August 28, resulted in 1 fatality, 0 injuries, and $127.3M in property damage in the following counties: Barnstable, Bristol, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, Middlesex, Nantucket, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester (all in MA), Hartford, Tolland, and Windham (all in CT), Cheshire and Hillsborough (all in NH), and Bristol, Providence, Kent, Washington, and Newport (all in RI).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Four to ten inches of heavy rain from Tropical Storm Irene resulted in the Pequabuck River overflowing its banks.  This led to flooding on roads and homes along the river throughout Bristol.  Flooded roads ran approximately three and a half feet deep.  A 46 year old man went canoeing in floodwaters.  He drowned when his canoe capsized and he was unable to make it to shore.  At least 50 people were evacuated from areas around the river, and took shelter at Chippens Hill Middle School.  The river flooding undermined at least 7 feet of Route 72 eastbound, washing out this portion of the road.  Numerous houses and businesses were affected by the flooding.

Several locations in the Susquehanna Basin came close to records set by Hurricane Agnes (June 1972) and a few points (Bloomsburg, Hershey and Loyalsockville) set new floods of record. Flooding along Swatara Creek resulted in property damage and several deaths. Severe flooding occurred along Loyalsock Creek and many points along the main-stem of the Susquehanna River. The interaction of a stalled frontal boundary over the Mid-Atlantic region, a strong northern stream short-wave (with a persistent jet entrance region) and deep tropical moisture associated the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee resulted in multi-day, significant heavy rainfall event over Pennsylvania. ||Tropical storm Lee was the twelfth named storm of the 2011 season forming over the Gulf of Mexico on September 1. A strong northern stream short-wave interacted with Lee causing the storm to re-curve to the north-northeast. By 1200 UTC September 6, having undergone extra-tropical transition, post-tropical Lee was located over northern Georgia. The surface low weakened as it moved up the Appalachian Mountain chain. However, the strong low-level flow and the above normal precipitable water produced an extensive, north-to-south oriented band of heavy rainfall.||The rainfall associated with the remnants of Lee produced the 4th largest flood of record in the Mid-Atlantic Region. The five-day storm rainfall totals for September 5 to 9 were generally in the 5-8 inch range over the mid-section of central Pennsylvania and in the 8-12 inch range in the Susquehanna Valley region. There were local amounts reported in excess of 15 inches east of the Susquehanna River. The local climate sites in Harrisburg (KMDT) and Williamsport (KIPT) reported 13.44 and 9.03 inches respectively. On September 7, 2011 both KMDT and KIPT set their all-time daily (24-hour) rainfall for the month of September at 7.71 and 6.76 inches respectively. These sites later went on to break the all-time monthly (September) and annual precipitation records, making 2011 the wettest year on record.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Susquehanna River at Marietta crested in major flood stage at 58.16 feet.  Flood stage is 49.0 feet.  This is the 4th highest crest on record. The Conestoga River at Lancaster crested in major flood stage at 21.30 feet.  Flood stage is 11.0 feet.  This is the 2nd highest crest on record.||Life-threatening flash flooding affected a large part of western Lancaster County, inlcuding Elizabethtown, Manheim, Marietta and Columbia.||Mudslides, trapped motorists and flooded homes were widespread from Elizabethtown to Columbia in northwest Lancaster County.  Mount Joy and Marietta also experience major flooding.||At one point on the afternoon of the 8th, emergency dispatchers were handling more than a call per minute from stranded drivers and homeowners experiencing flooding.  The flooded roadways severely limited responders��� ability to reach those in need.  In Elizabethtown the only north-south road accessible was Mount Joy Road. A particularly dangerous water rescue occurred at 5pm when Maryland State Police helicopters rescued six motorists after their vehicles (large trucks) became disabled on East Main Street in Mount Joy. Multiple vehicles were stranded on Route 30 westbound at Prospect Road, west of Mountville. Mudslides closed parts of Route 441 and Elizabethtown Road. Most of the above mentioned Townships declared States of Emergency during this flood.  20 municipalities in total declared disasters. Cocalico Creek raged out of its banks during this event, flooding many locations in Ephrata Borough and Township.  At least 20 homes were condemned there, including an apartment building.  Water covered the bridge and all of Main Street.||Major flooding occurred along Chickies Creek in and near the Manheim area.  The southern side of Manheim was underwater from flooding along the creek, resulting in a significant number of structures flooding.   Route 72 was underwater from the creek.  At one point, cars were described as ���floating��� down Main Street in Manheim.  The Twin Kiss restaurant at Fruitville Pike and Main Street was partially submerged under about 4 feet of water.  Mayor Eric Phillips described Manheim as almost an island surrounded by rising floodwaters at one point during the storm. The Manheim Twin Kiss, a Manheim institution here for decades, had 3 feet of the water wash through it which toppled commercial refrigerators and other massive objects. In West Hempfield Township, a crew in boats helped a couple evacuate their home near Siegrist and Farmdale roads.||The 156 year-old Siegrist's Mill Bridge in Rapho Township was lost, as it was ravaged by flood waters from Chickies Creek on the afternoon of the 8th. During Agnes, the bridge shifted a few feet and was cemented back into place. Two other county-owned covered bridges, as well as two other conventional bridges, were closed for repairs because of the storm damage. They included Little Chickies No. 2 on Pinkerton Road, Little Chickies No. 4 on Drager Road, Big Conestoga No. 6, also called the Pinetown covered bridge on Bridge Road and Little Conestoga No. 1 on Shreiner Station Road.||Flooding along the Susquehanna was also reported in the Marietta area.  Structure flooding was widespread along several streets near the river.  A traditional Marietta measuring stick, at Shank's Tavern on Front Street, showed a watermark about 3 feet up the structure. That mark was a couple feet short of archived watermarks from a 1936 flood and the Hurricane Agnes flooding of 1972.||On the Conestoga River, Lancaster city officials evacuated residents from low-lying areas of Almanac Avenue and South Broad Street, near the river.  Crews also evacuated 25 people from Conestoga Boulevard in Conestoga Township, going door to door to ask them to leave their homes. Hundreds of roads were closed across the county, a county dispatch supervisor said. Parts of major routes were closed, including routes 222, 30, 23, 72, 441, 230, 322, 741 and 772.||PPL ordered the evacuation of its Holtwood Hydroelectric Plant on Thursday afternoon. The generating plant was shut down and about 20 plant employees were evacuated, beginning about 4 p.m. Another 80 workers involved in the ongoing $434 million expansion of the plant also were evacuated. The last time the hydroelectric plant went through an emergency shutdown and was evacuated was probably during Agnes, a PPL spokesman said.||Three deaths were noted in Lancaster County.	A 62-year-old woman in a vehicle became stranded on Route 322 near Pumping Station Road in Elizabeth Township Thursday morning. Her car was swept away in the water and submerged. An 8-year-old boy playing in a flooded backyard in East Cocalico Township was swept off his feet by the water. His head became caught in a submerged storm drain, where he was found by emergency personnel. He was taken to Ephrata Community Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A man was swept away as he tried to walk through water just off White Oak Road, near the border of Rapho and Penn townships.||A preliminary total of 32 structures were destroyed, 395 suffered major damage, and 1339 minor damage with a total of 1782 structures impacted. Damage was estimated at $818,110 for public facilities.  A total of 189 water rescues were performed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 800.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Another system passed to the south on the 23rd and 24th, continuing the precipitation across the area. A new all-time daily precipitation record for Billings was set on May 24th. These two systems brought a total of 4 to 7 inches of precipitation to the area through the 25th. From May 29th through May 31st, another Pacific storm system moved northeast through the Billings Forecast Area, producing a half inch to 2 inches of precipitation across the area. A few areas received close to 3 inches of precipitation. The culmination of precipitation events resulted in historic flooding across the Billings Forecast Area. The monthly precipitation for May resulted in the wettest May ever recorded in Billings.||Widespread, severe flooding occurred across the entire Billings Forecast Area. Many roads and bridges were damaged or washed out across the area, including closure of I-90 between Livingston and Springdale eastbound lanes. The Montana Department of Transportation alone estimated over $36 million in damage to state and federal highways across the state of Montana. Hundreds of homes and trailers and multiple businesses experienced flood damage. There was damage to flood control dams. On May 19th, Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer declared an emergency for the state. In addition, the Governor requested that the President declare a major disaster for the State of Montana on June 1st, as a result of substantial widespread flooding. Governor Schweitzer deployed the Montana National Guard in Roundup and Crow Agency to help with flood response efforts May 28th and 29th. Flood emergencies were declared by the Governor for all but three counties in the Billings Forecast area. Emergency declarations included the Crow Reservation in Big Horn County. There were two fatalities, an elderly woman in Boyd in Carbon County fell into a flooded ditch and was swept away, and a man from Huntley in Yellowstone County was killed on an excavator when flooding from Pryor Creek overtook him. Multiple Emergency Operation Centers and Incident Commands were set up across the area, including in Billings in Yellowstone County, and in Park County to coordinate flood relief and response efforts.||A persistant upslope northeast flow into the region resulted in another round of locally heavy rainfall again on May 29-30th. An additional 1-2 inches of rainfall were noted, especially for the Beartooth and Big Horn Mountain foothill areas. This resulted in prolonged or even renewed flooding in some locations through the end of the month.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Significant flooding occurred on creeks and streams across Carbon County with numerous county roads flooded, closing roads and resulting in significant damage. Emergency Travel only was advised at one point due to the severity of the flooding. Specifically, Rock Creek flooded, resulting in adjacent lowland flooding and closure of Grape Vine Road near Fromberg. Creeks were running out of their banks from the Beartooth Foothills between McLeod and Red Lodge, as well as tributaries of the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River from Belfry to Bridger. Five Mile Creek flooded and washed out the bridge on East Pryor Road between Edgar and Pryor. Blue Water Creek east of Bridger flooded and washed out a county road as well. The heavy rainfall also resulted in water running over the spillway at Cooney Dam. This resulted in several homes flooded along Red Lodge Creek. ||On May 25th, significant flooding was reported in the town of Joliet as debris backed up Rock Creek resulting in evacuations. At the peak of this flooding, Highway 212 was closed from Rockvale to Red Lodge as 18 inches of water was reported on Highway 212 through the town of Joliet. Fifty homes flooded in the area and seven people, mainly elderly, had to leave with the assistance of the fire and sheriffs offices. The Joliet Motel reported a foot of water in each of their rooms. ||In addition, an 84-year-old woman drowned after she fell into a flooded ditch near her house. She was going to get her newspaper when she slipped and fell. The woman was swept a short distance downstream from her house near Boyd, where authorities found her body.||Damage estimates based on FEMA reviews and Individual Assistance approvals.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Part of the asphalt pavement on U.S. Highway 70 was scoured away by the water between DeValls Bluff and Biscoe. The force of the water left holes two feet deep on Arkansas Highway 38 in the northern part of the county. Dozens of houses flooded in the Des Arc area and evacuations were necessary in DeValls Bluff. Altogether, more than 270 homes in the county suffered flood damage. On the 4th, a 53 year-old man was found drowned near his home in the North Side community near Des Arc. On the 4th, westbound lanes of Interstate 40 near Biscoe were closed when the White River overflowed onto the freeway. Motorists traveling from Memphis to Little Rock had to exit the interstate at Brinkley, take U.S. Highway 49 north to Fair Oaks, then U.S. Highway 64 to Bald Knob, then U.S. Highway 67/167 to Little Rock. This detour was about 120 miles long. On the 5th, the flood waters overtook the eastbound lanes of the interstate, making it the first time that the interstate had ever been closed by flooding on the White River. Motorists exited the interstate at Hazen and took U.S. Highway 63 to Stuttgart, then U.S. Highway 165 to DeWitt, then Arkansas Highway 1 back to the interstate at Forrest City. The eastbound detour lasted only one day before the White River flooded Arkansas Highway 1 at the Arkansas/Monroe County line and a new detour had to be established. The new detour took cars from Interstate 40 south on U.S. Highway 63 to Stuttgart, east on U.S. Highway 79 to U.S. Highway 49, and then north on 49 back to the interstate. Because the bridge over the White River is old and narrow with very narrow shoulders, trucks were unable to use this route and had to take a much longer detour. Trucks went south to Dumas via U.S. Highways 63, 79, and 65 or via U.S. Highways 63 and 165. From Dumas, the trucks followed U.S. Highway 65 south all the way to Lake Village, crossed the Mississippi River on U.S. Highway 82 through Greenville, Mississippi, and then turned north on U.S. Highway 61 to Memphis. Altogether, the truck detour added about 300 miles onto the trip from Little Rock to Memphis. Water on I-40 eventually rose to the top of the concrete wall in the median. The eastbound lanes of Interstate 40 reopened on the 9th, followed by the westbound lanes on the 11th.

From May 29th through May 31st, another Pacific storm system moved northeast through the Billings Forecast Area, producing a half inch to 2 inches of precipitation across the area. A few areas received close to 3 inches of precipitation. The culmination of precipitation events resulted in historic flooding across the Billings Forecast Area. The monthly precipitation for May resulted in the wettest May ever recorded in Billings.||Widespread, severe flooding occurred across the entire Billings Forecast Area. Many roads and bridges were damaged or washed out across the area, including closure of I-90 between Livingston and Springdale eastbound lanes.

In addition, the Governor requested that the President declare a major disaster for the State of Montana on June 1st, as a result of substantial widespread flooding. Governor Schweitzer deployed the Montana National Guard in Roundup and Crow Agency to help with flood response efforts May 28th and 29th. Flood emergencies were declared by the Governor for all but three counties in the Billings Forecast area. Emergency declarations included the Crow Reservation in Big Horn County. There were two fatalities, an elderly woman in Boyd in Carbon County fell into a flooded ditch and was swept away, and a man from Huntley in Yellowstone County was killed on an excavator when flooding from Pryor Creek overtook him. Multiple Emergency Operation Centers and Incident Commands were set up across the area, including in Billings in Yellowstone County, and in Park County to coordinate flood relief and response efforts.||A persistant upslope northeast flow into the region resulted in another round of locally heavy rainfall again on May 29-30th.

Several homes and structures were surrounded by water on Aviemore Court where some voluntary evacuations occurred. In addition, the Briarwood Golf Course was inundated with water.||Pryor Creek was out of its banks resulting in water spilling over a dike in a low lying area of Huntley.

Each storm followed nearly the same track along the Alaska Peninsula then along the Bering Sea coast, setting up a strong moist fetch into the Southcentral Alaska.  This resulted in widespread flood damage over a large area.  Storm total precipitation ranged from 21 to 27 inches along the eastern Kenai Peninsula, while further inland between 6-12 inches of rain fell along the Talkeetna Mountains north to the headwaters of the Nenana River.  A large number of roads and bridges were affected; damage to the Alaska Railroad was severe enough to shut down the rail service for several days.  Almost 60 homes were either severely damaged or destroyed and over 700 other homes were either affected or sustained minor damage; most of the damage occurred along the Little Susitna River and Willow Creek.  State estimates of damage to individual property approached $3.5 million, public infrastructure exceeded $19 million statewide, and the military base in Anchorage sustained an addition $3.5 million in flood damages.  There was one fatality associated with the flooding.  On September 24, a 51 year old man died while attempting to cross a swollen creek on his ATV.||In addition to flooding, the storms brought strong east and southeast wind to an area from southeast Prince William Sound, to Cordova, through Portage Pass, along Turnagain Arm and along the Anchorage.  The first strong storm resulted in wind through the Chugach Mountains with an unofficial peak wind of 120 mph measured by a spotters home weather system in Bear Valley.  In the other wind-prone locations, peak wind was generally around 70 to 75 mph, with 90 mph in reported in Portage Valley.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Susitna River at Sunshine crested at 27.66ft on 9/21/12 at 23:00 AKDT.

Due to the very humid and unstable nature of the atmosphere, the storms produced locally heavy rainfall with rain rates well in excess of one inch per hour. A Flash Flood Warning was issued at about 430 pm, which led to road closures west of El Centro, in the area near Seeley and Dixieland. Thunderstorms persisted into the evening, and additional rainfall led to areas of flooding along Interstate 8, Evan Hewes Highway and Highway 98. According to the California Highway Patrol, at approximately 9 pm flooding caused the closure of Interstate 8 in both directions between Drew Road and Dunaway Road. At 830 pm, local law enforcement reported the evacuation of 5 homes on Evan Hewes Highway due to a bank collapse along the Westside main canal. Heavy rain from earlier storms led to the collapse of the canal bank, and canal water then spread into the homes just west of Seeley. Overflow from the Westside canal eroded Evan Hewes Highway west of Westside road, and 100 feet of the highway were washed away. As a result, Evan Hewes Highway was closed from Dunaway to Westside road. In addition, Dunaway road was damaged beyond repair due to the flooding. Several minor injury traffic accidents were reported during the heavy rain and flooding, as rains limited visibility and made roads very slick. Finally, the breach of the canal resulted in no access to the Centinela State Prison. At 730 pm the Flash Flood Warning was replaced by an areal Flood Warning which continued through 430 am on July 31st.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 400.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These early rains, combined with thunderstorms during the afternoon and early evening, brought areal and river flooding to north central Kentucky. ||By early afternoon, low pressure deepened as it moved northeast across central Illinois and northern Indiana. Rains ceased by mid-day as central Kentucky fell within the warm sector of the developing cyclone. Record high temperatures in the lower 70s arrived by early evening.  A severe squall line developed by mid-afternoon from southern Illinois southwards along the Mississippi River. This line of storms, fueled by ample moisture and an exceptionally strong low level jet in excess of 50 kts, became severe as it moved across southern Indiana and central Kentucky during the evening hours. Three circulations within this line produced tornadoes across central Kentucky and the Bluegrass Region. For the Louisville weather office, these 3 December tornadoes were the first observed since 1971.

A stationary front remained in place from central Nebraska into northern Missouri.  The front aloft remained over Iowa, setting the stage for repeated thunderstorm development.  The parameters changed little from the previous event.  A weakly sheared atmosphere was in place with 25 to 30 kts of shear available.  CAPE values were slightly higher, in the 1000 to 2000 J/kg range.  Downdraft CAPE ranged from under 400 J/kg over the east part of the CWA to 800 J/kg over the west.  A substantial inversion was in place over most of the Des Moines CWA.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was relatively low, only 200 to 400 J/kg.  Precipitable water values were in the 1.3 to 1.6 inch range, or over 2 standard deviations above normal.  Thunderstorms from the previous night weakened, only to be replaced by a new round of thunderstorms that developed over northwest Iowa by mid day on the 26th.  These storms moved southeast across the state, producing heavy rain across many of the areas that received heavy rainfall the night before.  Highway closings were too numerous to mention with many small creeks overflowing their banks and causing flash flooding.  There were several reports of road washouts and bridges being washed out.  A man driving a SUV was swept away by swift flood waters Monday morning on Westbrook Street in Butler County west of Parkersburg.  Severe weather was limited.  The storms produced half dollar size hail in Taylor County.  Hail also fell in Humboldt and Polk Counties.  A funnel cloud was reported in Taylor County as well.  One brief tornado touchdown was reported southwest Diagonal in Ringgold County.  On the morning of the 27th, as the second MCS decayed, high winds occurred over a small part of north central into central Iowa as a wake low formed.  Winds gusted to 58 MPH in Polk County at Ankeny.  An RWIS site in Marshall County at Marshalltown recorded a 60 MPH wind gust.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County and Hardin Counties.

In addition, a weak stationary front stretched along the Front Range Foothills and Palmer Divide.  As a result, a prolonged period of moderate to heavy rain developed across the Front Range Foothills, Palmer Divide, Urban Corridor.  By the 14th, storm totals ranged from 6 to 18 inches, highest in the foothills of Boulder County.  The headwaters then moved down the South Platte River and caused widespread flooding with record flood stages at several locations as it made its way downstream into Nebraska.  Record high flood stages along the South Platte River were recorded at Balzac, Weldona and Julesburg.  As a result, widespread flooding occur along the South Platte for several days as the headwaters continued downstream, with much of the damage reported from Fort Morgan and Brush to around Sterling.  The floodwaters resulted in widespread evacuations.  Numerous water treatment facilities were contaminated and had to be shut down.  The headwaters remained at or above flood stage east of Sterling to Julesburg, but the flooding was not as widespread and the damage not as extensive. ||Initially, the showers that developed on the afternoon of the 11th were moving fast enough and were small enough to produce generally moderate rainfall amounts.   However, rain along the Front Range began to intensify and become more widespread in the evening. A narrow band of very heavy rain began to organize just north of Denver and move westward toward the foothills.  By 9 pm mdt on the 11th, heavy rain was becoming more widespread, with rainfall rates near 2 inches per hour in the heaviest showers.  From 10 pm mdt to Midnight mdt, very heavy rain locked itself in against the Front Range.  Flash flooding became more widespread, with several road closures from northwest Jefferson County northward through Boulder and Larimer Counties.  The heaviest rain in the foothills of Boulder, Larimer and northern Jefferson Counties finally began to abate, but widespread flash flooding continued due to the extremely heavy rainfall during the evening and early morning hours of the 12th.  Meanwhile, torrential rain redeveloped in southwest Weld, northeast Adams, eastern Denver and northwest Arapahoe Counties in the early morning hours of the 12th;  which impacted northeast Denver and Aurora.  ||Atypical for September in Colorado, 24-hour rainfall totals ending 7 am mdt on September 12th included 6.5 to 8.6 inches in Boulder; with 3 to 6.5 inches across the Larimer and Boulder County foothills, as well an area stretching from northeastern Metro Denver area into southwest Weld County.  By 9 am mdt, heavy rain and considerable flash flooding continued through the morning in the Aurora area.   Numerous streams remained at or above bankfull levels across Boulder, Larimer, and southwest Weld counties.  By the evening of the 12th, flooding continued in many areas and increased in severity. Heavy rain, while not as widespread as the previous day, had a greater impact on stream levels as streams were already elevated and the ground was completely saturated. Two peaks of flows occurred on Boulder Creek near downtown. The peak flow on the evening of September 12th surpassed the 1969 Boulder flood, but initial indications are that it fell short of the 1938 and 1894 floods.  Boulder Stream Gauge ���peak flows occurred near 0100 mdt on the 12th, and 2100 mdt on the 12th.   Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Big Thompson River,  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  The headwaters moved down the South Platte with floodwaters impacted Weld, Morgan, Washington and Logan Counties.  Extensive flooding occurred in and around Greeley, Fort Morgan and Sterling.  Large sections of the counties' roads and highways were washed away, with property and crops completely inundated.   ||After little rainfall on Friday, September 13th, the flash flood threat returned for  Saturday. This time, storms with heavy rainfall were concentrated in Douglas County, but also extended northeast into the Aurora area once again. Up to 3 inches of rain fell in one hour.  Plum Creek and other small creeks and streams flooded, along with significant street flooding.  The last day of this prolonged period of very heavy rainfall was on Sunday, September 15th. Another weak front had pushed through the area Saturday night, leaving the atmosphere unseasonably moist and unstable.  Heavy rain developed by mid morning and then became more widespread and peaked in intensity by the noon hour. This time, flash flooding was most significant in the northern portions of the Denver metro area from Northglenn to around Broomfield. Rain finally tapered off during the late afternoon and evening.||The devastating flood damage encompassed 4,500 square miles of the Colorado Front Range, left seven dead, forced thousands to evacuate, and destroyed thousands of homes and farms. Record amounts of rainfall generated flash floods that tore up roads and lines of communication, leaving many stranded.  Nearly 19,000 homes were damaged, and over 1,500 destroyed.  The Colorado Department of Transportation estimated that at least 30 state highway bridges were destroyed and an additional 20 seriously damaged. A preliminary assessment of the state's infrastructure showed damage of $40 million to roads and $112 million to bridges.  Repair costs for state and and county roads were likely to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Miles of freight and passenger rail lines were washed out or submerged, including a section servicing Amtrak's iconic California Zephyr.  The town of Lyons in Boulder County was isolated by the flooding of St. Vrain Creek, and several earth dams along the Front Range burst or were over-topped.   Floodwaters also swept through Estes Park, the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park and a major tourist attraction, and damaged hundreds of buildings and destroyed large sections of the two main roads that led into town; U.S. 34 from Loveland and U.S. 36 from Lyons/Boulder.  U.S. 34 suffered the most damage, with 85 percent of its roadway and bridges destroyed.   In Weld County, approximately 1,900 gas wells were damaged and had to be closed off as the floodwaters inundated entire communities. ||Sewage treatment plants and other utilities were knocked out in a number of towns,  and standing water left by floods on prairie farmlands posed the threat of significant damage to crops already planted in the region.  Northeast Colorado Health Department has advised with the local CSU Extension office in Logan County regarding local crops and gardens that had been exposed to flood waters.  As the flood waters in our area should be considered contaminated, local crops and gardens may not be considered suitable for human consumption or animal feed.  In the flooded areas, an estimated 23,000 acres of cropland was impacted and stretched from Boulder to Logan Counties and included:  alfalfa, corn, hay, silage and sugar beets.  The estimated loss of production ranged from $3.4 million to $5.5 million. ||Governor Hickenlooper declared a disaster emergency on September 13th, in 11 counties across northeast Colorado including:  Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Boulder, Denver, Jefferson, Larimer, Logan, Morgan, Washington and Weld.  By September 15th, federal emergency declarations covered those counties as well as Clear Creek County.  Projected losses from the flooding statewide was nearly $3 billion in property damage.  Half of the damage estimate was from housing and half from the commercial and government sectors, according to Eqecat, a catastrophe modeling firm; this was the first comprehensive estimate of the disaster's economic toll.  The projected losses for residential property alone were about $900 million.  Another $1 billion was attributed to commercial and goverment property, including roads and bridges.  In addition, more than 11 thousand people were evacuated, reportedly the largest since Hurricane Katrina.  President Obama declared a state of emergency for Boulder and Larimer Counties, with an additional 10 counties added September 16th including: Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Clear Creek, Denver, Jefferson, Morgan, Logan, Washington and Weld Counties.

The warm air and strong winds aloft supported the growth of strong damaging storms and heavy rain. Most of the region measured between two to four inches of precipitation. The recently melted snow pack combined with runoff from the moderate to heavy rain that weekend resulted in widespread flooding with all rivers experiencing minor to major flooding.  A warm front lifted north across the area during the evening hours.  Strong to severe thunderstorms developed during the late evening hours of the 21st.

The time of the flooding was estimated based on the stage at a nearby river.||The Greene County Daily World reported that a rural Bloomfield man drowned after he apparently slipped and fell into a flood-swollen creek in Taylor Township on the morning of April the 8th. The victim, 62, lived on the property where Bogard Creek flows on U.S. 231, south of Bloomfield. The Greene County Coroner said no foul play is indicated and it looks like the victim may have been walking along the creek bank and simply fell into the water. The exact time of the incident has not been determined, but his body was found at about 11:30 AM by two close friends who had come to check on the victim. The victim's body was in two to three feet deep water and had been retrieved from the water by the friends when authorities arrived at the site, which is located in Taylor Township between County Road 400 and County Road 600.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.10K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Rising river levels and ice jams led to flooding across portions of northern and eastern Maine. High temperatures on the 14th generally ranged from around 60 to the mid 60s north...to the mid 60s Downeast. These temperatures produced rapid snow melt which led to rising river and stream levels. The rising rivers caused ice to move which led to ice jams. Heavy rains then occurred across the region from the 15th into the 16th in advance of a cold front...with totals of 1.00 to 2.00 inches. Runoff from this rain...in addition to the melting snow...further contributed to rising river levels and ice jams.|River and stream flooding began to develop during the afternoon and evening of the 15th related to the rapid runoff due to snow melt and heavy rains along with ice jams. Runoff from fields and hills overwhelmed culverts and poor drainage areas which contributed to flooding and road closures along with the only fatality of the event. |Significant flooding across Piscataquis and Washington counties lasted into the afternoon of the 17th.

Heavy rain then occurred during the 15th in advance of a slow moving cold front along with continued mild temperatures which contributed to further runoff. Rainfall totals during the 15th generally ranged from 1.00 to 2.00 inches. |Flooding began to develop during the afternoon of the 15th due to rising river and stream levels along with ice jams. Additional flooding was due to runoff from fields and hills which overwhelmed culverts and produced standing water in poor drainage areas. Road closures due to both types of flooding began to develop during the afternoon of the 15th. The number of road closures then steadily increased across the entire county through the remainder of the 15th into the 16th...with numerous road closures persisting into the 18th. |Flooding occurred along portions of both the Aroostook River and Saint John River. Numerous roads were closed around Fort Fairfield...on the Aroostook River...starting on the afternoon of the 15th due to elevated river levels and several ice jams. The final ice jams released during the afternoon of the 16th allowing water levels to recede.  Several forecast points along the Aroostook River reached flood stage. An ice jam caused the river at Washburn to briefly spike above flood stage for around 2 hours during the overnight hours of the 15th into the 16th...cresting around 2.5 feet above flood stage. At Masardis...the river rose above flood stage during the early morning hours of the 16th...crested around a foot above flood stage that afternoon...then fell below flood stage later that evening. Elevated river levels and ice jams contributed to flooding along portions of the Saint John River. An ice jam affected the Saint Francis area during the morning of the 16th resulting in minor flooding. A more significant ice jam...estimated to be 3 to 4 miles long...then affected the Saint Francis area during the 17th into the early morning of the 18th before releasing. This ice jam closed portions of Route 161 between Saint Francis and Allagash due to water and large chunks of ice covering the road. This ice jam also caused the voluntary evacuation of 5 homes along the river for precautionary reasons. When this ice jam released the ice contributed to elevated river levels further downstream...from Hamlin to Van Buren...where portions of Route 1A were briefly closed. Many small streams also overflowed across the county contributing to flooding. Other towns affected by flooding and road closures included Bridgewater...Caribou...Castle Hill...Easton...Hodgdon...Houlton...Mapleton...Presque Isle...Westfield and Wytopitlock.  |Non river flooding also occurred across the region due to the runoff of heavy rain and snow melt from fields and hills. This runoff overwhelmed culverts which led to flooding and road closures...with flooding also occurring in poor drainage areas. The one fatality during this event was due to runoff from fields which had flooded a dirt road in the Caswell area. After moving his vehicle...the individual attempted to walk back across the flooded road and stepped into the fast moving water of a culvert which swept him away resulting in his drowning. This fatality occurred during the evening of the 15th. The monetary damage represents a total from 4 towns.

They were mostly farm roads flooded near the river, outside the Evansville city limits. Most of the flooded roads were south of Interstate 164 in the southeast part of the county and in lowland areas in the southwest part of the county. One motorist drowned after disregarding barricades and driving down a flooded road. A passenger in the vehicle was able to roll down a window and escape from the pickup truck. A police officer arrived, threw a rope to the passenger, and pulled her to safety. The driver of the truck was located underwater by the dive team of the Evansville Fire Department. CPR was administered to the driver, who was rushed to a local hospital. The passenger was treated and released from the hospital. The driver died at the hospital. The estimated water level at the scene of the drowning was estimated to be at least 6 or 7 feet. Floodwaters backed up into Pigeon Creek, forcing that creek well out of its banks. The crest of 45.21 feet was about a foot-and-a-half below the crest of the April, 2011 flood.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The system began to spread rain into the region from the southwest during the early morning hours of Saturday, December 26th, with the rain continuing into Saturday night.  By the morning of Sunday, December 27th, widespread 2 to 5-inch totals were reported southeast of a Jacksonville to Rantoul line.  This amount of rain falling on saturated soils from recent wet conditions produced widespread flash flooding and fast rises on creeks and streams.  After a lull in the rainfall for much of Sunday, another round of rain moved in from the south from Sunday night through the afternoon of Monday, December 28th.  Heavy rains of 1 to 3 inches were common across the entire area from this portion of the event, further aggravating existing flooding conditions.  Once the flash flooding subsided, ongoing areal flooding persisted through December 31st...with river flooding continuing well into January 2016.  Many rivers climbed to major flood stage as a result of the excessive rainfall.  The flooding situation was made even worse by levee breaches, including one along the Embarras River near the Jasper-Crawford County line.  Four people died as a result of this major flooding event across central Illinois.  All four died when their vehicles were swept away by high water in Christian County early in the morning of December 29th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An extended period of heavy rain during the evening of December 26th in Christian County combined with an already saturated ground to produce flash flooding. Rainfall amounts ranged from 2.50 to 4.50 inches in less than six hours, with the heaviest rain in the southern half of the county. Most rural roads and state highways were flooded and impassable. City streets in Taylorville and Pana were also flooded. The flooding continued through all of December 27th. Additional rainfall of 2.50 to 4.75 from December 28th into the 29th aggravated the flooding situation significantly. Every road in the county was flooded which resulted in a shortage of barricades to close the roads. The village of Kincaid was hardest hit as the South Fork of the Sangamon River overtopped levees and flooded the southeast part of town for the first time in its history. People had to be rescued by boat as all roads in and out of town were flooded. Three houses were destroyed by the flooding in Kincaid, with 41 others damaged. Four fatalities occurred in two separate incidents early in the morning of December 29th. Two 18 year old males died as their pickup truck was swept away in flood waters near the South Fork of the Sangamon River and Illinois Route 104 about one mile southeast of Kincaid. Two other people died as their van was swept into the Buckhart Creek about 5 miles ENE of Edinburg. The flooding finally subsided by the afternoon of December 31st, more than four days after it started.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.80M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Numerous roads across several counties we closed as very heavy, persistent rainfall prompted many rivers, streams, and low lying areas to flood.  One fatality was reported during this end of the year flood event.  ||A stalled frontal boundary draped SW to NE laid across the area from the 21st through the 23rd, with several rounds of showers and storms that occurred during this time. It was this rainfall event that likely pushed the HSA ���over the edge��� for the Christmas Day/Dec. 26th flooding that would come just a few days later. SPORT LIS data showed that soil moisture across much of the Central and South/Eastern portions of the HSA was in excess of 60-70%, and when this occurs with ���normal��� rainfall events, a good 2��� rainfall event will cause many tributaries that feed into the Tennessee River to flood. During this 3-day period, KMSL observed 1.03���, and KHSV measured 1.46��� on top of already saturated soils across much of the Tennessee Valley, translating much of this rainfall immediately to runoff. Another stalled front, oriented SW to NE, was draped across the area by the time Christmas Day arrived. A few disturbances moved northeastward along the front, bringing several rounds of showers and a few storms to the HSA yet again. In fact, rainfall started in many locations late Christmas Eve night, and continued into Christmas Day. The rainfall continued all day and into the day after Christmas, with many locations receiving the heavier rainfall on the 26th. Most locations (except NW AL) received at least 3���, with several locations measuring between 6 and 10 inches FOR THE DAY.||Significant river flooding occurred as well.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> From WHNT News Article: Madison County Coroner has identified a man who drowned Sunday afternoon in the New Hope area. Coroner Bobby Berryhill said Gary Sloman, 53, of New Hope, died around 2 p.m. Berryhill said Sloman had left his truck near the flooding to go check on a friend and got caught in the rushing water. Investigator Jeremy Hughes with the Madison County Sheriff���s Office said Sunday they received a call about a body found in flood waters.

The heaviest rainfall occurred in a 50 to 75 mile wide swath from southwest Missouri through the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area and into central Illinois.  Three day rainfall totals within this swath ranged from 6 to 12 inches, with lighter amounts extending both northwest and southeast to the state border.  Some of the precipitation fell as a wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow across northwest portions of the state.  All of this rain caused historic river flooding for the many rivers throughout the region. This resulted in floods of record on the Bourbeuse River at Union, the Meramec River at Pacific, Eureka, Valley Park, and Arnold, and major flooding on the Missouri River (at Gasconade and Hermann), the Mississippi River at Winfield Lock and Dam and points downstream, the Cuivre River at Old Monroe, Dardenne Creek, the Gasconade River, the Moreau River, the Illinois River, and the Kaskaskia River at Vandalia.  The only location not reporting flooding after this event was the Salt River near New London, where the Clarence Cannon Dam regulates the flow.  All other forecast points reported at least minor flooding. Seven flooding deaths were reported in our area due to the heavy rains. Approximately 1500 structures were either damaged or destroyed by the flood waters in the forecast area. At this time dollar amount damages are expected to top $1 billion dollars.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Between 5 and 8 inches of rain fell across Crawford County during a 2 day period. All of this rain caused the creeks and rivers to rise. The Meramec River rose above flood stage at Steelville on December 27th. On December 30th, an 81 year old man drove into the flood waters of the Meramec on Highway N at Campbell Bridge, about 5 miles southeast of Bourbon. He apparently got out of his vehicle and drown. The flooding caused major damage to one home and completely destroyed another one.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The Red River in Shreveport fell below the 33 foot major flood stage on June 15th and fell below the 30 foot flood stage on June 17th. A secondary rise on the Red River developed because of excessive heavy rainfall once again in the middle Red River Basin from the remnants of Tropical Storm Bill. As a result, the Red River at Shreveport crested again at 31.06 feet on June 30th. Downstream of Shreveport at Coushatta, Louisiana the Red River rose above the 31 foot flood stage on May 18th and rose above the 37 foot major flood stage on June 6th. The Red River in Coushatta crested at 38.83 feet on June 11th which was the highest recorded crest in Coushtatta, Louisiana since the flood of 1945. This was the 3rd highest crest at Coushatta in recorded history at the gauging location with the flood of record being 39.9 feet in 1945. The Red River in Coushatta fell below the 37 foot major flood stage on June 16th and fell below the 31 foot flood stage on June 23rd. A secondary rise on the Red River developed because of excessive heavy rainfall once again in the middle Red River Basin from the remnants of Tropical Storm Bill. As a result, the Red River at Coushatta crested again just above the 31 foot flood stage the first week of July, 2015. Below Coushatta at Grand Ecore, Louisiana, the Red River rose above the 33 foot flood stage on May 18th and rose above the 39 foot major flood stage on June 5th. The Red River in Grand Ecore crested at 42.03 feet on June 13th which was the highest recorded crest in Grand Ecore, Louisiana since the flood of 1945. This was the 2nd highest crest at Grand Ecore in recorded history at the gauging location with the flood of record being 44.7 feet in 1945. The Red River in Grand Ecore fell below the 39 foot major flood stage on June 19th and remained above the 33 foot flood stage through the first week of July because of a secondary rise on the Red River as the remnants of Tropical Storm Bill dumped additional heavy rainfall across the Middle Red River Basin in Northern Texas and Southern Oklahoma. Bank erosion was extreme along both west and east banks of the Red River in Grant Parish with thousands of acres of farmland and pastureland inundated. Cattle had to be relocated and many were lost. Many roads were closed adjacent to the Red River in Grant Parish.  The number of structures and homes affected by the rising river and a monetary amount of damage was not available for this writing. The Grant Parish Police Jury closed Lake Iatt and Nantachie Lake because of the flooding.  An annual event known as the Louisiana Mudfest was interrupted when the Red River breached a private levee on the grounds and flooded the park near Colfax, Louisiana.  A deputy working security for the event noticed a crack in the levee on the morning of June 14th.  Within minutes, the levee broke sending the swollen Red River into the park.  Deputies from the Sheriff's Office, agents with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, Louisiana State Police, The Louisiana Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness and The Louisiana National Guard all responded to evacuate 113 people.  This was done with the help of boats and helicopters.  There was one injury when an individual broke his arm.  A number of vehicles were flooded during the event.  About 255,000 sand bags were made available by local law enforcement and the Louisiana Governor's Office of Homeland Security with 655,000 more sandbags on standby. The Grant Parish homeland security sandbagged numerous homes that were in risk of flooding. The Governor of Louisiana authorized the activation of up to 200 Louisiana National Guardsman on State Active Duty to support flood response efforts in Northwest Louisiana and assist local, parish and state emergency officials. Caddo, Bossier, Red River,Natchitoches and Grant Parishes signed emergency declarations due to the excessive flooding and disaster teams from The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and The Governor's Office of Homeland & Emergency Preparedness (GOHSEP) surveying efforts continued as of this writing. A Federal Disaster Declaration was issued for Caddo, Bossier, Red River, Natchitoches and Grant Parishes in Northwest Louisiana for the Red River flooding event of 2015.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As a result, periods of heavy rain, up to an inch per hour in some cases, fell over the same locations. Over the several day stretch, the front fluctuated at times shifting the heaviest band of rain. The storm total rainfall over the 5 day period ranged from four to ten inches over Northwest Mississippi. The heavy rain caused widespread flash flooding and many roads were closed as a result.

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ���It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn���t go back.���||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged. In the worst cases, sections of road bed were washed away.  Public bridges and small private bridges were damaged or destroyed. Large debris piles collected against bridges. Countless vehicles were flooded.  Electricity and water were lost for days in the hardest hit flood areas.         ||The American Red Cross had over 800 workers helping at its peak.  They distributed over 7,500 cleanup kits and over 100,000 meals and snacks.  Many church based organizations and ordinary individual citizens volunteered their time and services to help in the flood recovery.  Nationally known celebrities and sport figures, with ties to West Virginia, also helped to raise awareness and increase donations for flood recovery.||The state transportation secretary estimated 8 million dollars in damage to roads in Clay County, 8 million dollars in Nicholas, over 13 million in Kanawha County.||Several schools were severely damaged by flood waters. This included in Clay County, White Elementary and the county bus garage. In Kanawha County, Herbert Hoover High School, Clendenin Elementary, Elk Valley Christian School, plus Bridge Elementary Schools were severely damaged.  Water from the Elk River crested about 7 feet deep in the first flood at Herbert Hoover High School. In Nicholas County. Richwood High and Middle School was severely damaged.  Moderate flood damage occurred to Clay High School and Elkview Middle School.  Minor flood damage occurred at Middle Birch Elementary School in Braxton County.  Minor flood damage also was seen in Ansted Elementary in Fayette County and Glade Elementary in Webster County.||A state of emergency was declared by Governor Tomblin.  At its peak deployment, around 650 members of the West Virginia Army National Guard and West Virginia Air National Guard were activated.  Major tasks assigned to the guard troops included delivering supplies to residents with no road access, and removal of flood debris.  Private contractors were also used for debris removal. In just Kanawha County, 15,000 tons of flood debris were collected.       ||A federal disaster was quickly declared by President Obama.  At least 8 counties were eligible from the events of June 23rd and 24th within the forecast area of the National Weather Service in Charleston. They included Jackson, Roane, Kanawha, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties.  See FEMA disaster number 4273-DR for more information.  Over 4900 individuals applied for federal assistance from those 8 counties, totaling over 20 million dollars.  Public assistance for debris removal, emergency protective services, roads, bridges, and schools, was over 50 million dollar in those same 8 counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The flood of record occurred on the lower Elk River around Clendenin.  ||Two women died.

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ���It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn���t go back.���||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged.

The truck and trailer became stuck in the flood waters, which filled the passenger compartment of the truck. The flooding occurred as several rounds of thunderstorms with heavy rain moved across southwest Wisconsin from the morning of September 21st into the morning of the 22nd. The heavy rain resulted in flash flooding across portions of Adams, Clark, Crawford, La Crosse, Monroe, Richland, Vernon and Trempealeau Counties. A train derailed near Ferryville (Crawford County) when the roadbed was washed away by flooding. Around 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled into the water from one of the locomotives. Two people had to be rescued near De Soto (Vernon County) and another in Sidie Hollow County Park southwest of Viroqua (Vernon County). Washouts and road closures occurred in Trempealeau, La Crosse, Vernon and Crawford Counties. In Vernon County alone, high water and flooding resulted in 90 road closures and 44 homes and business were destroyed. Public and private sector damages in Vernon County totaled almost $10 million. In Crawford County, 2 homes were destroyed with another 67 damaged with public and private sector damages totaling almost $5 million. Flooding on the Black River in Black River Falls (Jackson County) caused the hydroelectric dam to loose a gate when a large tree traveled over the dam. Several boats and docks that broke loose in Lake Arbutus also traveled over the dam. A state of emergency was declared in Clark, Crawford, Jackson and Vernon Counties. The Governor of Wisconsin declared a state of emergency for Adams, Clark, Crawford, Jackson, La Crosse, Monroe, Richland, Trempealeau and Vernon Counties.

Rainfall ranged from 2 to 4 inches on the southern beaches to 8 to 12 inches inland. This rain led to significant flash flooding over  much of eastern North Carolina during the afternoon of October 8th through the morning of October 9th. Many roads were washed out and impassable for days from the serious flash flooding. Devastating river flooding then occurred several days after Matthew as most main-stem rivers exceeded major flood levels. Strong winds of 40 to 60 mph inland and 60 to 80 mph along the coast occurred as Matthew passed offshore mainly during the evening of October 8th through the morning of the 9th. These winds led to numerous downed trees and power lines across the region with widespread power outages that lasted several days in some areas. Storm surge inundation was mainly 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the coast, however inundation of 3 to 5 feet above ground level was observed on the sound side of the Outer Banks. ||There were six confirmed fatalities across the area with five in Lenoir County and one in Pitt County.

In all, approximately 25,000 homes and hundreds of additional businesses suffered various degrees of flooding, though it's difficult to determine how many were due to initial flash flooding and how many were due to subsequent river flooding. Due to the extremely high water levels on the Amite river, water flowed back upstream on many streams and bayous, leading to a significant back water flooding problem. Much of the flooding in the southern part of the parish was due to this back water flooding. The end time of the flood is based on when Bayou Manchac near Little Prairie dropped below flood stage. However, some back water flooding continued on the Bluff Swamp for several more days. Four fatalities are attributed to the flooding.

A cold front stalled across the Lower Ohio and Mid-Mississippi Valleys, where tropical moisture was already in place. Precipitable water values from 2.25 to 2.5 inches were common. A sub-tropical low pressure system that produced torrential rains along the Gulf of Mexico coast then turned north, eventually getting pulled northeast across Missouri along the stalled cold front. This low brought copious amounts of moisture. Showers and isolated thunderstorms brought torrential downpours between the 13th and 17th. Rainfall amounts during this time ranged from 5 to 10 inches north and west of Cape Girardeau, including the Poplar Bluff and Perryville areas. There were isolated reports of 12 to 17 inches in the Ozark foothills, including Doniphan and Greenville.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Moderate flooding occurred along the Black River, resulting in one fatality and some flooded homes. Several homes were evacuated, and there was considerable flooding of streets and highways. In Poplar Bluff, portions of several streets were flooded with several feet of water, mainly those streets with river frontage. A city riverside park was flooded. Southeast of Poplar Bluff in a rural area, individuals were evacuated from a home on County Road 611, and homes on County Road 608 were threatened. Just east of Poplar Bluff, a water rescue of a flooded home was conducted near the intersection of Missouri Highway B and County Road 559. Flooding of farmland was rather extensive south and southeast of Poplar Bluff. Floodwater from the river eventually shut down Highway 53 near the Black River bridge between Qulin and Poplar Bluff. The flooding was exacerbated by a levee breach at County Road 202 near Qulin. A 44-year-old woman was possibly attempting to find an alternate route around the flooding when her car became submerged on County Road 647 near Highway 53. The incident occurred on the night of the 16th. The vehicle and its deceased occupant were located on the afternoon of the 19th. At the Poplar Bluff river gage, the river crested at 20.28 feet on the afternoon of the 16th. Flood stage is 16 feet.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

During the day a strong low level jet pumped very moist air into the region. The jet and a west to east stationary front were the triggers for thunderstorms that developed later in the day. Rounds of thunderstorms brought some damaging winds to parts of northwest Wisconsin late Monday afternoon and evening. These storms were followed by evening storms that began training as the night wore on. The training storms resulted in very heavy rain over the region. Historic flooding followed the extremely high average rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches. There was a wide corridor of about 8 to 10 inches of rain from northern Iron County to northern Burnett County, including Saxon Harbor on Lake Superior, and the towns  of Marengo, Cable, Hayward, Wascott, Minong, and Danbury.  The initial squall line of storms brought down many trees. The effects of the wind and a raging, flooded Oronto Creek caused enormous damage at Saxon Harbor. At Saxon Harbor, where 70 vessels were moored, 6 boats sank and the rest were set afloat. Most vessels were recovered. One man drowned in these floodwaters.

A large complex of thunderstorms moved southeast across southeast Missouri during the evening hours of the 29th. The storms occurred near a surface cold front which sagged southward across southern Missouri during the evening. This deluge of heavy rain brought flash flooding to the Ozark foothills.

This complex occurred along the same front, which moved back north as a warm front across southeast Missouri. These storms caused considerable flash flooding. They also accelerated rises in area rivers, which were already above flood stage in some cases. The rainfall total for the three-day period from April 28 to April 30 was 12.25 inches at Ellsinore in Carter County from the public. A public report of 12.01 inches was received from Old Appleton, near the Perry / Cape Girardeau County line. In Perryville (Perry County), a Cocorahs observer measured 9.87 inches. North and west of a line from Dexter to Sikeston, there were numerous reports of rainfall in the 5 to 10 inch range, including 9.60 inches at Williamsville (Wayne County), 9.21 inches at Patterson (Wayne County), 8.90 inches at Van Buren (Carter County), 7.76 inches at Marble Hill, 6.54 inches at Poplar Bluff, and 5.65 inches at the Cape Girardeau riverfront.

At the Poplar Bluff river gage, the river crested at 21.96 feet late on the morning of the 1st. This crest was only a few inches below the record crest of 22.15 feet, set in March of 2008. The main levee from Poplar Bluff to the Qulin area was under extreme stress. One section of levee broke in the vicinity of County Road 608, requiring eight houses to be evacuated. The levee was overtopped in more than a dozen spots. The part of the levee protecting Poplar Bluff, including the downtown area, was overtopped in a couple of places. Police and firefighters went door-to-door on the south side of Poplar Bluff advising residents of a levee breach just outside the city limits. Some homes in the flood plain were flooded, mostly in rural areas south of Poplar Bluff. Areas of south central Butler County were evacuated. A total of about 54 homes were damaged, and two were destroyed. About 10 businesses were damaged. A Red Cross shelter at the Black River Coliseum sheltered about 80 residents. There were two fatalities as a result of the river flooding. The first drowning victim was a 69-year-old woman, whose body was recovered from inside her vehicle on May 2 but who actually drowned on April 30. Her vehicle was swept off a county road outside of Harviell. The second drowning involved a 60-year-old man, whose truck was washed off Route 53 into a ditch near County Road 618.  Most area schools were closed during the crisis. Grain bins were flooded, though some of the crop was removed before the flooding could damage it. Numerous state and county roads were closed, including Highway 53. Parts of Qulin were flooded. Between Qulin and Neelyville, residents of the Coon Island area were evacuated. In the Neelyville area, about a half dozen or so people were evacuated by boat. Damage to public property alone was estimated at nearly two million dollars.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The heaviest rainfall held over the Redwood, and Cottonwood river basin for several hours. Several of the flash flooding parameters, including flash flood guidance, and return period for a 6 hour rainfall event, were extreme. The suggested return period for such an event in six hours was well over 200 years. ||Over 50 township and country roads were affected by the flood waters. Due to the numerous county roads and bridges that were impassable, the national guard was called in to help those who were isolated due to flood waters. ||By the time the rainfall tapered off Tuesday morning, rainfall amounts ranged from a measured high of 10.50 inches near Wabasso, to several measured amounts of 5 to 9 inches from Belview and Delhi, south and southwest to Redwood Falls, Lucan, to around Walnut Grove, and Lamberton. ||In addition to the flash flooding that inundated the area,  the heavy rains that fell on July 3 caused major flooding on rivers in southwest Minnesota. The Cottonwood River at New Ulm had its second highest crest of record, with 19.64 feet on July 6th. The record crest there is 20.86 feet set on April 8, 1965. The Redwood River at Marshall set a record crest of 17.41 feet on July 3, breaking the old record of 17.09 feet from September 25, 2010. There was extensive flooding in Redwood county with basements flooding and water closing roads. Tracy, Lamberton and Springfield were some of the hardest hit towns due to road closures and detours from flooded farmland. ||Another unfortunate cause from the flooding was an apparent drowning. An individual's car was found completely underwater in a ditch in Hector Township. The vehicle was unoccupied when it was pulled from the water. The body from the vehicle was found two days later in a ditch upstream from the location of the car. ||Governor Dayton declared an emergency for several counties hit by this storm, and storms from the previous month including; Blue Earth, Brown, Faribault, Freeborn, Martin, Mille Lacs, Nicollet, Redwood, Renville, Sibley, Stearns, Stevens, Waseca and Watonwan counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flood waters slowly receded from excessive rainfall that occurred Tuesday morning.

The following counties were included in a subsequent Presidential Disaster Declaration: Botetourt, Franklin, Halifax, City of Martinsville, Patrick, and Pittsylvania.

The front was tilted northward with the 700 mb level of the front just north of the Ohio River. Low level northward flow carried moisture and overran the front producing widespread stratiform rain showers. The pattern was in response to the area sitting under the right entrance region of an upper level jet.||The quasi-stationary front produced showers with high rainfall rates and slow movement to the east into the Bluegrass and northeastern Kentucky. The ground east of Interstate 65 and in counties along the Ohio River was already saturated from previous rainfall. The high rainfall rates and slow system movement caused widespread flash flooding and areal flooding through southern Indiana and the Bluegrass Region of Kentucky.||On September 25th ahead of an advancing cold front, a saturated air mass was in place with precipitable water values near two inches.

Florence strengthened rapidly on September 4���5, becoming a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. Florence weakened to a tropical storm by September 7, but the system regained hurricane strength on September 9 and major hurricane status with winds of 140 mph on September 10.

The heaviest rain occurred Saturday and Sunday (Oct 6-7). By Tuesday night (October 9th) more than 11 inches of rain fell in and around the Kansas City Metro. Local drought conditions were still in the Extreme to Exceptional category going into the event, so flash flooding was relatively low impact, relegated mostly to several road closures. The bigger impact from this prolonged rainfall event came from local river and stream flooding. Several streams entered the moderate to major flooding category. The 4 day event spanning Oct 6-9 resulted in the greatest 4 day rain total in recorded Kansas City History. At Kansas City International Airport 9.79 inches were recorded for the Oct 6-9 time period, beating out Sept 12-15, 1977, which had 9.48 over the 4 day span.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> From FOX 4 Kansas City: Miami County Sheriff���s Office confirmed to FOX4 that a missing 78-year-old woman has been found dead.

The rainy weather pattern that dominated January and February became less active in March. The winter of 2018-19 ended up being the fourth wettest winter on record at Paducah, where records go back to 1937. February was the second wettest February on record at Paducah. Record rainfall in the Cumberland and Tennessee Valleys sent a large volume of water into Kentucky and Barkley Lakes. Both lakes crested around 367 feet, 8 feet above their summer pool stage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A prolonged major river flood that peaked in February subsided in March. Information on the February crest height and the total property damage estimate is contained in the February report. The flood damaged about 50 homes in McCracken County. Levee and flood wall gates were installed in the Paducah area. This action along with heavy rainfall in west Kentucky and backwater from the Ohio and Tennessee Rivers caused widespread flooding in the southeast part of McCracken County. Smaller rivers and creeks such as the Clarks River had nowhere to drain and kept rising with each successive round of heavy rain. One fatality occurred due to a vehicle that drove into Clarks River floodwaters. A male, age 59, drove around a barricade and into floodwaters off Highway 787 near the Marshall County line. His girlfriend escaped the vehicle, but he did not. His body was recovered and CPR was administered but to no avail. Countywide, a damage assessment indicated 35 residences sustained minor damage and 15 sustained major damage. Numerous roads were closed around the county, especially in the flood plain west of Paducah and the Clarks River basin in eastern McCracken County. Some of the largest state roads that were closed included Highway 131 south of Reidland, Highway 305 in West Paducah, and Highway 284 between Reidland and Paducah. A Red Cross shelter was opened in Paducah. The City of Paducah declared a state of emergency and installed most of the floodgates in the floodwall. The city's convention center was inaccessible for over a week due to its location outside the floodwall. A makeshift barrier was installed around the convention center to prevent flooding.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A cold front brought additional rainfall through the afternoon and evening, before drier conditions worked into eastern Kentucky during the morning of February 21. ||Rain quickly spread back north that evening into the 22nd with southeastern Kentucky continuing to see prolonged light rain into the afternoon of the 23rd. A cold front brought additional rain to much of eastern Kentucky late on the 23rd. ||A spike in moisture ahead of this front resulted in additional moderate to heavy rain and high rainfall rates across portions of eastern Kentucky late on the 23rd. The convection ahead of the cold front that evening resulted in the majority of the flooding and flash flooding issues across eastern Kentucky. Showers and thunderstorms capable of heavy rainfall trained over parts of Wayne, Pulaski, Rockcastle, and other counties along the I-75 corridor, resulting in deadly flash flooding and river flooding along the Cumberland River. Later in the evening, the bulk of the rainfall shifted north to counties along the Mountain Parkway. Flash flooding and river flooding occurred in Powell, Wolfe, Breathitt, Magoffin, and Johnson Counties. Lighter rainfall continued into the night as flooding issues remained widespread into the 24th.||Rainfall amounts from this event ranged from near 2 inches in portions of the Bluegrass region and northeast Kentucky, to greater than 4 inches across locations in southern and southeast Kentucky. ||This additional water on top of saturated ground continued to promote mud and rock slides across eastern Kentucky, complete with power outages from fallen debris and trees. Pikeville experienced a massive rockslide early on February 22, resulting in several cars and a building being damaged. Other impacts included countless roads being inundated with standing water, pavement and water pipes breaking, water threatening homes, roads and bridges being washed away, and rising lake levels.||Of the 33 counties across eastern Kentucky, at least 27 were forced to declare State of Emergencies due to rainfall during and before this event. This included Knott County due to over $150,000 in county road damages. Beattyville, Clay City, Harlan, Hazard, Jenkins, Monticello, Paintsville, Pikeville, Salyersville, Stanton, West Liberty, and Whitesburg also declared State of Emergencies. Additionally, the Kentucky Governor declared a State of Emergency across the entire Commonwealth.||The persistent rainfall of the winter season and the amount of rainfall from this event led to Lake Cumberland reporting their highest lake level of 756.52 feet on February 26th, breaking the old record of 751.69 feet dating back to May 1984. As a result, Wolf Creek Dam had to release at a record discharge level of 59,880 cubic feet per second. Cave Run Lake also rose to within 6 feet of their record pool elevation. Buckhorn Lake came within 10 feet of their all-time record, partially resulting in Kentucky Highway 257 near Confluence having flood waters cover the highway isolating 40 to 50 families for three weeks following the end of the flooding rains.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A local news media outlet reported that a motorist crashed into Wolf Creek off of Stidham Road south of Cinda. The driver's body was later found trapped inside the car. Additionally, a bystander also died as a result of the flooded creek after he jumped in to try to save the driver. The creek was 3 to 4 times higher than normal, contributing to the death of both men.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

From 4 to 15 inches of snow cover remained across the mid Missouri River valley, and the ground was frozen with existing frost depths of 15 to 23 inches. Warm temperatures allowed all of the snow to rapidly melt and record moisture allowed 1 to 2.5 inches of rain to fall over a 48 hour period.  Due to the frozen ground, and that 1 to 2 feet of thick ice remained in area rivers, widespread, and in many cases, catastrophic flooding developed. Due to expansive levee breaches on many rivers and streams, the flood damage was particularly devastating to many communities. Four individuals lost their lives due to the extreme conditions, and several hundred people required rescue via air or boat. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from their homes or businesses. Nearly 50 levees were breached on the Platte, Elkhorn and Missouri Rivers due to the large volume of water. One such levee breach along the Platte River near Leshara, Nebraska forced the evacuation of National Weather Service Omaha, located in Valley, Nebraska for 8 days. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts presented US$1.3 billion preliminary damage estimates for the entire state, including specific sector losses of: $439 million infrastructure (including roads and bridges), $85 million private homes and businesses, $400 million livestock and $440 million crop. About 2,000 miles of state roads including 15 Nebraska state highway bridges and numerous local bridges, roughly 20 percent of the entire state road system were impacted. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds provided a $1.6 billion preliminary damage estimate due to flooding across the state. U.S. Interstate 29, extending north-south along the Missouri River, was inundated and partially destroyed, as was the Interstate 680 bypass around Council Bluffs-Omaha metropolitan area. Also noteworthy was damage to Offutt Air Force Base located near Bellevue, Nebraska. One-third of the base���s main runway was inundated, along with one-third of Offutt���s buildings, with several hundred employees, and several families displaced. Preliminary damage estimates released by the Department of Defense are on the order of $450 million. Nebraska and Iowa severe flooding impacts culminated in Federal Disaster Declaration 4420.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is for flooding along the Loup River. The river gage at Columbus, operated by the Nebraska DNR, peaked at 19.39 feet at 5 am on March 15th. Major flood stage is 20 feet. Preliminary this peak is the 2nd highest on record. This flooding caused substantial damage to the area, specifically on the river side of the levee around Columbus. This damage was the result of both ice jam and open water flooding. Several businesses and homes were destroyed and many people needed to be rescued. The water got within 1 to 2 feet of the top of the levee and never got into Columbus.  One woman was killed by flood waters in her home.  Rescuers could not get to her home due to extreme weather conditions.  Property damage amounts represent amounts for the entire county.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 440.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

S. and ridging along the Gulf Coast and southeastern U. S., set the stage for numerous rounds of rainfall across the Southern Plains from May 18th through the end of the month. The atmospheric moisture remained unseasonably high during this period, resulting in very efficient rainfall-producing showers and thunderstorms. Antecedent conditions from the rainfall earlier this month and at the end of April meant that soil moisture was already high, and any additional rainfall would quickly become runoff. Antecedent river and lake levels were also above normal ahead of this active storm period. Six to sixteen inches of rain fell between May 18th and May 30th along and northwest of a line from near Okmulgee, OK to near Bentonville, AR, and three to five inches of rain fell southeast of this line. Widespread ten to sixteen inch amounts fell across portions of southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma. During this period, six USACE Tulsa District flood control reservoirs set new pools of record in northeastern Oklahoma: Kaw, Keystone, Skiatook, Birch, Oologah, and Hudson Lakes.||The result was 31 river floods at 22 river forecast points in eastern Oklahoma. There was a total of 54 crests during those 31 floods, two of which were new records (Arkansas River near Ponca City, and Bird Creek at Avant), and 25 of which were crests in the major flood category. Fourteen of the 31 floods lasted seven days or more; eleven lasted ten days or more; two lasted fourteen days or more; and one lasted 21 days or more. The Arkansas River near Muskogee was above flood stage the longest at approximately 22 days and 5 hours, and was also above the major flood category the longest at approximately 13 days and 12 hours.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Arkansas River near Tulsa rose above its flood stage of 18 feet at 12:30 am CDT on May 22nd. The river crested at 23.41 feet at 3:00 pm CDT on the 29th, resulting in major flooding. This was the second highest crest on record. Severe flooding occurred along the Arkansas River in Tulsa County, with some homes in south Tulsa and Bixby flooded. Riverside Drive in Tulsa was closed in places. A man fell into the river in Tulsa on the 26th, and another waded into the river. Both men drowned. Monetary damage from this flood is unknown. The river remained above flood stage through the end of May, and finally fell below flood stage at 6:30 am CDT on June 1st.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Initially the heavy rain led to flash flooding and caused area washes and creeks to flow heavily. Water rose above action stage in Tonto Creek by mid morning, and continued to rise into the afternoon hours. According to local law enforcement, at about 1600MST a large vehicle drove around barriers and attempted to cross flooded Tonto Creek about 3 miles to the southeast of Punkin Center. The vehicle contained at least 2 adults and 7 children. The vehicle was swept away by rapidly flowing flood waters; the 2 adults were rescued along with 4 of the children. However, 3 of the children did not survive. 2 were rescued rather quickly but the third, a 6 year old girl, was not found until at least 2 weeks later after extensive search and rescue efforts.

The warm front continued to gradually mix north northwest into East Texas and Northcentral Louisiana by late morning and early afternoon hours, with a very warm, moist, and unstable air mass noted over Deep East Texas and portions of Northcentral Louisiana south of the front. Coupled with even stronger forcing and low level shear ahead of the approaching upper trough, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed near and south of the front from late morning through the afternoon, producing several reports of damaging winds across portions of Northcentral Louisiana.

This continued through February 7th, highlighted by heavy rainfall from the evening of February 5th through the first half of February 6th. Rain amounts of 4-6 inches fell across much of southeastern Kentucky over this period. This led to major flooding and numerous mudslides across portions of Whitley, Perry, Letcher, Leslie, Knox, Harlan, Clay, and Bell Counties. The Governor subsequently declared a State of Emergency for these 8 counties.||Major flooding occurred along the Cumberland River at Pineville, Barbourville, and Williamsburg. Additionally, the communities of Loyall and Baxter experienced major flooding. Numerous roads became impassable across large portions of Whitley, Knox, Clay, Leslie, Letcher, Harlan, Perry, and Bell counties. In particular, Harlan County was hit extremely hard with the Kentucky Mesonet site on Black Mountain (4031 foot elevation) receiving over 6.5 inches of rain over this stretch. ||Flood gates were closed in Pineville and Harlan, further impacting local travel. A couple of mobile homes were flooded and swept down the Cumberland River in Harlan County, while swift water rescues took place in Bell and Harlan Counties. Elkhorn Dam in Jenkins had water rushing over it for a period of time on February 6. A man went missing in Whitley County and was later found deceased in his car on Kentucky Highway 779 after his attempt to drive into flood waters. A total of seven homes were reported to have been in or under water across Whitley County as the Cumberland River in Williamsburg crested to its third highest stage on record of 34.84 feet. The city of Pineville saw the river rise to its second highest crest in history at 1019.06 feet, leading to several families being stranded without homes.||While impacts were certainly greatest along the Cumberland River, several portions of the Kentucky River also flooded. Several roads were impacted in Hazard and Whitesburg, while Booneville, Heidelberg, and Ravenna also exceeded flood stage. Along the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River, a rarity occurred as Pikeville hit flood stage and forced the city to shut its flood gates.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Emergency Management reported extensive flooding in Williamsburg and elsewhere across Whitley County, especially east of town. Several swift water rescues were performed with one woman being diagnosed with hyperthermia. At least 38 homes were inundated with water, with six of these being completely under water. Many businesses also sustained extensive water damage, especially along the Cumberland River basin. Several local residents rate this as the second worst flood in their memory, right behind that of the April 1977 flood.||On February 10th, a man was found dead inside his vehicle on Kentucky Highway 779. He apparently attempted to drive through flood waters on his way to work on February 6th.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Snow levels rose to near 5000 feet.   The heavy rain and snow melt lead to moderate flooding and several landslides along the East Slopes of the Washington Cascades. There was record flooding on several rivers, including the Umatilla, Walla Walla and Touchet rivers with widespread flooding of numerous other creeks and streams and rivers across Umatilla, Union and Wallowa Counties of Oregon and Walla Walla and Columbia Counties of Washington. Initial Weather Conditions February 1, 2020, snowpack across along the East Slopes of the Washington Cascades ranged from 80 to 100 percent of normal.   Across the northern Blue Mountains of Oregon and northern Blue mountains of Washington the snowpack was near normal. A weather system brought heavy snow to this region on February 4th and the first part of the day on February 5th with snow amounts from around 10 to 20 inches for locations between 2000 to 4000 feet. During the afternoon of the 5th, snow changed to rain at elevations below 5000 feet.  Selected locations snow amounts for February 4-5, include 8 inches at 2.6 miles SSE of Snoqualmie Pass, 7 inches at Cle Elum, 2 inches at Easton, 12.5 inches at Ski Blue Wood and 2 inches at Dayton in Columbia County. For Oregon, snow amounts include, La Grande 7-10 inches, Summerville 10 inches, La Grande, 5 Miles NNE- 17.5 inches, Meacham 13 inches, Elgin 9.8 N 8 inches, Joseph 6 inches and Wallowa 8 inches. The rain continued over through February 6 and 7th. Precipitation amounts in the form of rain at the headwaters of the rivers, ranged from 3 to 5 inches.  Rain amounts for the 48 hours ending on the morning of February 8th, for selected locations include 6.31 inches at 2.6 miles SSE of Snoqualmie Pass, 3.27 inches at Easton, 5.83 inches near Lake Cle Elum and 2.17 inches at 8.7 miles NE Dayton.  Snotel sites reported 2 day precipitation amounts of 6.3 inches at Touchet #2 in the Columbia County. There was 1.98 inches over 72 hours at 1.1 NE Walla Walla.   In Oregon, rain amounts for the 48 hours ending on the morning of February 8th for selected locations include:  from Coop Observer, Emigrant Springs ��� 2.82 inches, Union 1.01 inches ,  Cove- 2.48 inches, La Grande - 2.50 inches,  Lostine ��� 1.39 inches.  From CoCoRahs and other public weather spotters, 9.8 N Elgin ��� 5.45 inches, La Grande- 3.02 inches and Wallowa 2.66 inches.  Snotel sites reported 2 day precipitation amounts of 5.9 inches at High Ridge, 3.0 inches at Moss Springs, 1.6 inches at Milkshake. In addition, the snowpack from the preceding day was melted, contributing to the runoff.  Observations show 5 to 7 inches of snow melted from February 5th to February 6th at Easton and Cle Elum. Home owners in the Lake Cle Elum area noted a loss of 3 to 5 feet of snow An observer located 5 miles north of La Grande reported 17.5 inches of snow fell on February 4-5 and then by the morning of February 6th, the snow depth had decreased to around 8 inches and was depleted during the day on the 6th.   Satellite snowpack images show 1-3 inches of snow water equivalent (or water held in the snowpack) melted out along both the east and west sides of the northern Blue Mountains in Oregon and around the foothills of the Grande Ronde Valley generally between 2000 to 4000 feet. Streams, creeks and rivers rose rapidly through the night of February 5th, with the first instance of flooding reported on early morning on February 6th.  The streams and rivers continued the rapid rises through the day on February 6th, with the Umatilla River reaching record high water levels at the gaging sites near Gibbon and at Pendleton and moderate flooding on the Grande Ronde River at the gaging sites near Perry and Troy. Most rivers and streams crested overnight on February 6th or on the morning of February 7th and then slowly receded back below flood stage on February 8th and 9th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Umatilla County ��� There was record flooding along the entire reach of the Umatilla River.  There was extensive damage to areas along the river, including homes, roads including Interstate 84, railroads  as well as other public facilities such as parks and sports complexes.  Along the upper reaches of the river, roads were washed out with homes damaged or destroyed.  One resident was swept away by flood waters and died.  A number of residents had to be evacuated via helicopter or 4 wheeler with 70 homes on the Umatilla Indian Reservation damaged.  The Riverview Mobile Home Park at Pendleton was inundated.  There was minimal to no damage through Pendleton, due to the levee, but the Bob White Baseball field had extensive damage as water overtopped a low wall.  Adjacent to Pendleton, the levee was damaged and overtopped with water flowing through the Keystone RV Manufacturing plant and the Colby Pipe Company.  Several bridges and roads downstream from Reith to Echo were damaged or washed out with a number of homes damaged.   Downstream from Echo to the confluence of Columbia River, the river rose out of the banks and flooded Interstate 84 between Highway 395 and Highway 208.  Several semi-trucks were stranded in the flood waters with extensive damage to the highway.  Numerous pastures and buildings along the river through Stanfield were flooded with extensive damage to Oxbow Park in Hermiston and to a sports complex in Umatilla.

A warm front moved northward into Middle Tennessee early on March 27 before stalling near the I-40 corridor. Between 300-400 AM CDT, numerous showers and thunderstorms developed along the warm front, many of which became severe and produced large hail up to half dollar size along with frequent lightning and heavy rainfall. Showers and storms continued off and on the rest of the day across Middle Tennessee, particularly near the stalled warm front. In fact, another round of severe thunderstorms including supercells developed during the afternoon and evening hours near and south of the warm front. These storms dropped large hail up to tennis ball size and caused a few reports of wind damage, but the main impact was additional heavy rainfall which began causing flash flooding south of Nashville. Flooding only worsened as showers and storms redeveloped over the same areas through the evening, with numerous Flash Flood Warnings issued and several reports of flooded roads and water rescues.||After midnight, even more heavy rainfall falling along the already waterlogged I-40 corridor prompted a rare Flash Flood Emergency for the southern and eastern Nashville metro area, including southeastern Davidson County, western Wilson County, and northern Williamson County. These areas received between 7 to 9 of rain, causing rapid rises on several Nashville metro creeks and streams, including Sevenmile Creek (which reached its highest level on record), Browns Creek, and Mill Creek, among others. Many of these creeks reached within their 2nd or 3rd highest water levels on record. The rapid water rises flooded hundreds of homes and businesses, with reports of some people trapped in the attics or on the roofs of their houses. Dozens of roadways were flooded and impassable, including both I-24 and I-40, with many cars submerged in the flood waters and people forced to cling onto trees to avoid getting swept away. Although the flood waters receded quickly on Sunday, March 28, many area rivers reached flood stage in the week after the event, including the Cumberland River, Harpeth River, and Duck River.||A total of 7 deaths were reported from the flooding across Middle Tennessee, with 5 in Davidson County, 1 in Cheatham County, and 1 in Maury County. Emergency management reports indicate over 500 homes and businesses were flooded, and a Presidential Disaster Proclamation was declared for many counties in May 2021. This flash flood event was the worst seen in Middle Tennessee since the May 1-2, 2010 flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A man drowned in his vehicle after driving around high water barricades into flood waters on Tennessee Waltz Parkway near Highway 12 in Ashland City.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The disturbance rotated eastward near St. Louis, Missouri just ahead of a cold front. The soil across southern Illinois was saturated from an early morning round of thunderstorms.

Most notably within this line of storms was a cluster of QLCS tornadoes that formed in Grundy County. There may have been other tornadoes associated with circulations that were noted on radar, but emergency management confirmed damage consistent with tornadoes near Trenton and Laredo Missouri. Most of the damage was minor, but some grain bins being blown off their foundation was the highlight of the damage in the area. Rainfall was the other big story with this event as some areas received 6 to 10 inches of rain. Despite the excessive rain, the flash flooding was rather minor, however there were still numerous roads closed, and areas near Excelsior Springs were especially hard hit as the Fishing River rose out of its banks. Another semi-dramatic event occurred along I-29 just north of St. Joseph, where a crane that was being used to do road construction became unbalanced and tipped.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Well after rain had ended, Castille Creek was high enough to cover the road at County Line road.

This second atmospheric river episode of the month was a set of three atmospheric rivers back-to-back-to-back. Water vapor transport into Western Washington averaged 160 - 200% of normal during the period of 11 November - 16 November. Heavy rainfall spread across the region on the night of the 11th through November 12, with the heaviest rain starting across Southwest Washington and slowly shifting to the north through the day. Rainfall totals ranged from 5 to 10 inches in spots leading to areal and river flooding, including major flooding. |Heavy, persistent rainfall associated with the Atmospheric River shifted northward across Western Washington on November 13 before stalling over northwest Washington November 14 through 16. Another 5 to 10 inches of rainfall fell across the northern half of western Washington. The snow level rose to 8000 to 10,000 feet, resulting in some snow melt contributing to runoff.  Widespread minor or greater flooding occurred. Major flooding occurred on the Bogachiel, the three forecast points on the Nooksack, Skagit, and Cowlitz Rivers. Moderate flooding occurred on the Elwha, Skokomish, Skykomish, Snohomish, Snoqualmie, Puyallup, Nisqually, Newaukum Rivers and South Prairie Creek. Preliminary record flows occurred on Nooksack, Bogachiel, Calawah Rivers and Olsen Creek. Hundreds of water rescues and two fatalities took place during this time period. The heavy rainfall also triggered numerous landslides due to loading on the already-saturated soils.|Much of the reported damage amounts were for both episodes in November and some of the amounts for this episode were an estimated proportion for the month.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rain and some snow melt caused flooding that exceeded major severity on the South Fork Nooksack River and mainstem Nooksack River at North Cedarville and Ferndale. There was urban and small stream flooding as well, hitting Bellingham especially hard. The heavy rain also triggered a dozen landslides throughout the area. Significant flooding on the Nooksack River also overflowed at the City of Everson to the degree that flood waters flowed north along an old Nooksack floodway and Johnson Creek where it flooded the cities of Everson and Nooksack, WA, then combined with flooding from the Sumas River and flooded the City of Sumas, WA where over 85% of homes sustained water damage. Damages are reported and estimated; not all damages have been identified. Crop damages are unknown.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 34.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
