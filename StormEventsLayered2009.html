The airmass became very unstable with lifted indices falling to -10 to -15 C and most unstable CAPE rising to 5000 to 6000 J/kg.  Zero to 3 km CAPE rose to over 200 J/kg in northern Iowa by the late afternoon.  Surface temperatures rose to the 80s to low 90s, as dew point values reached the upper 60s to mid 70s.  Wind fields were somewhat weak, however effective shear was in the 35 to 50 kt range by late afternoon.  The amount of CAPE in the -10 to -30 layer of the atmosphere rose to over 400 J/kg by late afternoon.  Thunderstorms erupted in two places initially.  The first was along the northern boundary.  However the severe storms with this round remained to the north of Iowa.  A second round formed north of the southern boundary along the edge of the mid level cap.  The storms became severe and produced high winds and hail.  Thunderstorms from farther west moved into Iowa later in the evening and became severe.  The storms produced a weak Derecho.  Widespread winds of 60 to 70 MPH occurred with these storms, along with numerous reports of hail of 1 to 2 inches in diameter.  The initial round of storms produced large hail and gusty winds from southwest into central Iowa.  The second round resulted in winds of 60 to 70 MPH and large hail from central into southeast Iowa.  The highest wind gust was 74 MPH, measured at an RWIS site near Ankeny in Polk County.  The wind damage was largely to trees and power lines, with spotty reports of small shed and minor building damage.  A semi-tractor trailer was blown off of Interstate 35 near Highway 210 in Story County.  The high winds ripped siding off of a house in Ankeny in Polk county, and windows were blown out of a house in Colfax in Jasper County.  Thunderstorms rekindled on the back side of the main thunderstorm area after sunrise.  A few storms became severe and produced 60 MPH winds and golf ball size hail as they moved from The Fort Dodge area into Story County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Extensive tree and power line damage resulted in power outages up to several days long. Many power poles were snapped. Countywide, efforts to restore power were complicated by swampy fields, mud, and downed trees. Ninety-five percent of the county was without power at the peak of the outages. Numerous permanent structures were damaged, including major businesses in downtown Marion and Herrin. A total of 33 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed. It is estimated that over 10,000 homes in the county received minor damage (less than 50,000 dollars per house). Gas leaks were common. Most communication by phone was impossible, including cell phones. Stores were closed, making groceries and gas very difficult to obtain locally in the immediate aftermath of the storm. Travel was nearly impossible due to debris and trees blocking roads. While about two dozen people were treated for storm-related injuries at local hospitals, all but one of them was due to post-storm cleanup. Many school facilities were damaged. The roof of Carterville High School was severely damaged. Several windows were blown out of the school. Minor damage occurred at athletic facilities, including the roof blown off a baseball dugout. Many outbuildings and small structures were destroyed across the county. In Carterville, a garage was lifted and dropped on a vehicle. Many vehicles countywide were damaged or destroyed by falling tree and building debris. A state disaster declaration was granted. A dusk-to-dawn curfew was imposed, and a state of emergency was declared. The Williamson County airport near Marion reported a peak gust of 86 mph. Based on the most severe structural damage east of the airport, peak winds were estimated by storm surveyors close to 100 mph. There was extensive damage at the airport, including hangar buildings. A television station on Route 13 was knocked off the air due to structural and roof damage. All along Route 13, signs were blown down, power poles were down, and windows were smashed. Car dealerships along Route 13 sustained damage due to signs falling on vehicles and windows being blown out. Numerous structures sustained varying degrees of roof damage. A large hotel near the Interstate 57 interchange sustained major roof damage. Many trees were down along Interstate 57 from the Route 13 interchange northward, blocking the southbound lanes. Semis on the interstate were overturned or blown off the highway, causing extended traffic delays. One of the drivers of the semis was seriously injured. A tree fell on a van on the interstate. Damaged or destroyed trees were too numerous to count. Cleanup was expected to last through Labor Day, according to the Mayor of Marion.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 175.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Widespread damage to trees, power lines, and structures occurred as the comma head of a bow echo moved east across the county. In the city of Carbondale alone, officials reported 34 properties were deemed total losses from the storm. All but nine of those properties were mobile homes. Damage in the city alone (excluding Southern Illinois University) was estimated near 3 million dollars. Officials estimated about 3,000 trees were down or damaged in Carbondale alone, including the campus of Southern Illinois University. Officials in Murphysboro reported 17 dwellings in that city were total losses. One mobile home was blown over onto a car. Murphysboro officials also reported a police cruiser, a truck, and a mobile command center were destroyed. The city's public works garage was shifted off its foundation, and the city police station was damaged. The peak gust recorded by the automated system at the Carbondale airport was 81 mph before the system failed. An observer at the airport visually observed a separate anemometer located on the rooftop reach 106 mph.  The automated system measured a sustained wind of 68 mph before failing. Numerous permanent structures and vehicles were damaged countywide.  Small outbuildings were destroyed. The roof of a school collapsed. Carbondale was virtually impassable due to debris. One fatality occurred on Old Route 13 in Murphysboro when a large tree limb fell on a home, knocking an elderly man down a flight of stairs and causing a severe head injury. Emergency responders were delayed by blocked roads. A state disaster declaration was granted for Jackson County. A curfew and state of emergency was declared. Cleanup was expected to take most or all of the summer. Hundreds of trees were blown down in parks, which were closed indefinitely. The preliminary damage estimate for Southern Illinois University was 5 million dollars. Many buildings on campus sustained roof damage. The storm blew out nearly 100 windows in residence halls. Countywide, efforts to restore power were complicated by swampy fields, mud, and downed trees. Eighty-seven percent of the county was without power at the peak of the outages. Widespread power and telephone outages complicated recovery efforts. Most roads were blocked by debris and downed trees. Gas stations were closed in many areas, adding to problems obtaining fuel for generators. Red Cross shelters were opened in Carbondale and Murphysboro. Major grocery stores were closed for at least 12 to 24 hours, and much of their frozen food was lost. Most communication by cell phone and land line was impossible.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several storms evolved into supercells, and produced very large hail, destructive winds, and weak tornadoes.||Thunderstorms initiated around 14:00 CST over the central South Plains, and quickly became severe with large hail initially reported in Lubbock (Lubbock County). More intense and organized supercell storms formed over the Rolling Plains by the mid to late afternoon hours, however, and moved southeastward. One particularly organized and long-lived high precipitation supercell impacted the Aspermont vicinity of Stonewall County, where it produced a swath of damaging winds and at least one tornado. A 100 mph wind gust and a corresponding 32 millibar pressure drop was measured when the tornado struck the Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet site northeast of Aspermont. Although no injuries were reportedly related to the tornado, severe gusts north of Aspermont overturned a tractor trailer truck injuring the driver.||Additional supercells impacted portions of Briscoe and Hale Counties, and very large wind-blown hail caused damages in both counties. Two tornadoes were observed by storm chasers in the Silverton and Quitaque vicinity of southern Briscoe County.  ||Total economic damages were estimated near $650,000 across the South Plains region.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A massive high precipitation supercell storm tracked southeastward over Stonewall County during the 17:00 CST hour on the 13th. The storm produced a large swath of damaging winds as it impacted areas near Aspermont. A Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet site northeast of the city sustained a direct hit from a weak tornado which was embedded within the parent mesocyclone.||Skywarn storm spotters and storm chasers initially reported thunderstorm winds estimated between 70 mph and 80 mph along U.S. Highway 83 north of Aspermont at 17:22 CST. At approximately the same time, the onset of severe 60 mph gusts occurred at the Aspermont mesonet station. Severe gusts persisted for thirty minutes at the mesonet site, and local law enforcement officials reported that a tractor-trailer was blown over near the intersection of U.S. Highways 83 and 380 northeast of Aspermont at 17:34 CST. The driver of the truck was treated for minor injuries and released. The passage of a tornado at the site was well-corroborated by detailed pressure analyses, storm chaser accounts, and post-storm surveys at 17:30 CST. Although the highest wind speeds measured by the mesonet station during the event were tornadic in nature, a peak non-tornadic wind gust of 76 mph was recorded at 17:45 CST, ten minutes after the tornado had passed.||A post-storm survey by Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet meteorologists revealed that utility poles were snapped along a three mile swath northeast of Aspermont. Minor damages to light weight structures and trailers was additionally common, along with wind damage to native mesquite trees and one center irrigation pivot system was destroyed. The most significant structural damage occurred three miles east of Aspermont just south of U.S. Highway 380, where a the roof was blown off of a well-constructed farm house and a large horse bard was substantially damaged. This damage was deemed to have most likely resulted from outflow winds given that all debris from the structures was blown downwind toward the southeast.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Major flooding was noted in many other areas of north and central Georgia, including the eastern suburbs of Atlanta, northwest Georgia, and parts of central Georgia.  The culprit was a very stagnant upper atmospheric pattern featuring a weak upper low that developed in early September across south Texas and slowly migrated east-northeast through September 22nd, until a more significant upper trough dropping south into the southern plains finally moved the pesky upper low northeast of Georgia.  In addition, an unusually deep tropical flow was noted throughout this period.  Precipitable water values exceeded 2.0 inches across the area during much of this period, resulting in extremely efficient rain producing cells.  Persistent heavy rain showers and thunderstorms began to plague the area on the 16th, and persisted daily through the 21st across parts of north and central Georgia.||However, the catastrophic flooding unfolded when a sea breeze moving northwest merged with existing outflow boundaries and higher terrain across the western suburbs of Atlanta to result in persistent heavy thunderstorms for a period of at least 12 hours that trained across the same counties west of Atlanta, generally affecting Carroll, Douglas, Paulding and Cobb counties.  As the activity progressed across the state, significant flooding unfolded further east, including Fulton county, and the city of Atlanta, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties.  Incredible rainfall amounts of 15 to over 20 inches, were observed from northeast Carroll, through much of Douglas, into eastern Paulding and southern Cobb counties.  Rainfall amounts of 10 to 15 inches were noted across parts of Fulton, Dekalb, and Gwinnett.  Rainfall amounts of 8 to 12 inches were noted in other more spotty areas of northwest, north central, and central Georgia during this period.||The excessive rainfall on top of saturated ground resulted in some of the worst flooding ever reported in the Atlanta and north Georgia area.  Eleven deaths were recorded during the event, mostly vehicle related deaths at night from washed out bridges and roads as a result of swollen creeks.  Property damages are estimated to be at least $0.5 Billion, with hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed by flood waters.  Bridges on several state and local highways were washed out and some will take months to even a year to replace.   Eighteen counties (Bartow, Carroll, Chattooga, Cherokee, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Heard, Newton, Paulding, Rockdale, Stephens, and Walker) received a presidential disaster declaration as a result of the historic floods.  Twenty-one counties were declared eligible for public assistance, including several central Georgia counties that were affected by flash flooding earlier in the period.||Some of the worst flooding was observed along Sweetwater Creek near the Cobb, Fulton, Douglas county line.  Hundreds of homes were flooded and destroyed as the waters of Sweetwater Creek rose more than 20 feet above flood level.||Many main stem and secondary creeks, streams, and rivers across north and central Georgia, particularly in northwest and west central Georgia, reached record flood levels.

The final flood victim of the September 20th and 21st record flood event was claimed in Chattooga county as a 14-year old boy attempted to rescue an individual from a vehicle caught in flood waters of the Chattooga River near Trion.  The boy drowned in the flood waters during this attempt.  The Chattooga River near Summerville rose above its flood stage of 14 feet at 904 am EDT and remained in flood for several hours throughout the day.

A portion of Interstate-20 near Fairburn Road was closed for nearly 12-hours causing major traffic backups throughout the region.  The main line of the Norfolk-Southern railroad near Villa Rica was also washed out.  A seventh person in Douglas county fell victim to the raging flood waters.  A 29-year old female perished when she was swept away in her vehicle by flood waters from the Dog River at 451 am EDT.  Over 1200 residents in the county were left without power as several tress in water logged soils fell on adjacent power lines.  This primarily affected areas near and including Arbor Place Mall along Interstate-20 near Fairburn Road.  Schools throughout the county were closed because of many impassable and flooded roads.

Several rural and some city roads were closed due to high water. Trailer homes along the Neosho River on Highway 400 near Parsons were partially submerged. Flooding extended into the evening hours of May 4th. Sadly, two people were killed sometime during the overnight hours of the 27th or the early morning hours of the 28th, after attempting to traverse a flooded low water bridge crossing in their vehicle due to the swollen Pumpkin Creek just east of Mound Valley on 15000 Road. The strong current swept their vehicle 200 feet downstream, likely trapping the two victims. The vehicle was found overturned and submerged in about 10 feet of water.

Strong southerly flow was found ahead of this storm system with dewpoint temperatures in the lower to middle 60s noted northward to the Interstate 20 corridor of northeast Texas and northern Louisiana. Impressive deep layer shear was noted in the warm sector across the region which was conducive for discrete storm cells during the afternoon and evening across northeast Texas. These storms spawned tornadoes and produced large hail across portions of northeast Texas. The storm system moved eastward during the predawn hours of December 24th with again, numerous storms producing tornadoes across southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana. In addition to all the storm damage...these storms were prolific rain makers with numerous reports of flash flooding across the region as well.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF3 tornado touched down on the south side of Lufkin, on Loop 287 near Olive Garden just west of the intersections Loop 287 and South Chestnut Street. The tornado then tracked north northeast causing roof and tree damage to several homes behind Morgan Insurance Company on Loop 287. The tornado continued its north northeastward track then crossed South Chestnut causing major damage|to Gibson Funeral Home. It then tracked northward through a residential neighborhood causing more tree and roof damage, before destroying Max Welding Shop on Denman Rd. The tornado crossed Denman Road moving through another residential area causing moderate to major tree and roof damage. The tornado then destroyed the VFW building just before crossing Lufkin Avenue. More residential damage was observed between Lufkin Avenue and Atkinson Drive. The tornado crossed Atkinson Drive causing major damage by tossing several 18-wheelers parked at a trucking|company on Loop 287. The tornado then crossed Loop 287, damaging Goodyear Tires and Jim Walter Homes. The storm then tracked north into a wooded area before reaching Kit McConnico Park and causing moderate to major damage to the park.

This created atmospheric dynamics favorable for severe weather, with the only limiting factor being modest instability. A warm front over the area during the morning moved rapidly north in response to increasing southerly flow allowing a gradual increase in low level instability. By afternoon several severe weather events and three tornadoes occurred over portions of southeast Georgia.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado first touched down at approximately 1415EST in northwest Pierce County near Merson Road and Crump Road. It crossed the Big Satilla Creek, entering into Appling County at this point, and continued on a northeast track. The funnel may have briefly lifted off the ground at this point. The next significant damage occurred along Metts-Overstreet Road with the complete destruction of a singlewide mobile home and a farm shed at approximately 1425EST. Additionally, at this location, a brick cider block structure had one wall knocked over. The tornado then moved into a dairy just west of the intersection of State Road 15 and Wireglass Road. The event was rated as an EF-2 with winds of 135 mph at this location. Three metal building structures were destroyed with one removed from its foundation and blown into a pile of scrap metal. It is possible the funnel may have approached EF-3 at this particular location with winds of 140 to 150 mph; however, other damage to frame and masonry structures at the dairy suggested a lower wind value should be assigned to this area. One individual escaped injury by jumping into a depressed area inside one of the structures before it blew down around her. East of State Road 15, along Wireglass Road, extensive tree blow down and snapping continued in a tree farm. Once again the funnel likely lifted off the ground touching down again at 1430EST near 4230 Antioch Church Road destroying a doublewide mobile home. At this location, two middle aged individuals were in the bedroom, preparing for work, when the funnel destroyed the mobile home. Both escaped with only minor cuts despite the fact that the doublewide was completely obliterated and the frames bent. Once again at this location the winds were rated at 135 mph for a strong EF-2 rating.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado crossed Highway 13 and caused roof damage to a home on the east side of the highway, before moving into the Atwood Acres subdivision. Here, the tornado caused major damage to 4 well-constructed homes and minor to moderate damage to approximately 26 other homes across the eastern half of the subdivision.

The tornado continued northeastward and damaged another home just north of the subdivision, before passing through unaccessible forested areas. Several more trees were damagd at the Ellis Road/Parish Road 4-46 intersection. Curving more northward, the tornado moved generally along and just east of Ellis Road, with one barn destroyed at the intersection with Floyd Williams Road, and one oil storage tank blown down east of the Rifle Lane intersection.

The tornado first touched down near Williard, west of Eatonton and continued on an east-southeastward track toward, lifting very near the Hancock county line.  Much of the resulting damage occurred near Glenwood Springs Road.  A restaurant and two other commercial buildings were completely destroyed on the southwest side of Eatonton.  At least one person was injured from debris in this area.  A number of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the path of the tornado, along with many downed power lines.

An unseasonably warm and unstable air mass developed in advance of the cold front during the late afternoon and early evening across north and central Georgia as warm, moist air rode northward into Georgia on a strong low-level jet.  Afternoon temperatures in the 70s and dewpoints in the 60s, combined with strong shear and moderate instability, resulted in the development of numerous supercell thunderstorms from mid-afternoon until a few hours after midnight on the 19th.  Ten tornadoes, ranging in scale from EF0 to EF3 tracked across several north and central Georgia counties.  The worst tornadoes affected the east central Georgia counties of Jasper, Putnam, Hancock, and Jasper.  A death was observed in Hancock county with an EF3 tornado and several injuries were reported from Putnam and Hancock counties.  In addition to the tornadoes, very large hail occurred with several of the thunderstorms, including four-inch diameter hail in Coweta and Fayette counties just south of Atlanta.  Numerous reports of golf ball and larger-sized hail were received.  The event resulted in millions of dollars of damage and the destruction of several homes in north and central Georgia counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An aerial and ground survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in cooperation with the Putnam County Emergency Management Director confirmed that an EF1 tornado carved an approximate 8-9 mile track across Putnam county very near Georgia Highway 16.  The tornado first touched down near Williard, west of Eatonton and continued on an east-southeastward track toward, lifting very near the Hancock county line.  Much of the resulting damage occurred near Glenwood Springs Road.  A restaurant and two other commercial buildings were completely destroyed on the southwest side of Eatonton.  At least one person was injured from debris in this area.  A number of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the path of the tornado, along with many downed power lines.  U.S. Highway 129, south of Eatonton, was closed for several hours as it was blocked from numerous downed trees and power lines.  Several individuals were trapped in their vehicles in this area.

Another home was pushed off its pillars and peeled all the tin off the roof, this occurred on County Road 24. The tornado then crossed County Road 2422 and downed many more trees, tore part of the roof off one home and damaged an old shed. Another old structure had some of the tin roof peeled off. The tornado crossed into Newton County at 2:52 am. It then crossed Griffis Fountain Road. The tornado crossed Parks Mill Road and dissipated just to the east of that point.

This tornado first touched down about one half mile west of FM 134, continuing east across FM 9 about 3 miles north of Waskom, before entering western Caddo Parish. Numerous trees were uprooted and snapped, especially east of FM 9, and across Highway 169. This tornado followed North Lakeshore Drive, with numerous homes damaged, some of which had their roofs partially removed. In addition, one of the homes was moved off of its foundation. Near I-220 and Blanchard Road, 12 empty railroad cars were blown off the track, with intermittent damage along Blanchard Road going into downtown Shreveport. Large tree limbs and power lines were downed, while road signs were downed as well. The tornado crossed the Red River south of the Diamond Jacks Casino, where numerous homes were damaged due to trees between Arthur Ray Teague Parkway and Barksdale Blvd. On Barksdale Blvd itself, numerous power poles were downed, with many businesses damaged, and damage to the west gate of Barksdale Air Force Base. The tornado lifted in eastern Bossier Parish along Highway 157 south of Haughton. This tornado was rated an EF2, with winds of around 120 mph, and the most extensive damage found in the Lakeview Subdivision on the north side of Cross Lake in Caddo Parish. The total path length from Harrison County Texas through Bossier Parish Louisiana was 38.5 miles. The path width fluctuated through this continuous track, varying from between 100 to 400 yards.  There were 2 injuries reported in Caddo Parish...the first was in the Lakeview subdivision and the second was a female who was trapped in her car after a tree fell on the automobile.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This caused a surface low pressure system to move from western Nebraska into southeast South Dakota during that time.  As the low tracked northeast, a dry-line moved into eastern Nebraska during the afternoon of March 23rd.  With surface temperatures in the 60s and 70s, and dewpoint temperatures in the 50s, ample instability was in place to allow a line of severe thunderstorms to develop as the dry-line punched eastward.  Several fast moving low-topped supercell thunderstorms were embedded in the line, and one cell produced cyclic tornadoes from southeast of Lincoln into western Iowa.  The storms in the line were moving north northeast at 50 to 60 mph.  In addition to the severe weather, strong southerly gradient winds prevailed ahead of the low pressure.  In some cases the winds gusted between 50 and 65 mph for several hours across parts of eastern Nebraska.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the fourth of 5 cyclic tornadoes that a low-topped supercell thunderstorm produced at it tracked southeast through east of the Lincoln area.

Footage of the tornado was taken by witnesses along the Pennyrile Parkway and shown on a local media outlet. Peak winds were estimated near 140 mph. The tornado tracked a short distance into Hopkins County before lifting.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This cell then back-built south-southwest along a boundary during the late afternoon, producing a complex of strong to severe cells farther inland. A waterspout developed within the initial severe cell offshore of Ormond Beach and moved onto the beach as a tornado, reaching the adjacent backyard of several homes just beyond the beach. This vortex, or more likely other vorticies associated with the same cell then meandered south along the beach and near-shore Atlantic waters for about ten minutes (about 3 minutes over or near the beach). Early in the evening, another tornado (rated EF0) developed inland over Port Orange and damaged over 150 manufactured/mobile homes before lifting. One person sustained minor injuries from broken glass. Also, between Ormond Beach and Port Orange, a man was struck and injured by lightning.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A NWS ground survey of damage revealed a weak EF0 tornado touched down in the extreme northeast portion of the Lighthouse Point mobile home community. The tornado continued south-southwest and strengthened to a strong EF0 tornado within the Laurelwood manufactured home community, then lifted in the extreme northwest portion of the Brandy Hills subdivision. Light debris (insulation, styrofoam) was deposited up to 2 miles downstream (south-southeast) from where the tornado lifted. 154 homes sustained damage: 3 uninhabitable, 60 major damage, 43 minor damage, 48 very minimal damage. One man sustained a minor injury, due to cuts from broken glass. EF assessment: DI3, DOD4, LB-EXP.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This resulted in 10 tornadoes across the mid state, with one being an EF4 Tornado in Murfreesboro in Rutherford County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF-4 Tornado...with maximum estimated wind speed around 170 mph, was reached in the Highland Park Drive Neighborhood as well as the|Tomahawk Trace Area. Several well constructed homes were destroyed|in those areas, hardwood trees were debarked, and vehicles were tossed|considerable distances.

Path length was 23.25 miles and maximum width was 750 yards.||Gound surveys of the Murfreesboro tornado indicate that the actual initial touchdown was just north of the Eagleville Community in far|Southwestern Rutherford County. Intermittent tree and roof damage was |noted beginning at a residence near the intersection of Kelly Road and|Highway 41A. Intermittent tree damage continued northeast, with the path becoming continuous along Rocky Grove Road between the Cedar Grove |and Pleasant Hill Communities. The survey team then inspected continuous|damage from Rocky Grove Road northeast to a residence on Newman Road approximately 2 miles north of the Windrow Community. Extensive tree damage was noted along the path...along with multiple instances of roof damage to homes.||The most significant damage was on Patterson Road 1/2 mile west of Windrow. A brick home was completely destroyed and thrown almost|completely off its foundation. ||Additional areas between Stones River Battlefield and Medical Center |Parkway in Murfreesboro were surveyed. Two homes on Wilkinson Pike and two homes on Highland Park Drive were completely destroyed. One of the homes did appear to be properly anchored to it's foundation while three|were not. Per a newspaper report, at Stones River Battlefield, a quarter mile swath of fallen and damaged trees streched one mile across the battlefield, along with numerous fences being destroyed, closing parts of the park to tourists. One particular fallen tree damaged a 60 foot section of the national cemetary wall and a cannon display.||Additional information about the tornado included it tracked due northeast for the first 9 miles then began a steady turn to the right. By the time the tornado lifted it was moving to the east-southeast. Additionally, videos of the tornado indicated a multiple vortex appearance to the tornado and the aerial survey was able to detect focused areas of damage within the larger path.||The aeriel survey revealed 12 to 15 homes which were completely destroyed and dozens others which suffered significant damage. A 2-story office building had the complete upper floor removed.|Numerous large vehicles were picked up and tossed, including|several semi trailers which wound up piled together near the|intersection of Thompson Lane and Broad Street. Significant roof|damage and some wall collapse on homes were also noted.|Several well built homes suffered significant exterior and|interior wall failure. ||Three other areas received significant damage. The first area was along Bushnell Drive just north of Compton Road. A well built 2-storty brick home was almost completely destroyed with just part of the kitchen wall remaining standing. The second area was near the intersection of Haynes Drive and Sulphur Springs Road. Three homes on Cornwall Court were completely destroyed and thrown clear of their slab foundations, however|it did not appear any of the homes was properly anchored.||The third area of enhanced damage was along Battleground Drive between |D\`Ann Drive and Tomahawk Trace. The National Weather Service Assessment team was joined by a Murfreesboro Code who assisted with assessing construction quality at this location. Three homes were completely  blown clear of their foundations and destroyed. One home was not |anchored/fastened to the foundation, however, the other 2 were very well constructed.

From their eye witness accounts, and from video obtained by the Dickinson Police Department, it is likely that this was a rain-wrapped tornado, and very difficult if not impossible to see. The tornado occurred before sunset, yet it was described as being as dark as night during the event.||The conclusion of the damage survey was that this tornado touched down around a mile or so outside the city limits, on the southwest side, and moved east-northeast, passing through the far southern part of the city. It lifted back into the parent thunderstorm on the extreme southeast side of Dickinson near the city limit. This occurred in the window between 815 PM MDT and 830 PM MDT.||Over 450 structures were damaged, of which nearly 100 were declared completely destroyed or beyond repair. Numerous vehicles were damaged or destroyed, some were on their roofs. Power lines were snapped, knocking out power to most of Dickinson, and tree damage was extensive. Two minor injuries were reported, with no deaths. The injuries were to a 23 year old male and a 42 year old male. Both occurred in homes.||The worst damage surveyed was between the Heart River and roughly 8th Street Southwest and 8th Street Southeast in southern Dickinson. Of that damage, the absolute worst corresponded to middle EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Tornado Scale. From that it was determined that peak wind speeds in the tornado were on the order of 150 mph.||Other parts of Dickinson and the surrounding area sustained wind damage likely associated with the rear flank downdraft of the storm.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

However, more substantial damage again occurred from Larsens Lane northeast to Fox Run Road and Essig Lane.  More damage occurred as the tornado crossed Stroudsmoor Road, where numerous trees were felled, and roof damage occurred to the Stroudsmoor Country Inn. A downed tree also damaged a home on Stroudsmoor Road. Another downed tree damaged a home on Pennsylvania State Route 191. The tornado lifted just before it moved over the intersections of Routes 191 and 611 (Foxtwon Hill Road) just south of Stroudsburg.

Thirty percent of the trees on the property were destroyed . ||The tornado then lifted, causing only relatively minor damage as it followed Middle Road into Stroud Township. However, more substantial damage again occurred from Larsens Lane northeast to Fox Run Road and Essig Lane.  More damage occurred as the tornado crossed Stroudsmoor Road, where numerous trees were felled, and roof damage occurred to the Stroudsmoor Country Inn. A downed tree also damaged a home on Stroudsmoor Road. Another downed tree damaged a home on Pennsylvania State Route 191. The tornado lifted just before it moved over the intersections of Routes 191 and 611 (Foxtwon Hill Road) just south of Stroudsburg. The tornado was on the ground for about 4.6 miles and its maximum width was about 100 yards. Damage was estimated at 1 million dollars.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Strong shear was in place across the region such that several tornadic thunderstorms developed...producing widespread wind damage across portions of northeast Texas, southwest Arkansas as well as northern Louisiana. These storms trained across the same general area such that flooding was widespread. Flooding was severe across northwest Louisiana where flooding was reported in many homes and businesses. Area bayous, creeks, rivers and lakes were already at high levels from the excessive heavy rainfall that fell earlier in the month. Thus, some lakes and bayous approached and succeeded their all time record stage levels.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado snapped several trees causing a shut down of Interstate 20, as trees fell across the interstate.  It then continued north damaging several homes in the Eastwood Community.  Structural damage was observed to several homes due to fallen trees and nearly 30 homes had significant roof damage.  The tornado then continued north across Hwy. 80 into the Eastwood Golf Course.  Numerous trees were snapped and uprooted on the Golf Course.  The damage track dissipated north of Eastwood Golf Course before reaching Winfield Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado then crossed into Carter County, with sporadic damage noted in the sparsely populated areas in the southwest part of the county. The tornado appeared to reach its maximum width and intensity as it approached and moved through Lone Grove. The tornado destroyed or severely damaged numerous mobile homes, homes and businesses in and around Lone Grove. Numerous mobile homes were completely obliterated with few recognizable pieces left. EF4 damage was noted at two locations, one in Lone Grove and the other in the Majestic Hills area north of Ardmore. Numerous vehicles were rolled or thrown, some for considerable distances. Six of the fatalities occurred in mobile homes and one in a well-built home that sustained EF4 damage. The eighth fatality occurred when a truck driving south on Interstate 35 was hit by the tornado killing the driver. ||The tornado continued northeast, with major damage reported in the Majestic Hills addition and crossing Interstate-35 about a mile and a half north of the Prairie Valley Road exit. At least eight homes and a small private school were destroyed in the Majestic Hills neighborhood. It moved through rural areas of Northeast Carter County to the east of Springer. Approximately 46 people were injured, with 14 seriously injured. Eight people died in the Lone Grove area. At least 114 homes were damaged or destroyed, with at least 3500 losing power in and around Carter county. Debris from this tornado was picked up as far away as Sulphur.

Major flooding was noted in many other areas of north and central Georgia, including the eastern suburbs of Atlanta, northwest Georgia, and parts of central Georgia.  The culprit was a very stagnant upper atmospheric pattern featuring a weak upper low that developed in early September across south Texas and slowly migrated east-northeast through September 22nd, until a more significant upper trough dropping south into the southern plains finally moved the pesky upper low northeast of Georgia.  In addition, an unusually deep tropical flow was noted throughout this period.  Precipitable water values exceeded 2.0 inches across the area during much of this period, resulting in extremely efficient rain producing cells.  Persistent heavy rain showers and thunderstorms began to plague the area on the 16th, and persisted daily through the 21st across parts of north and central Georgia.||However, the catastrophic flooding unfolded when a sea breeze moving northwest merged with existing outflow boundaries and higher terrain across the western suburbs of Atlanta to result in persistent heavy thunderstorms for a period of at least 12 hours that trained across the same counties west of Atlanta, generally affecting Carroll, Douglas, Paulding and Cobb counties.  As the activity progressed across the state, significant flooding unfolded further east, including Fulton county, and the city of Atlanta, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties.  Incredible rainfall amounts of 15 to over 20 inches, were observed from northeast Carroll, through much of Douglas, into eastern Paulding and southern Cobb counties.  Rainfall amounts of 10 to 15 inches were noted across parts of Fulton, Dekalb, and Gwinnett.  Rainfall amounts of 8 to 12 inches were noted in other more spotty areas of northwest, north central, and central Georgia during this period.||The excessive rainfall on top of saturated ground resulted in some of the worst flooding ever reported in the Atlanta and north Georgia area.  Eleven deaths were recorded during the event, mostly vehicle related deaths at night from washed out bridges and roads as a result of swollen creeks.  Property damages are estimated to be at least $0.5 Billion, with hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed by flood waters.  Bridges on several state and local highways were washed out and some will take months to even a year to replace.   Eighteen counties (Bartow, Carroll, Chattooga, Cherokee, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Heard, Newton, Paulding, Rockdale, Stephens, and Walker) received a presidential disaster declaration as a result of the historic floods.  Twenty-one counties were declared eligible for public assistance, including several central Georgia counties that were affected by flash flooding earlier in the period.||Some of the worst flooding was observed along Sweetwater Creek near the Cobb, Fulton, Douglas county line.  Hundreds of homes were flooded and destroyed as the waters of Sweetwater Creek rose more than 20 feet above flood level.||Many main stem and secondary creeks, streams, and rivers across north and central Georgia, particularly in northwest and west central Georgia, reached record flood levels.  Many of these same creeks, streams, and rivers remained in flood for several days.  In some cases, all time record flood levels were recorded.  The following is a list of new record flood levels set on several creeks, streams, and rivers in north and west Georgia.  Noonday Creek near Woodstock rose to 19.6 feet on the 21st at 530 pm EDT.  The previous record was 16.30 feet set on July 11, 2005.  Nickajack Creek at Mableton reached 19.30 feet on the 22nd at 215 am EDT.  The previous record was 16.60 feet set on July 11, 2005.

The all time record is 31.60 feet set on December 10, 1919.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Catastrophic flash flooding began to unfold across portions of Gwinnett county during the early morning hours of the 21st as a secondary area of very heavy rain and thunderstorms began to expand across the eastern Atlanta metropolitan counties.  Rainfall exceeded 12 inches in portions of the county during the night and early morning hours.  USGS stream gages verified that significant flooding was underway.  Crooked Creek at Norcross exceeded its flood stage of 11 feet at 306 am EDT.  Pew Creek near Lawrenceville reached its flood stage of 11 feet at 418 am EDT.  Many roads became flooded and impassable as they were submerged by several feet of water in some areas.  A 39-year old female lost her life as her vehicle was washed off Desiree Drive and she was carried away in the flood waters of a small tributary feeding into the Yellow River.  Many homes, apartments, businesses and roads from Norcross to Lawrenceville to Lilburn were flooded during this time frame.

Major flooding was noted in many other areas of north and central Georgia, including the eastern suburbs of Atlanta, northwest Georgia, and parts of central Georgia.  The culprit was a very stagnant upper atmospheric pattern featuring a weak upper low that developed in early September across south Texas and slowly migrated east-northeast through September 22nd, until a more significant upper trough dropping south into the southern plains finally moved the pesky upper low northeast of Georgia.  In addition, an unusually deep tropical flow was noted throughout this period.  Precipitable water values exceeded 2.0 inches across the area during much of this period, resulting in extremely efficient rain producing cells.  Persistent heavy rain showers and thunderstorms began to plague the area on the 16th, and persisted daily through the 21st across parts of north and central Georgia.||However, the catastrophic flooding unfolded when a sea breeze moving northwest merged with existing outflow boundaries and higher terrain across the western suburbs of Atlanta to result in persistent heavy thunderstorms for a period of at least 12 hours that trained across the same counties west of Atlanta, generally affecting Carroll, Douglas, Paulding and Cobb counties.  As the activity progressed across the state, significant flooding unfolded further east, including Fulton county, and the city of Atlanta, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties.  Incredible rainfall amounts of 15 to over 20 inches, were observed from northeast Carroll, through much of Douglas, into eastern Paulding and southern Cobb counties.  Rainfall amounts of 10 to 15 inches were noted across parts of Fulton, Dekalb, and Gwinnett.  Rainfall amounts of 8 to 12 inches were noted in other more spotty areas of northwest, north central, and central Georgia during this period.||The excessive rainfall on top of saturated ground resulted in some of the worst flooding ever reported in the Atlanta and north Georgia area.  Eleven deaths were recorded during the event, mostly vehicle related deaths at night from washed out bridges and roads as a result of swollen creeks.  Property damages are estimated to be at least $0.5 Billion, with hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed by flood waters.  Bridges on several state and local highways were washed out and some will take months to even a year to replace.   Eighteen counties (Bartow, Carroll, Chattooga, Cherokee, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Heard, Newton, Paulding, Rockdale, Stephens, and Walker) received a presidential disaster declaration as a result of the historic floods.  Twenty-one counties were declared eligible for public assistance, including several central Georgia counties that were affected by flash flooding earlier in the period.||Some of the worst flooding was observed along Sweetwater Creek near the Cobb, Fulton, Douglas county line.  Hundreds of homes were flooded and destroyed as the waters of Sweetwater Creek rose more than 20 feet above flood level.||Many main stem and secondary creeks, streams, and rivers across north and central Georgia, particularly in northwest and west central Georgia, reached record flood levels.  Many of these same creeks, streams, and rivers remained in flood for several days.  In some cases, all time record flood levels were recorded.  The following is a list of new record flood levels set on several creeks, streams, and rivers in north and west Georgia.  Noonday Creek near Woodstock rose to 19.6 feet on the 21st at 530 pm EDT.  The previous record was 16.30 feet set on July 11, 2005.  Nickajack Creek at Mableton reached 19.30 feet on the 22nd at 215 am EDT.  The previous record was 16.60 feet set on July 11, 2005.  The North Fork of Peachtree Creek at Atlanta rose to 18.07 feet on the 21st at 715 pm EDT.  The previous record was 17.70 feet set on September 16, 2004.  Utoy Creek near Atlanta rose to 27.04 feet on the 22nd at 1000 am EDT.  The previous record was 16.86 feet set on May 6, 2003.  The Chattahoochee River at Whitesburg rose to 29.61 feet on the 21st at 745 pm EDT.  The previous record was 29.11 feet on December 11, 1919.  Suwanee Creek at Suwanee rose to 14.30 feet on the 21st at 645 pm EDT.  The previous record was 12.04 feet set on October 5, 1996.  The Yellow River at Lithonia rose to 25.50 feet on the 22nd at 515 am EDT.  The previous record was 17.53 feet set on May 7, 2003.  The Yellow River near Conyers below Milstead rose to 22.54 feet on the 22nd at 500 pm EDT.  The previous record was 16.36 feet set on July 8, 2005.  The Chattahoochee River at Franklin rose to 29.98 feet on the 22nd at 500 pm EDT.  The previous record was 28.40 feet set on December 15, 1919.  The Sweetwater Creek at Austell rose to 30.17 feet on the 22nd at 1000 pm EDT.  The previous record was 21.81 feet on July 12, 2005.||The following rivers reached flood levels that were within the top five all time levels at these locations.  Peachtree Creek in Atlanta rose to 23.89 feet on the 21st at 915 pm EDT.  The all time record is 25.80 feet recorded on December 20th, 1919.  Nancy Creek in Atlanta reached 14.69 feet on the 21st at 930 pm EDT.  The all time record is 15.50 feet on December 1, 1973.  The Chattahoochee River at Vinings reached 28.10 feet on the 22nd at 1200 am EDT.  The all time record is 29.0 feet set on December 10, 1919.  The South Fork of the Peachtree Creek reached 15.21 feet on the 22nd at 1200 am EDT.  The all time record is 29.0 feet set on December 10, 1976.  The Chattahoochee River at Campbellton reached 30.55 feet on the 22nd at 300 pm EDT.  The all time record is 31.60 feet set on December 10, 1919.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous emergency management sources, as well as local law enforcement, newspapers, broadcast media, and National Weather Service surveys confirmed that record and catastrophic flash flooding began across Douglas county during this time frame.  Repeated rounds of thunderstorms with heavy rain tracked from southwest to northeast.  Flash flooding was observed in most parts of the county during this time frame.  Up to six inches of rain fell in this area on already saturated ground.  Rain continued overnight beyond this time frame, with some parts of the county receiving nearly 22 inches by the afternoon of the 21st.  Hundreds of homes and businesses were impacted before the flooding subsided, many totally destroyed.  Dozens of roads and bridges were were washed out as well, including some major roads such as Georgia Highway 166.  Some roads, including Georgia Highway 166 will be closed for up to a year while washed out bridges are repaired.  In addition, Douglas county suffered six flash flood deaths during this event, the most of any county from the historical floods in late September 2009.  Flash flood deaths are documented as follows.  The first flash flood death occurred at 1030 pm EDT when a 44-year old female was attempting to cross Mobley Creek at Banks Mill Road and was swept away in her Jeep Liberty.  The second flash flood death occurred at 1100 pm EDT when a 29-year old male was swept way in his sport utility vehicle while attempting to cross Pool Creek at Poole Mill Road.  The third flash flood death was that of a 26-year old female who also was attempting to cross Mobley Creek at Banks Mill Road.  The fourth flash flood death was that of a 27-year old male attempting to cross Town Branch Creek at Mann Road.  The fifth flash flood death in Douglas county occurred where Stewart's Mill Road crosses Anneewakee Creek when a 49-year old nurse was swept away in her vehicle while attempting to cross the creek.  She was on her way to work at the time.  The sixth flash flood death in Douglas county was that of a 55-year old male.  He was swept away in his Ford Ranger pickup truck while attempting to cross West Bully Creek on North Helton Road.  Numerous other high water rescues took place.  Many took place via boat to rescue people from flood homes, businesses, and vehicles.||During this time frame, damage was estimated to be close to $1 million.  Damages rose into the millions overnight and Monday as the flooding continued and worsened.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.87M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These storms at times produced the full gamut of severe weather, including large hail, damaging winds, tornadoes and flooding. Portions of Marion, Harvey, Butler, Sedgwick and McPherson counties were especially affected by straight-line damaging winds, as a pair or bow echoes surged east to northeast across the area, inflicting damage to numerous barns, outbuildings and some other structures, uprooting trees and downing power poles. Additionally, a handful of relatively weak, short-lived tornadoes skipped across portions of Sumner, Cowley, Butler, Marion and Sedgwick counties during the afternoon and evening hours on the 25th and 26th. A tornado near Lake Afton in southwest Sedgwick county inflicted moderate damage to a residence, and also injured two people. Furthermore, heavy thunderstorms training over the same areas produced widespread areal flooding, river flooding and flash flooding across mainly south-central, east-central and southeast Kansas. Numerous rural and city roads were flooded and subsequently closed due to high water. Various water rescues were needed for stranded motorists, as well as homeowners threatened by flood waters. Numerous homes and businesses were flooded, along with the Cowley County Fairgrounds. Sadly, three flooding deaths occurred, one in Greenwood county and two in Labette county. Some injuries occurred as well.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rainfall from numerous thunderstorms during the afternoon, evening and overnight hours on the 26th produced widespread flooding across much of Harper county.

The front slowed down, which prolonged the rain. The result was widespread flash flooding, which gave way to areal flooding and river flooding. Winds changed direction and speed up through the atmosphere, a favorable condition for tornadoes.

This followed an earlier round of strong thunderstorms and heavy rains earlier in the day. Damage from the thunderstorm winds was widespread across the Niagara Frontier and Western Southern Tier.  Trees as large as two to three feet in diameter were downed. Power outages were scattered throughout the region as the winds downed power lines.|The unprecedented heavy rains that fell���four to six inches in less than two hours���resulted in some of the worst flash flooding the area has seen. Parts of Erie, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus and Allegany counties received State and Federal Disaster Declarations. In the Village of Silver Creek an entire mobile home park along Silver Creek was washed away. The flood waters continued through the heart of the village through the fire station, police headquarters and highway department. Several police cars, an ambulance and much of the town���s highway equipment were lost. In Irving, the flood waters flowed across parts of the New York State Thruway and Routes 5 and 20. Water flooded portions of Lakeshore Hospital there. Also in Irving, the Seneca Nation sustained almost two million dollars in damage to roads and bridges. In total, in Chautauqua county hundreds of homes were damaged and 45 homes were condemned, including the 35 mobile homes of the aforementioned park. In the Village of Gowanda (part of which is in Erie County and part in Cattaraugus county), extensive flash flooding occurred. Tri-County hospital in Gowanda was inundated by flood waters. Patients were transferred to Lakeshore Hospital in Irving. Several hundred homes sustained damage and 40 homes were condemned there. One fatality occurred in Gowanda as an 80-year-old man ventured out to check a bridge on his property and was swept away by the flood waters. The gage on Cattaraugus Creek at Gowanda showed a rise from six feet to near 13 feet in less than an hour (flood stage is 10 feet). Throughout Cattaraugus county over one-quarter of the roads were damaged or lost.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 45.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong push of warm air took place ahead of the low with 850 mb winds around 40 kts pushing into the central U.S.  Surface dew points rose to the mid 50s just south of Iowa during the afternoon with the 50 degree dew points reaching just north of the southern Iowa border.  At the same time, a strong polar high pressure area was poised over northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  Sub-zero temperatures reached as far south as the northern South Dakota border during the afternoon.  The atmosphere was marginally unstable with most unstable, elevated, CAPE values in the 500 to 1000 J/kg range in the afternoon.  Shear increased to between 30 and 45 kts with precipitable water values in the three quarters to one inch range over the southeast half of the state.  Thunderstorms in some form occurred through the day.  Over northern Iowa, they produced ice pellets and some small hail.  One half of an inch of ice pellet accumulation occurred in Emmet and Cerro Gordo Counties, with nearly an inch of ice pellet accumulation in Worth County.  These accumulations were the result of thunderstorms.  Thunderstorms were more intense over southeast Iowa.  The freezing level was relatively low, at 8200 feet, resulting in most of the storms producing hail of at least pea size.  Available CAPE was around 200 J/kg at the time.  Penny to quarter size hail fell in central Iowa, across the Des Moines metro area.  Lightning struck an overpass along Interstate 80/35 along the north side of the Des Moines metro area and knocked a chunk of concrete off of it.  The concrete fell onto the windshield of a moving van, smashing through the glass.  The driver was injured and admitted to the hospital with minor injuries.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Afternoon temperatures in the 70s and dewpoints in the 60s, combined with strong shear and moderate instability, resulted in the development of numerous supercell thunderstorms from mid-afternoon until a few hours after midnight on the 19th.  Ten tornadoes, ranging in scale from EF0 to EF3 tracked across several north and central Georgia counties.  The worst tornadoes affected the east central Georgia counties of Jasper, Putnam, Hancock, and Jasper.  A death was observed in Hancock county with an EF3 tornado and several injuries were reported from Putnam and Hancock counties.  In addition to the tornadoes, very large hail occurred with several of the thunderstorms, including four-inch diameter hail in Coweta and Fayette counties just south of Atlanta.

A few reports of large hail and damaging winds were received into the mid evening hours.  Isolated flash flooding occurred again in northeastern Madison County and in the town of Bridgeport in Jackson County where water depth climbed up to two feet.  One person was struck by lightning in the town of Fairview in Cullman County.

Despite the occurrence of thirteen tornadoes across the South Plains region, most of the damage resulted from destructive hail and heavy rainfall.  ||Thunderstorms first developed over the northern South Plains around 13:00 CST. These early afternoon storms initiated as supercells, but transitioned into a small-scale convective complex that produced extensive amounts of large hail and heavy rainfall. As the storms trained over the Interstate 27 corridor in Swisher County, a significant hail accumulation and flood event resulted in some 50 vehicles becoming stalled and a prolonged closure of the highway through the overnight hours.||Additional storms developed during the mid to late afternoon hours over the central South Plains. Two supercell thunderstorms impacted Lubbock County. One of these storms produced a destructive hail swath through the city of Lubbock damaging some 3,000 homes and more than 1,100 vehicles totaling an estimated $40 million in damages. Meanwhile a second supercell storm over eastern Lubbock County produced a family of weak tornadoes along U.S. Highway 82 east of Idalou. ||Other supercell storms impacted portions of Garza and Kent Counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. These storms additionally produced damaging hail and brief tornadoes.||By late evening, storm modes transitioned toward broken convective complexes and multicell structures. An unstable low-level environment, however, continued to be characterized by an increasingly enhanced veering of the wind fields. Thus, despite a transition toward less discrete storm cells, the threat for tornadoes remained. Multiple small scale low-level circulations developed within the evolving convective complexes, and these circulations proved to be tornadic. An EF-1 tornado damaged five structures and downed power poles as it tracked nearly eight miles across northwestern Lubbock County and southwestern Hale County around 20:00 CST. Two additional EF-1 tornadoes impacted the Abernathy (Hale County) and Roosevelt (Lubbock County) areas through the 21:00 CST hour. Meanwhile, similar tornadic circulations developed within other storm complexes over portions of Dickens, Kent, and King Counties. Multiple reports of tornadoes were received from rural areas around the Spur, Girard, and Guthrie vicinities but no damages resulted.||In all, an estimated $41.3 million in damages and three injuries resulted from severe weather across the South Plains region of west Texas on the 16th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Giant two and a half inch hail stones fell over the South Haven, Sun Ridge, and Lake Ridge subdivisions of southwest Lubbock between Slide Road and Quaker Avenue around 15:40 CST. The hailstones damaged roofs and skylights on over a 1,000 homes in the mentioned subdivisions, and three persons sought medical treatment at local hospitals for minor injuries related to the hail. Hail stones also reportedly killed a number of birds. Well over 600 vehicles were damaged in these subdivisions and adjacent areas of the city. Damages in the mentioned subdivisions were estimated at $20 million, with hail damage across the city of Lubbock estimated to total $40 million.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A local newspaper clipping with a quote from a major roofing company estimated 40 to 50 percent of the homes in Midland needed to be re-roofed.  The average cost to replace a shingled roof is anywhere from $8-$10K.  This resulted in an estimated $160 million in roof damage.  In addition to homes being damaged, multiple vehicles also received damage from the hail.  According to local dent repair shops and car dealers across the area, an estimated 800 vehicles had to be repaired resulting in $1.2 million in damage.

The setup for the event featured a slow moving warm front that was draped from far northwest Missouri southeastward into central Missouri. This front had been reinforced by a complex of thunderstorms that had impacted northern Missouri during the overnight and early morning hours prior, allowing abundant low level moisture to become pooled along the front. Strong daytime heating along and south of the front sent temperatures into the middle and upper 80s. With strong instability and moisture in place by late afternoon, conditions were ripe for rapid thunderstorm development as an upper level disturbance moving through Kansas provided the lift necessary for thunderstorms. However, it was the strong turning and increase in winds with height (known as wind shear) that set the stage for severe storms, specifically supercells.||While these extremely photogenic storms thankfully were not damaging tornado producers, June 7th featured some of the most destructive hail ever observed across northern Missouri, with two separate storms producing softball and grapefruit size hail, leaving widespread destruction to trees, homes, and vehicles.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Grapefruit sized hail lasted 10 minutes, on the west shore of Lake Viking.

Surface temperatures on the 8th warmed into the upper 80s and 90s, with dew point readings in the 70s.  A weak cold front moved into the state during the evening of the 8th and early morning of the 9th.  There was little thunderstorm development initially as the airmass was capped.  Temperatures at the 700 mb level were +14 to +17 C.   During the early morning hours of the 9th, a short wave lifted northeast out of the southern Rockies.  This resulted in cooling of the mid levels of the atmosphere, thus destabilizing the airmass.  The cold front stall out during the morning of the 9th as a second short wave lifted northast.   Eventually, the front moved south of the state on the night of the 9th.  Overall lifted indices were in the -6 to -10 C range with CAPE values in the 3000 to 4000 J/kg range.  Downdraft CAPE was in the 800 to 1400 J/kg range with 30 to 50 kts of shear available.  CAOE available in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 300 and 700 J/kg, with a freezing level of 14,000 to 14,500 feet.  The LCL was relatively high across the area ranging from just below 1000 meters to about 1250 meters.  Plenty of moisture was available with precipitable water values between 1.75 and 2.25 inches.  Thunderstorms developed initially over Nebraska and tracked east-northeast into Iowa shortly after sunrise.  One supercell continued to track across the state and produced a swath of wind and hail damage from Sac County east to Black Hawk County.  Additional thunderstorms formed along the cold frontal boundary by mid morning and progressed into the state.  The storms remained below severe levels for several hours, but did become severe by mid afternoon.  A broken like of storms formed with two primary areas tracking east across central and southern Iowa.  These two areas featured mini bow echoes.  The predominant mode of severe weather in the afternoon was high winds.  Several of the storms produced hail, but the hail was sub-severe.  A long lived supercell Thunderstorm tracked across northern Iowa Sunday morning with the Highway 20 corridor receiving the brunt of the damage.  Reports of quarter to golf ball sized hail were common with some hail stones reported to be in excess of two inches approaching the size of a tennis ball.  The hail was wind blown as well, at speeds of 50 to 70 mph, making it extremely damaging and dangerous striping siding off houses and knocking out windows.   A measured wind speed of 68 mph was recorded at a KCCI TV SchoolNet site near Jewell in Hamilton County.   Significant hail damage was received all along the track with areas near Otho, Callender, Radcliffe, Eldora and Grundy Center hit particularly hard.  In Eldora, many homes had windows broken out and tree and power line damage left the city without power. Winds of over 100 MPH toppled a communication tower in Eldora.  A short time before the winds hit Eldora, a 102 MPH wind gust was recorded at the landfill northwest of town.  Wind driven hail of 2 to 3 inches in diameter broke all siding and windows out on the north and west walls of most homes, with hail stones reported landing inside of houses.  Damage in the town of Eldora was expected to be greater than the damage done in the town of Parkersburg by the EF5 tornado a year earlier.  A 150 square mile area of crops was affected in Hardin County.  Total losses were reported on 45,000 acres, with 60% or greater loss on another 55,000 acres.  Hail damage in the Otho to Callender areas was described as the worst seen in 20 years.  MODIS satellite pictures of the crop damage area included in this report.  Estimates of crop damage from this one supercell were over $175,000,000.  Governor Culver declared Hardin County a state disaster area within a day or two of the storm, and declared Webster County a disaster area about a week later.  Formal paperwork was turned in to make 8 Iowa counties federal disaster areas,  They were Calhoun, Grundy, Hamilton, Hardin, Ida, Sac, Webster, and Woodbury.  Following the storms, a shelter was set up for those who felt they should not stay in their homes. Luckily the evening round of storms tracked south. Campers at nearby Pine Lake State Park, gathered for an archery event, were bruised by hail.  There were 22 reports of injuries in Hardin County, 11 serious enough for people to be taken to hospital, but there are no known life threatening injuries.  A second round of severe weather rolled roughly along I-80 between 1630 and 1800 CST, producing a lot of tree and power line damage but apparently little structural damage.  As the storms moved through the metropolitan Des Moines area, winds damaged power lines and knocked out power to 12,000 homes.  One storm produced a wet microburst in Union County.  The winds took the roof and shingles off of a two story brick building near Afton.  The afternoon round of storms produced some hail, but most of the hail was not severe as mentioned above, and was pea size or smaller.  During the morning round of storms, lightning struck a building in Waverly.  The lightning struck an antenna on the building and melted screws all the way down the side of the building, starting a small fire and blowing hole in the wall.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Large hail brok windows out of a residence and caused considerable crop damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
