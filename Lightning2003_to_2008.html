A complex weather situation was in place due to the convection from the previous night.  An outflow boundary extended east to west across northern Missouri.  The synoptic frontal boundary extended from central Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The air was clear over Iowa during the day, allowing for temperatures to recover.  Dew point values also recovered quite rapidly with readings in the upper 60s to low 70s by the late afternoon hours.  Lifted indices dropped into the -5 to -10 C. range by evening with CAPE values approaching 5000 J/kg.  By the evening hours, the frontal boundary and outflow boundary had converged and were located along Interstate 80.  Explosive thunderstorm development took place during the very late afternoon and evening hours in spite of the weak shear profile.  Discrete supercells formed in a narrow line along Interstate 80 from near Des Moines on west.  The storms became tornadic quickly.  To add insult to injury, a strong thunderstorm complex formed over Nebraska and moved east along the line of convection over Iowa.  As the event took shape, all modes of severe weather occurred.  The storms developed so rapidly that there was little more than a half hour from the first hail and wind report to the first tornado touchdown.  Hail and high wind reports were too numerous to mention individually here.  Numerous reports of golf ball size hail were received.  Boone and Story Counties reported some of the largest hail with the event as baseball size hail pelted the are.  There was one report of very large hail northwest of Slater in Story County.  Hail five and one half inches in diameter punched 8 holes through a steel roof.  There was severe house siding and roof damage in the area.  There were numerous tornadoes, especially in the central Iowa Iowa.  At one point there were several supercells around the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Two of the stronger tornadoes touched down west and south of Des Moines.  Fortunately, most of the tornado tracks were over open areas and resulted in little damage.  High winds became a problem, especially after sunset, as the complex from Nebraska moved in.  The system became more of a derecho during the late night hours.  Eighty plus MPH winds pelted southwest Iowa and downed barns and several buildings in Adams and Cass Counties.  A beta bow element formed in central Iowa shortly before midnight.  The bow echo produced a measured wind gust of 106 MPH in northern Warren County.  The high winds continued to push east along Interstate 80 for the next hour or so before it started to weaken.  The other major problem was with heavy rain.  The convection from the previous night set the stage by saturating soils.  The echos trained for several hours across central Iowa with very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall rates of 4 to 5 inches per hour were common under the heavier cells.  Several locations received 2 to 5 inch rainfalls in under  two hours, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  Reports of major highways being inundated by water were common.  By the end of the night, a swath of 4 to 9 inch rainfall was evident north of Interstate 80.  Longer term river flooding became a major problem by the morning of the 23rd.  There were two lightning related injuries.  Two people were injured when they were struck by lightning out of doors in Nevada.  The lightning struck close by as they were carrying groceries into their home.  The jolt caused them to fall, resulting in laceration to the head.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This warm front began the day nearly stationary, taking 8 hours to move from Vincennes to Bloomington, then rocketing northward as the low pressure system quickly pushed off to the northeast late, dragging a cold front through the state during the overnight hours. All the necessary ingredients for a major severe weather outbreak were falling into place.  Morning upper-air observations showed very deep moisture and intense wind shear (wind change in speed and direction with respect to height) in the lower levels of the atmosphere.  Fairly clear skies during the course of the day contributed to moderately strong instability across much of Indiana.  Along and north of the warm front, winds backed to the east-southeast, further enhancing the wind shear.  This area of enhanced shear with the deep moisture and instability pooled along it would serve as the focus for the first two rounds of severe weather in the Indianapolis County Warning Area (CWA) on May 30th.The first wave of severe weather came in the early afternoon, as individual rotating thunderstorms, or supercells, formed just south of the warm front, crossing over the boundary soon after forming and moving into the area of enhanced shear.  These supercells began to show strong rotation soon after their formation, and produced several funnel reports and confirmed tornadoes near Spencer and Ellettsville.  Each of these tornadoes were rated F1 on the Fujita Scale of Tornado Intensity, a rating corresponding to the partial peeling of roofs and destruction of small outbuildings.Wave number two began in the late afternoon and continued into the early evening hours. Additional supercell development occurred further west along the warm front, in an area that had been receiving plenty of heating all day, maximizing instability in the very moist air mass. This wave of storms included a storm that produced tornadoes in Fountain and Tippecanoe counties, one of which was rated F2 near Dayton, just southeast of Lafayette, and a long-lived supercell that tracked along and just south of the I-70 corridor, producing tornadoes in Brazil, Little Point, Monrovia, just south of Plainfield, Camby, and Indianapolis.  Power flashes from the Camby tornado were visible from the front door of NWS Indianapolis.  The strongest of these tornadoes was the Indianapolis tornado, which briefly achieved F2 strength on the southeast side near Keystone Avenue between Raymond and Troy where there was significant damage to numerous homes, a nursing home and an elementary school. 26 nursing home inhabitants were treated at local hospitals for minor injuries, and the rest were relocated as the building was inhabitable. In addition to this tornado, the Monrovia tornado was rated F1.  All additional tornadoes from this particular supercell were rated F0, a rating corresponding to moderate tree damage and damage to outbuildings and signboards. There was also a lightning fatality in Veedersburg in Fountain County as a 24 year old male was struck while on a baseball field.The final wave of severe weather came in the late evening and early nighttime hours, and was mostly in the form of wind damage, although brief tornadoes did occur along the squall line that had formed near the Mississippi River and tracked eastward, accompanying the passage of the cold front, including tornadoes near Lake Monroe and Crothersville in south central Indiana, and Atlanta and Frankton in north central Indiana.  The tornado near Lake Monroe was rated F1, while all additional tornadoes were rated F0.To complicate the issue, the repeated rounds of heavy rain caused flooding problems across much of the area, with several flash flood warnings and urban/small stream flood advisories being issued during the evening and overnight hours.Fifteen total tornadoes touched down in central Indiana on May 30th, with damage estimates approaching $13,000,000 for central Indiana alone. In all, an additional eight tornadoes touched down in portions of Indiana that are served by neighboring NWS forecast offices, bringing the statewide total for the day to 23, four over the yearly average of 19.  This places the May 30th outbreak as the second largest outbreak in state history, behind the outbreak of 2 June 1990, and ahead of the "Super Outbreak" of 3-4 April 1974.  37 tornadoes touched down statewide in the 1990 outbreak, and 21 tornadoes touched down during the Super Outbreak, which was the largest outbreak of tornadoes in recorded history, with 148 tornadoes touching down across 13 states and southern Canada, killing 351 and injuring thousands.  Nationwide, several more tornadoes were reported, along with nearly 200 reports of large hail and nearly 600 reports of wind damage.  Reports occurred all along the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, stretching from central Minnesota all the way to northeast Texas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 24 year old male was hit by lightning on a baseball field and died shortly thereafter.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Intense thunderstorms fired along and ahead of a cold front working down from the northern Great Lakes and eventually developed into a large MCS by mid evening. The Tri Cities and thumb regions were especially hard hit during this event. Several microbursts actually produced 100 MPH wind gusts across northeast Huron county, causing quite a bit of damage. The outflow created from the storms across the north actually held together long enough to spread south. There were several reports of trees blown down in areas south of M-59, although the damage was minimal when compared to the destruction across the northern parts of the area. Very few reports of hail were received, however, golf ball size hail was reported in Saginaw County. This event caused one death and one injury in Wayne County. A couple was struck by lightning after seeking refuge under a tree.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A couple was struck by lightning after taking shelter from the rain under a tree at 2301 EST in Krainz Park near East Hildale and Justine on Detroit's east side. The pair was taken to Detroit Receiving Hospital, where the 44 year old woman was later pronounced dead. The 2nd person, a 46 year old male, survived but was initially in temporary serious condition at the hospital.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These storms developed well ahead of a cold front that extended from southern and eastern Oklahoma, into central Arkansas, but mainly along a differential moisture boundary that moved south across east Texas, extreme southern Arkansas, and north Louisiana. Strong surface instability, and gust fronts that developed from these storms, focused new shower and thunderstorm development, with several of these storms becoming severe. One longer lived severe thunderstorm developed over eastern Upshur County, then merged with another southward moving band of strong thunderstorms, producing widespread wind damage across eastern Upshur, much of Gregg, and northern Rusk County. The cities of Longview and Kilgore were hit hardest, with numerous trees blown down/uprooted, power lines downed, and trees falling onto homes, with at least one known injury reported. A 53-yr old man was killed on the north side of Longview when lightning struck a tree he was standing near in wake of the storm.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 53 year old man was struck and killed by lightning on Cox Lane.

The system came through as a bowling ball type event as the upper low first became negatively tilted, then closed off over Iowa.  Low pressure moved across Kansas into northern Missouri, then turned northeast across central into northeast Iowa as it intensified.  The low dropped to about 978 mb as it moved through Iowa.  The low brought a variety of weather to the state, with a blizzard over much of the west half of the state, and thunderstorms with pea to marble size hail over the east half.  As the low passed to the east cold air and high winds overspread the state.  Sustained winds of 30 to 40 MPH were widespread, with occasional gusts to between 50 to 60 MPH were common.  Visibility in rural areas dropped to zero, remaining that way for an extended period of time.  Heavy snowfall occurred over the western part of Iowa with snowfall rates approaching 4 inches per hour at times as the snow was convective in nature.  A large area of Iowa northwest of a a Creston to Mason City line received in excess of 10 inches of snow.  Some of the heavier totals include 18 inches at Estherville, 17 inches at Carroll, 16.8 inches in Estherville, 15.5. inches in Ringsted, and 14 inches in Pocahontas, Atlantic, and Goldfield.  The combination of high winds, heavy snowfall, and the preexisting snow on the ground resulted in roads drifting shut quite rapidly.  Widespread blizzard conditions resulted in numerous road closures over the northwest half of the state.  Interstate 80 was closed westbound at Iowa City to the Nebraska border, and both east and westbound at Des Moines.  Interstate 35 was close both north and southbound at Ankeny to the Minnesota border.  Hundreds of people were stranded in their cars during the height of the blizzard.  The National Guard was called out to conduct numerous SAR missions.  Reports of 5 to 10 foot snow drifts were common across western and northern Iowa, with drifts of 16 feet reported in the Carroll area.  The high winds and wet snow caused additional power outages over parts of the state as well.  An additional 30,000 people lost power during the storm.  Governor Chet Culver declared the remaining 39 counties of the state disaster areas, bringing all 99 counties under disaster declaration.  In addition, a request was made to place 44 Iowa Counties into Federal Disaster Status.  The request was granted, along with two additional counties.  A total of 46 counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration.  The blizzard was considered the worst blizzard in decades for parts of western Iowa.  In Carroll for example, the blizzard was the worst since the blizzard of 1947.  During the storm in Des Moines, thunderstorms moved across the city.  A woman was struck by lightning outside of Lovejoy Elementary School in Des Moines.  She received minor injuries and reported pain in her arm following the strike.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
