Severe thunderstorms developed along the front, producing 3/4 inch diameter hail in a few places from southern Genesee county into northern Oakland county.  The heaviest damage began as the storms reached central Oakland county.  Wind gusts to 55 knots flipped airplanes at the Oakland county airport west of Pontiac, and blew down several trees in a path from Waterford southeast across Pontiac.  The damage increased as the storm continued to the southeast across Macomb county, where over 500 home owners filed insurance claims with AAA Michigan, and at least 900 claimes were received by State Farm Insurance.  The core of strongest winds tracked from northwest to southeast across the towns of Sterling Heights, Fraser, Roseville and Saint Clair Shores.  Roofs were torn off of several buildings, and many large trees were blown down.  The roof was torn off of an elementary school in Roseville, and a parked tractor trailer was overturned at the Macomb Mall.  One women was injured when she was hit by a falling tree.  Approximately 62,000 people in Oakland and Macomb counties were left without power.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One lawmaker sustained injuries from the flying glass.  A little further east in town, at the city cemetary, 4 large pine trees were knocked down.

Millions of dollars in damage resulted from the biggest severe weather outbreak to affect the region in years.The storms began to develop early in the afternoon across north-central Wisconsin.  Hail the size of baseballs fell in Minocqua (Oneida co.), damaging nearly 200 vehicles.  As those storms moved southeast and weakened, a new supercell thunderstorm developed over Lincoln county.  This new storm produced wind damage in Tomahawk and softball size hail northeast of Merrill.  About 20 minutes later, a tornado developed in southeast Lincoln county and moved southeastward into Marathon county.  This tornado, rated F2, was on the ground for more than three miles.  It damaged several homes, vehicles and silos, and destroyed numerous barns, sheds and crops.  Twenty head of dairy cattle were killed or had to be destroyed.  As  the tornadic supercell moved southeast, it produced two other weak tornadoes.  Total damage to crops and property from five tornadoes, hail and straight-line winds in Marathon county alone topped $10 million.Another supercell thunderstorm produced a downburst swath of damage over three miles wide and 14 miles long from southeast Langlade county, through western Menominee county, into extreme north-central Shawano county.  Menominee county was especially hard hit, as tens of thousands of trees were felled in the heavily forested county.  Authorities estimated that nearly 25 million board feet of lumber was on the ground; it was hoped that much of it was going to be salvaged.  At the height of the storm, winds were estimated to be near 100 mph.  As the storm weakened and moved into north-central Shawano county, a 70 mph wind gust was measured near Morgan.  Another storm in western Shawano county produced a downburst which downed trees across the city of Wittenberg.  Part of a roof was blown off an apartment building in the downtown area, and several houses and businesses sustained damage from the fallen trees.  A Wittenberg man was injured by flying glass.  Lightning set a house on fire, destroying the second story, in the township of Germania.Another storm struck Waupaca county, producing high winds.  A power pole fell and hit a car in New London, injuring the driver.Shortly after 530 pm, a supercell thunderstorm produced numerous wind gusts over 65 mph across the Fox Valley, blowing over many trees, damaging buildings and causing a fatality.  A 36 year-old male was killed when a tree fell on his minivan in Oshkosh (Winnebago co.).  His young daughter was uninjured in the accident.  A wind gust to 82 mph was measured in Appleton (Outagamie co.), and a gust to 67 mph was recorded in Oshkosh.Thunderstorms over Waushara county produced flooding rains, a brief tornado, strong winds and hail.  Over five inches of rain fell in only three hours near Hancock, producing some basement and street flooding.  A brief tornado also touched down in an open field in Hancock.  Numerous trees and powerlines were blown down in Wautoma.A thunderstorm knocked trees and power lines down in Kiel (Calumet/Manitowoc co.), and damaged seven tents at a fair in Cleveland (Manitowoc co.).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The most impacting damage occurred in Frederick Co, where numerous trees and wires were blown down in the Winchester area.  One of those trees became an airborne missile, crashing through an automobile windshield and slightly injuring the 30-year old female driver.  In Clarke Co, several trees and large limbs were felled in the Berryville area, including one onto the historic home of George Washington's adopted daughter.  Numerous wires were reported down as well.Dozens of other trees and large limbs fell in western Loudoun co, northern Fauquier Co, and Arlington Co.  In western Loudoun Co, a large limb just missed striking a country inn; a picnic table was tossed from one yard to another.  The Northern Virginia Electric Cooperative reported 3800 customers were without power during the peak of the storm.  Some of the limbs that fell blocked roads; most notably federal route 340 near Berryville.In Arlington Co, a man and woman were struck by lightning in the Pentagon's parking lot; the man remained in serious condition that evening.  Large limbs fell onto the George Washington Parkway at Spout Run.  At least 14,000 customers were without power during the peak of the storm in the northern Virginia suburbs.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These storms produced high winds and hail.  High winds downed several trees and power lines in several areas.  The "swath" of greatest damage extended from Central Rockland County southeast across Southern Westchester County, Northern Nassau County and Northwest Suffolk County.  High winds also downed trees and power lines in Greenwood Lake and Chester (Orange County).  They resulted in accidents, causing seven people to get injured in Newburgh.  A driver and passenger were injured in Newburgh when a tree fell across Route 52 and landed on their car.	Meteorologists from the National Weather Service Upton Office confirmed that a weak F0 tornado occurred late Thursday afternoon in the Cherry Grove Community on Fire Island.  Damage was light with a few businesses, houses, and boats at the ferry terminal at Cherry Grove being affected.  The damage was limited to awnings, windows, roofs, and trees.The tornado formed in a thunderstorm complex that produced severe wind damage across Southeast NY, from Central Rockland, southeast to Northwest Suffolk Counties.  A 56 mph wind gust was measured by a Weather Access Automated Station at the Fire Island Coast Guard, which is about 10 miles west of Cherry Grove.Additionally, it was learned that a cloud-to-ground lightning strike to one of the ferries servicing the area resulted in damage to the radio/navigation system on the vessel.Funnel clouds were sighted from Bayville to Syosset in Northern Nassau County and in Huntington in Northwest Suffolk County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Two weak, short-lived tornadoes were spawned. One in Abbeville county downed trees and power lines. Another tornado, this one a little stronger, moved across a garbage truck transfer station in Chester county, lifting a trailer off the ground and turning it over. One mobile home was destroyed, injuring an occupant, and others damaged in Anderson county when straight line winds associated with a spiral rain band/squall moved through. Heavy rain collapsed part of a small strip mall in Clemson. Lightning struck a home in Union.Flash flooding from the heavy tropical rain caused most of the damage, however. In Laurens county, North Rabun Creek came out of its banks, covering a few bridges and flooding some homes. Bridges and roads were washed out or inundated by water in Chester county and one woman was injured when she drove across a washed out road. Underpinning and plumbing were washed out in a trailer park in Fort Lawn.

Two persons were injured in Mansfield Township when a tree came crashing down on the hood of their vehicle.  The other person, the son of a carnival worker, was injured by a flying limb in Hackettstown.   Numerous trees were uprooted.  Peak wind gusts averaged around 65 mph.  One thunderstorm caused wind damage in the southwestern part of the county in Harmony Township and  Phillipsburg.  The other thunderstorm caused a swath of damage in the northern half of the county in Allamuchy, Blairstown, Hackettstown, Hope, Independence, Knowlton and Mansfield Townships.Most of the structural damage to homes and vehicles were caused by fallen trees.  In Harmony Township, the damage was described as a disaster area.  Fallen trees closed three major roadways.  In Knowlton Township, the Clover Rest Home was evacuated because of downed wires.  In Hope Township, it was nearly impossible to find a piece of property that did not have wind damage.  Hardest hit were the Locust Lake Road and Mount Hermon Road areas.  One resident in that area had 17 uprooted trees on their property.  Most of the township also lost power.   The large cross on the roof of St John's Methodist Church was torn from the steeple and thrust into the church's roof.  At the Triple Brook Mobile Home Park, campers were overturned and tents were ripped.  The area was nearly evacuated.  In Phillipsburg, downed power lines started a house fire. In Hackettstown alone hundreds of trees were uprooted.  The steeple of the St. James Episcopal Church was damaged and a house on Grand Avenue suffered extensive wind damage.Throughout central and northwest New Jersey about 78,000 GPU customers lost power.  About 50,000 customers still had no power the morning of the 19th (Saturday).  The number was down to 16,000 the (Sunday) evening of the 20th (6,000  in Warren County), 1,000 the afternoon of the 21st (Monday) and the final 94 in Phillipsburg were back on line on the 22nd (Tuesday).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The front initiated many severe thunderstorms and three tornadoes in Columbia County.  In Columbia County near Copake Lake, an F1 tornado produced minor damage to two houses, scattered parts of a barn across county highway 7A  and downed many trees and wires.  In Columbia County near Canaan, two tornadoes produced extensive damage.  The F1 tornado formed just southwest of Beebe Pond, moved northeast and terminated near the intersection of state routes 295 and 22.  The tornado damaged several residences and moved a car port.  The F2  tornado initiated near the intersection of state routes 295 and 22 and moved eastward across the New York border into Berkshire County Massachusetts where it ended as an F1 tornado.  At the County Caretaker Lawn and Garden Center, four large greenhouses incurred structural damage.  On Shaker Ridge Road, a newly constructed three story home had the roof completely blown off along with the rear exterior wall.  The detached garage was blown off the foundation and destroyed.  Since this area is forested, many trees and wires were downed by the tornadoes resulting in power outages.  At the South Albany Airport near Selkirk, thunderstorm winds destroyed a Cessna 172 and a vintage1940's Luscombe 8E.  The winds also ripped a roof off a garage and downed several trees.  In Schoharie County at Charlotteville, straight line winds rolled over a mobile home with five people inside.  A  second mobile home which was unoccupied was lifted on top of the rolled over mobile home.  The five people sustained  injuries.  In Rensselaer County at Stephentown, thunderstorm winds lifted a barn and dropped it on East Road.  Many trees and power lines were also downed by the wind.  The thunderstorms also produced hail in parts of Schoharie, Washington, Albany and Columbia Counties.  A combination of damaging winds and lightning, left fifteen to twenty thousand people without power across eastern New York.  A lifeguard at the Northhampton Beach State Campsite in Northville was struck by lightning.  The individual was hospitalized and released with no serious injuries.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The second line of thunderstorms moved over the area during the evening.  For the day, these thunderstorms caused two deaths and 24 injuries.Both lines of severe thunderstorms produced high winds.  In addition, the first line produced large hail.Here are selected wind gusts from Western Suffolk County with the passage of the first line:o  60 mph at both Babylon and Farmingdale Airport.o  58 mph at Bohemia.Significant structural damage (several roofs were blown off businesses) resulted in five injuries in Deer Park.  A NWS Meteorologist investigated this damage and concluded that it was caused by a microburst.  At least 3 roofs were blown off:  the K-Lombardi Repair Shop and 2 businesses on Price Parkway.In addition to the 1 inch diameter hail observed at Babylon, 3/4-inch diameter hail occurred at Deer Park.With the passage of the second line, two male workers were hurled off a scaffold at Aviation High School in Sunnyside Queens.  Two other men that were on the scaffold were injured, as the scaffold collapsed.High winds caused two tents to collapse:  one in Queens causing 16 injuries and one in Brooklyn causing 3 injuries.Lightning struck a two-story facility at 188 Sullivan Place in Brooklyn.  It ignited a significant fire, that caused  1 death and 2 injuries.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The line reached the Connecticut Valley, affecting towns in Hampden, Hampshire, and Franklin Counties starting just before 3 PM.  A microburst occurred in Worcester later during the afternoon.  In Hampden County,  spotters reported dime size hail in Blandford and Longmeadow.  Trees were reported blown down in Granville and Tolland where about 4,000 electric customers lost power.  State police reported trees blown down in Chester.  Nickel size hail fell in West Springfield and Agawam.  In Hampshire County, dime size hail was reported in Huntington and trees and power lines were knocked down in Northampton.  One tree fell on a house.  Numerous trees were blown down in Amherst and road signs were reported down in Hadley at the intersection of Routes 9 and 47.  In Worcester County, wind damage was reported in Templeton, including downed power lines.  Also, in Worcester County, two microbursts occurred within 15 minutes of each other.  The first one struck in Holden at the Holden Reservoir and uprooted one tree and destroyed four others at 4:30 PM.  At  4:45 PM, two miles farther east, another microburst hit at Indian Lake in Worcester.  A National Weather Service investigation determined that a microburst occurred along the north shore of Indian Lake.  Peak wind speeds were estimated up to 70 mph.  There was an estimated $3,000 to $4,000 damage to boats at the lake.  On land, one boat, about 12 to 14 feet long, was blown approximately 26 feet and the roof was ripped off a storage shed.  A woman suffered a mild concussion when she was struck by a wind surfing sail.  Timely warnings by the National Weather Service allowed up to 100 people to be cleared from the lake before the storm struck.  In Middlesex County, in Pepperell, there was wind damage including trees and power lines blown down.  Dime size hail fell in Lunenburg and Groton.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Millions of dollars in damage resulted from the biggest severe weather outbreak to affect the region in years.The storms began to develop early in the afternoon across north-central Wisconsin.  Hail the size of baseballs fell in Minocqua (Oneida co.), damaging nearly 200 vehicles.  As those storms moved southeast and weakened, a new supercell thunderstorm developed over Lincoln county.  This new storm produced wind damage in Tomahawk and softball size hail northeast of Merrill.  About 20 minutes later, a tornado developed in southeast Lincoln county and moved southeastward into Marathon county.  This tornado, rated F2, was on the ground for more than three miles.  It damaged several homes, vehicles and silos, and destroyed numerous barns, sheds and crops.  Twenty head of dairy cattle were killed or had to be destroyed.  As  the tornadic supercell moved southeast, it produced two other weak tornadoes.  Total damage to crops and property from five tornadoes, hail and straight-line winds in Marathon county alone topped $10 million.Another supercell thunderstorm produced a downburst swath of damage over three miles wide and 14 miles long from southeast Langlade county, through western Menominee county, into extreme north-central Shawano county.  Menominee county was especially hard hit, as tens of thousands of trees were felled in the heavily forested county.  Authorities estimated that nearly 25 million board feet of lumber was on the ground; it was hoped that much of it was going to be salvaged.  At the height of the storm, winds were estimated to be near 100 mph.  As the storm weakened and moved into north-central Shawano county, a 70 mph wind gust was measured near Morgan.  Another storm in western Shawano county produced a downburst which downed trees across the city of Wittenberg.  Part of a roof was blown off an apartment building in the downtown area, and several houses and businesses sustained damage from the fallen trees.  A Wittenberg man was injured by flying glass.  Lightning set a house on fire, destroying the second story, in the township of Germania.Another storm struck Waupaca county, producing high winds.  A power pole fell and hit a car in New London, injuring the driver.Shortly after 530 pm, a supercell thunderstorm produced numerous wind gusts over 65 mph across the Fox Valley, blowing over many trees, damaging buildings and causing a fatality.  A 36 year-old male was killed when a tree fell on his minivan in Oshkosh (Winnebago co.).  His young daughter was uninjured in the accident.  A wind gust to 82 mph was measured in Appleton (Outagamie co.), and a gust to 67 mph was recorded in Oshkosh.Thunderstorms over Waushara county produced flooding rains, a brief tornado, strong winds and hail.  Over five inches of rain fell in only three hours near Hancock, producing some basement and street flooding.  A brief tornado also touched down in an open field in Hancock.  Numerous trees and powerlines were blown down in Wautoma.A thunderstorm knocked trees and power lines down in Kiel (Calumet/Manitowoc co.), and damaged seven tents at a fair in Cleveland (Manitowoc co.).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Millions of dollars in damage resulted from the biggest severe weather outbreak to affect the region in years.The storms began to develop early in the afternoon across north-central Wisconsin.  Hail the size of baseballs fell in Minocqua (Oneida co.), damaging nearly 200 vehicles.  As those storms moved southeast and weakened, a new supercell thunderstorm developed over Lincoln county.  This new storm produced wind damage in Tomahawk and softball size hail northeast of Merrill.  About 20 minutes later, a tornado developed in southeast Lincoln county and moved southeastward into Marathon county.  This tornado, rated F2, was on the ground for more than three miles.  It damaged several homes, vehicles and silos, and destroyed numerous barns, sheds and crops.  Twenty head of dairy cattle were killed or had to be destroyed.  As  the tornadic supercell moved southeast, it produced two other weak tornadoes.  Total damage to crops and property from five tornadoes, hail and straight-line winds in Marathon county alone topped $10 million.Another supercell thunderstorm produced a downburst swath of damage over three miles wide and 14 miles long from southeast Langlade county, through western Menominee county, into extreme north-central Shawano county.  Menominee county was especially hard hit, as tens of thousands of trees were felled in the heavily forested county.  Authorities estimated that nearly 25 million board feet of lumber was on the ground; it was hoped that much of it was going to be salvaged.  At the height of the storm, winds were estimated to be near 100 mph.  As the storm weakened and moved into north-central Shawano county, a 70 mph wind gust was measured near Morgan.  Another storm in western Shawano county produced a downburst which downed trees across the city of Wittenberg.  Part of a roof was blown off an apartment building in the downtown area, and several houses and businesses sustained damage from the fallen trees.  A Wittenberg man was injured by flying glass.  Lightning set a house on fire, destroying the second story, in the township of Germania.Another storm struck Waupaca county, producing high winds.  A power pole fell and hit a car in New London, injuring the driver.Shortly after 530 pm, a supercell thunderstorm produced numerous wind gusts over 65 mph across the Fox Valley, blowing over many trees, damaging buildings and causing a fatality.  A 36 year-old male was killed when a tree fell on his minivan in Oshkosh (Winnebago co.).  His young daughter was uninjured in the accident.  A wind gust to 82 mph was measured in Appleton (Outagamie co.), and a gust to 67 mph was recorded in Oshkosh.Thunderstorms over Waushara county produced flooding rains, a brief tornado, strong winds and hail.  Over five inches of rain fell in only three hours near Hancock, producing some basement and street flooding.  A brief tornado also touched down in an open field in Hancock.  Numerous trees and powerlines were blown down in Wautoma.A thunderstorm knocked trees and power lines down in Kiel (Calumet/Manitowoc co.), and damaged seven tents at a fair in Cleveland (Manitowoc co.).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In Flemington, a driver suffered spine and head injuries after a tree landed on its vehicle.  In Readington Township, portions of the Interstate Iron Works building collapsed.  High winds damaged the roof and several sections fell inside the plant.  Eight main roads within the township were closed because of fallen trees.  An uprooted walnut tree pulled up a tombstone from 1863.  Trees came down on two occupied vehicles, but no one was hurt.  At least nine vehicles within the township were damaged by fallen trees.  In Clinton Township, there was considerable utility pole damage on U.S. Route 22.  Three occupied vehicles were hit by fallen trees, but there were no injuries.  The hardest hit streets in Clinton included Halsted, Lehigh and West Main.Throughout central and northwest New Jersey about 78,000 (out of a possible 490,000) GPU customers lost power.  About 50,000 customers still had no power the morning of the 19th (Saturday).

The most notable damage occurred along the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay during the middle of the evening, when a microburst containing estimated winds of up to 90 mph destroyed two barns, and lifted a gas station pump canopy off its moorings, in Deale.The first event occurred in extreme northern Montgomery Co at around 4:15 PM, when a chapel at a religious summer camp was struck by lightning and burned to the ground.  Thankfully, campers were gone for the summer - normally the chapel would be filled at that hour.  About one hour later, lightning struck a 26-foot sailboat on the Chesapeake Bay just east of St Margarets, causing minor injuries to two men aboard.  The same storm produced gusty winds which caused at least two other vessels to become distressed.  One of the boats, an 18-footer, reportedly sank near Greenbury Point.Another cell moved into northern Montgomery Co at around 5:30 PM, dropping 3/4 to 7/8 inch diameter hail and knocking down small trees and large limbs in the Olney/Ashton area.  During the early evening hours, thunderstorms became a bit more organized across northern Maryland.  The line drifted south and east through the evening, producing frequent lightning, brief downpours, and several instances of damage.  In eastern Washington Co, at least four trees fell onto local roads between Sharpsburg and Hagerstown.  Soon after, numerous large limbs, some trees, and power lines were knocked down in the Whites Ferry area of Montgomery Co, as well as in portions of Frederick City.Additional damage occurred across northern Maryland between 7:15 and 8 PM.  In southern Carroll Co, a tree fell onto a house in Winfield.  At least a dozen medium-sized tree limbs fell near Eldersburg, where an observer recorded a gust of 69 mph.  In Baltimore Co, emergency management officials reported numerous trees, limbs, and power lines down, several blocking area roadways.  Two trees were blown down in neighboring Harford Co; other trees and large limbs were blown down in eastern Howard Co from Columbia to Ellicott City.Damage in Glen Burnie and the Linthicum area included at least 20 affected trees, a damaged shed and fence, and downed wires.  a man was slightly injured when a large limb fell onto his automobile in Glen Burnie.  Wind gusts at nearby BWI airport were as high as 53 mph.  The heavy rain may have contributed to a three-car pile up in Glen Burnie, in which all 15 passengers sustained minor injuries.  Excessive speed and hydroplaning were the likely culprits.In all, over 30,000 Maryland residents were without power as a result of the storms, including 28,800 in the Baltimore Gas and Electric service area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The northeast quarter of the county suffered the least damage.  Three persons were injured.  A 20-year-old man was seriously injured when he was buried by falling limbs at the Flanders Valley Golf Course in Mount Olive.  The damaging wind gusts injured a teenager by making her lose control of the vehicle she was driving and slammed it into a utility pole.  A 43-year-old woman was injured in Long Hill Township when a tree fell on her vehicle near the intersection of Mountain and Basking Ridge Roads.  One person was also injured in Flanders during the clean-up on Saturday.  Peak wind gusts were estimated at around 65 mph.  Most of the damage to homes and vehicles were caused by the fallen trees.  Several homes had trees come crashing through their roofs.  The downed trees and wires closed many roads.  The downed wires also ignited several fires.In Roxbury Township, over 100 trees were uprooted with Succasunna and Kenvil hit very hard.  Emergency personnel responded to 37 calls and there were about 30 small wire fires throughout the township.  A female driver and her passenger narrowly escaped injury after a tree fell on her vehicle.  One home in Succasunna lost its roof.  In Mount Olive Township, U.S. Route 206 was closed for 18 hours.  100 year old/50 foot high trees were uprooted throughout most of the township.  At least half of Mount Olive lost power.  According to published reports no areas within the township were "spared".  The wind was so strong it blew a 13 inch bass out of Budd Lake.  Most of the power was also out in Rockaway Township.  Downed trees closed four major roads in Mendham Township, 10 roads in Washington Township and 6 roads in Harding Township.  Emergency personnel responded to 175 calls in Long Hill Township.  The Morris County Municipal Utilities Authority issued mandatory water use restrictions to its 10,000 customers after the storms knocked out power to their wells.Throughout central and northwest New Jersey 78,000 of the 490,000 GPU customers lost power.  About 50,000 customers still had no power the morning of the 19th (Saturday).  The number was down to 16,000 the (Sunday) evening of the 20th and 1,000 the afternoon of the 21st (Monday).  The final 94 (in Warren County) were not back on line until the 22nd (Tuesday).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The second line of thunderstorms moved over the area during the evening.  For the day, these thunderstorms caused two deaths and 24 injuries.Both lines of severe thunderstorms produced high winds.  In addition, the first line produced large hail.Here are selected wind gusts from Western Suffolk County with the passage of the first line:o  60 mph at both Babylon and Farmingdale Airport.o  58 mph at Bohemia.Significant structural damage (several roofs were blown off businesses) resulted in five injuries in Deer Park.  A NWS Meteorologist investigated this damage and concluded that it was caused by a microburst.  At least 3 roofs were blown off:  the K-Lombardi Repair Shop and 2 businesses on Price Parkway.In addition to the 1 inch diameter hail observed at Babylon, 3/4-inch diameter hail occurred at Deer Park.With the passage of the second line, two male workers were hurled off a scaffold at Aviation High School in Sunnyside Queens.  Two other men that were on the scaffold were injured, as the scaffold collapsed.High winds caused two tents to collapse:  one in Queens causing 16 injuries and one in Brooklyn causing 3 injuries.Lightning struck a two-story facility at 188 Sullivan Place in Brooklyn.  It ignited a significant fire, that caused  1 death and 2 injuries.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The mobile home park is located one mile northeast of the U.S. Highway 131/Stadium Street (Business I-94) interchange.     One injury (a broken wrist) was caused when a microburst approximately 150 yards long and 50 yards wide struck the park. The first damage was noted on Stadium Street at the Burger King and Lee's Restaurant. Two light poles were downed at a Burger King restaurant. The Lee's Restaurant sign was broken with large fragments of 1 to 2 feet driven into the front siding of the restaurant. Some shingles and siding were also blown off.     To the northeast, about a dozen mobile homes were pushed off foundations or received major roof damage. Two homes were completely destroyed, one of which was tied down. In the tied down mobile home, the wind ripped off the upper portions of the home, leaving only debris and the flooring. Five people were in the home at the time of the incident, one of whom was a teenage male injured with a broken wrist. The second destroyed trailer was not tied down and the back half of the trailer was broken and twisted onto its side. Debris was blown over 1/4 mile away, where a 2X4 was embedded at a downward angle into the side of a home.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Reports of large hail, flash flooding, damaging severe winds, and four tornadoes were received.  The first tornado, and the only tornado that caused damage, moved from west of Wakita to south of Wakita in Grant County. Because the damage was limited to power poles and trees, the tornado was rated as F0. The second and third tornadoes, both brief and rated F0, were reported near Deer Creek (also in Grant County) by the county sheriff's office.  The fourth and final tornado was observed west of Blackwell in Kay County by a county spotter.  Once again, no damage resulted and the tornado was rated F0.Severe straight-line winds officially measured at up to 81 mph (near Weatherford in Custer County) caused widespread and extensive damage in portions of western Oklahoma.  Beckham and Custer Counties were particularly hard-hit with major damage in Erick, Sayre, Elk City, Arapaho, Weatherford, Binger, and Clinton. Other wind damage also occurred in Wakita and near Medford in Grant County, in Canute and Cordell in Washita County, and in Oklahoma City in Oklahoma County.The largest hail was reported southwest of Renfrow in Grant County, where hail as large as golf balls fell. Flash flooding also occurred as storms moved repeatedly across parts of north-central Oklahoma producing very heavy rain.  Reports of flash flooding were received from Grant County in and around Medford, most of southern Kay County, and Noble County near Red Rock and Perry.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Severe thunderstorm winds estimated at up to 90 mph caused widespread damage and one injury in Binger.

It produced high winds that caused scattered damage in several locations.  The heaviest damage occurred on Staten Island and in Jersey City, NJ.A survey was conducted on Staten Island later Tuesday afternoon.  It was determined that damage was caused by straight line winds.  A roof was blown off a two family house with damage occurring to several trees and a satellite dish.  Eyewitnesses stated that this damage occurred before the rain arrived from the thunderstorm.  A few eyewitnesses reported seeing funnel clouds.  It was determined that the damage was caused by a strong gust front about 10 miles in advance of the line of thunderstorms.  The funnel clouds reported were actually small vortices called "gustnadoes."  These vortices sometimes accompany strong gust fronts.Examples of damage include:For Staten Island:  The roof of a car dealership at 1590 Hyland Blvd. partially collapsed and caused damage to some vehicles in the back lot.For the Bronx:  A tree fell onto a house and utility cables at 5932 and 5934 Liebig Street.  The roof, windows, gutters, and sidewalks of both homes were damaged.For Manhattan:  The front support wall of a structure located at 327 West 112th Street collapsed.Two men were struck by lightning while on a roof in Yonkers (Westchester County).In other areas, thunderstorms produced high winds that downed trees and power lines.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The winds knocked down numerous trees and powerlines leaving the entire town without power.  The high winds were also blamed for blowing down a wall on an equipment building under construction along with the new Texas Department of transportation building on FM 1845.  The wall was 250 feet long and built with concrete blocks.  The winds sent trees up to 20 feet in diameter crashing into houses and carports which collapsed onto cars.  A 300 foot tower at Farmers Academy that serves Mt. Pleasant's cable TV system was blown over.  Ninety-five (95) percent of all the trees and tall structures above 30 feet in height fell to the southeast.  Minor damage occurred to a supermarket in town leaving the people trapped inside after the power went out.  At least 5 county roads were closed, two trailer homes were damaged significantly and one woman was injured when she was struck by a shopping chart at a grocery store.  In the city alone, at least 70 structures were damaged to some extent.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

No hail was reported, lightning was present and the rain was not heavy.  Wind damage was reported county wide with the more severe damage occurring in two separate tracks contained within ten miles either side of Interstate 16 west to east across the county.        The northernmost track of damage was to trees and buildings from Dudley eastward to approximately 3 miles east southeast of East Dublin.  This damage track ended near a helicopter hangar on Georgia Highway 29 south.  The hangar and helicopter inside were damaged.  A farm house, barn and out buildings a short distance away were also damaged.  Two large Pecan trees were pushed over in the same general area, and the tops of several trees were snapped off.        At approximately 1145 pm EDT, a mobile home located almost 2 miles east of Dexter was torn from its tie downs and blown off its blocks.  It rolled over onto two automobiles, which sustained heavy damages, and moved 30 to 40 feet away.  An eighteen month old girl sustained injuries, but was released from the hospital the next day.  This damage track continued eastward to Georgia Highway 199 south, about 9 miles southeast of East Dublin.  Here one mobile home was blown loose from its tie downs, tipped over on its side and was destroyed.  A nearby modular home was damaged when a large tree limb was blown onto it.  There were minor injuries at this location.  A woman was treated for a leg injury.  Additional damage was reported just off Georgia Highway 199.  A house was damaged and power lines snapped.  Tree limbs were also blocking the road.Upon inspection by a National Weather Service employee all damage was classified as straightline winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first tornado moved through mostly open country, flattening a few out buildings along it's 3.5 mile path.  The second formed as the first one dissipated, and continued moving east through Apple Valley, south of Waalew Road.  Damage was sporadic as this twister was rather narrow and did not make contact with the ground continuously.  Several power poles were blown down, small structures destroyed, and the roof was ripped off of a garage.  Arcing power lines set several blazes which were quickly extinguished by fire fighters.  A microburst followed, which ripped a 55 foot awning from a mobile home and blew it against a car, pinning, and slightly injuring a young girl.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The microburst, which had a width of about 1/3 mile, snapped hundreds of mainly soft  wood trees and large limbs.  However, some of the trees fell onto homes and vehicles, causing substantial damage.  In Potomac, a vehicle was crushed by a falling oak tree.  The driver, waiting out the storm along the side of a road, was killed instantly.  Numerous large limbs and dozens of small trees were snapped and/or uprooted in Potomac.Farther east, at least 50 trees and limbs were snapped, most of them evergreens, at the Bethesda Country Club.  Scattered light damage continued through North Chevy Chase, then damage increased again in the Woodside section of Silver Spring.   Unfortunately, at least four homes sustained substantial damage from fallen trees in Silver Spring.  The heaviest damage occurred at the intersection of Highland and Second Avenue, where three oak trees and limbs combined to cause major damage to one home whose second story was smashed to the ground.  The next-door neighbor's home had a snapped oak crash into its garage.  Damage to the other two homes was not quite as severe.  At the intersection of Spring Street and Second Ave., an uprooted locust tree smashed into the side wall, chimney, and roof.  Another home, located at the intersection of Georgia Ave. and Noyes Drive, suffered minor roof damage from a fallen tree.  An adjacent shed was crushed by a snapped large silver maple tree.The damage lightened up as the storm moved into the Takoma Park neighborhoods just east of Silver Spring.  In all, the combination of wind and lightning cut power to 37,500 customers in the Potomac Electric Power Co service area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A 53 year-old-male from Denville died of a heart attack after being hospitalized for injuries sustained from being hit by a four foot wide tree limb while retrieving the mail.  Morris County was the second hardest hit county in northwest New Jersey this afternoon.  There were so many downed wires along New Jersey State Route 10  that it looked like spaghetti to observers.  Trees fell across and blocked the southbound lanes of Interstate 287.  Mountain Lakes Borough had 36 reports of downed trees.  In Montville Township, a 100-year-old tree punched a hole in the roof of one home.  In Boonton Township one house was so badly damaged by fallen trees that authorities feared it might have to be condemned.  Numerous downed trees and wires were also reported in Chatham, Denville, Montville and Rockaway.  This squall line caused numerous power outages throughout the northern half of New Jersey as falling trees took down electrical wires.  About 97,000 GPU customers lost power that day and 16,000 customers in Sussex and Morris Counties still did not have power restored on the morning of the 18th.

A limited state of emergency was declared.  New Jersey State Route 23 was closed as were five other major roadways within the borough.  Several trees fell on and damaged homes.  Siding was ripped from a few homes and a couple of decks and railings were ripped away from other homes.  Part of Hardin Lumber's roof was blown away.  In addition to the wind damage, the frequent lightning ignited two houses on fire.  Sussex Borough was also hard hit and also declared a state of emergency.  Six major roads were closed because of fallen trees, some through the 17th.  A couple of planes at Sussex County Airport were flipped over.  Pieces of these planes were found in the woods.  Trees as high as 150 feet were uprooted.  In Sparta Township, two major roads were also closed (including County Road 517).  Other locations that reported wind damage in the county included Fredon Township,  Hopatcong,  Lafayette Township, Vernon and Wantage.   In Vernon, the damaging winds wreaked havoc at the Vernon Day celebration and scattered debris all over Vernon Crossings Fields.

The showers continuously developed off the coast, and  moved inland over central portions of Orange County, starting before daybreak on the sixth, and lasting until the early morning hours on the seventh.  Rainfall generally ranged from 4 to 8 inches  across the area, resulting in widespread flooding.  One observer in Mission Viejo reported 10 inches of rain from this event.   The hardest hit area was the coastal plain southwest of the Santa Ana Mountains.  It was the heaviest rain recorded in at least 70 years.  Collapsing hillsides, and raging water, triggered flooding that forced scores of people to flee their homes, while others climbed atop stalled automobiles to escape the rising waters.   A Local State of Emergency was declared, as mud and debris flows damaged hundreds of homes and businesses, and halted transportation.  Storm debris littered the coastline.  Some areas, like the Rhine Channel in Newport Bay, were clogged to the point where they resembled a landfill.  Total damage estimates for the county included $5.6 million to private homes and businesses, and over $12 million to public facilities, and for debris clean-up.  Some heavy rain did spill over the Santa Ana Mountains, resulting in flooding in the community of El Cerrito, in western Riverside County.  Over 4 inches of rain caused moderate to heavy damage to 8 homes and and minor damage to 10 others.  Farther north in the Victor Valley of San Bernardino County, heavy rains caused local flooding in many communities.  Heavy downpours in Adelanto shortly after midnight, flooded an apartment complex, forcing residents to evacuate, and sent a river of mud and water a foot deep running down some streets.  During the evening of the sixth, a pair of teenage lobster fisherman were caught in a storm a mile west of the beach at North Island Naval Air Station.  Swells more than 6 feet high capsized their 18-foot skiff.  They were rescued several hours later with cuts and bruises.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This intense convection developed well ahead of a strong cold front.  The storms resulted in one fatality and three injuries.  An elderly man was instantly killed at Ellenville in Ulster County, when a large tree limb fell on him.  Two injuries occurred in Fulton County and one injury in Montgomery County.  The injuries were the result of fallen tree limbs and wires.  Across the region the damaging winds knocked out power to approximately 40,000 customers, broke several power poles and damaged dozens of homes due to fallen trees or large branches.  Damage was most widespread in Montgomery, Fulton, Saratoga, Warren and Washington Counties.  State Highway 9N south of Bolton Landing in Warren County and route 4 in the Whitehall area in northern Washington County, were closed through the evening hours due to tree debris.  At North Winfield in southern Herkimer County, a silo collapsed in the damaging winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> .5K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Three tornadoes were also sighted. Storms first developed in Kay County during the late morning where a semi-truck was blown over 1.5 miles southwest of Blackwell near the intersection of Highway 11 and Interstate 35. Severe thunderstorms then redeveloped over Major and Blaine Counties a few hours later. As these storms moved east into Garfield County, a tornado was spotted 3 miles south of Waukomis moving east. This tornado, rated an F1, knocked down or snapped 40 to 50 power poles, damaged several outbuildings, and destroyed numerous trees. One large diesel storage tank was picked up and desposited one-half mile away. A pickup truck containing 2 occupants was also picked up a short distance from the road and dropped on the side of the road near a creek. Both occupants were uninjured. A semi-trailer was also blown off the highway. As the tornado dissipated, severe thunderstorm winds blew down large tree limbs in Bison, and lightning from the same complex of thunderstorms struck a house in Enid, causing a short in the wiring, which then started a small house fire. Large tree limbs were also downed in Seiling in Dewey County, while a rain gutter from a house was ripped off by the winds 12 miles east of Hennessey in Kingfisher County breaking several flower pots. Large tree limbs were also downed in the same location.As the thunderstorms moved into Logan County, Oklahoma Mesonet measured wind gusts of 59 mph and 66 mph at 1620 CST and 1630 CST respectively 3 miles southeast of Marshall. A weak, F0 tornado was then spotted 9 miles north of Crescent, just west of State Highway 74. The tornado uprooted several trees while crossing the highway, then quickly dissipated. Another weak tornado, an F0, was spotted on the Blaine/Dewey County border 2 miles west of Canton, knocking down trees and power poles. The same thunderstorm was responsible for a lightning strike at the Old Christian Church in Eagle City in Blaine County causing a fire that destroyed the church. As these storms moved east, thunderstorm winds damaged a fence, silo, and several trees in Logan County 3 miles southwest of Langston. Several power poles were blown down 1 mile north of Loyal in Kingfisher County, while in the city of Loyal 13 power poles were snapped, and large tree limbs were blown down. Widespread wind damage occurred in the city of Kingfisher consisting of downed trees and power lines over a 12 square block area on the northwest side of the city. The garage of a house also shifted causing roof damage. Oklahoma Mesonet measured wind gusts of 63 mph and 80 mph at 1900 CST and 1905 CST respectively 4 miles southwest of Guthrie in Logan County. Straight-line winds then produced a large swath of damage to mobile homes, house roofs, trees, power poles and power lines in a 4 by 6 mile area across southern Logan County bounded by Western Ave to the west, Interstate 35 to the east, Forest Hills Road to the north, and Waterloo Road to the south. The worst damage occurred in a 1/2 by 1 1/2 mile area near Oak Cliff. Two-hundred fifty residents were damaged. Of these, 10 homes and business building were destroyed, while 41 structures suffered major damage. One hundred sixty-one single family homes, 43 mobile homes, 7 businesses, and 1 apartment complex suffered minor structural damage. Total damage estimates were near 3.5 million dollars. Five persons were injured, consisting mostly of broken fingers and cuts. No one was seriously injured. Lightning also struck an oil tank at Pine and Industrial in Guthrie, starting a fire that was quickly extinguised.Unusually strong straight-line winds also left a swath of damage roughly 8 miles long and 2 miles wide from just east of Jones in eastern Oklahoma County, east-southeast into extreme western Lincoln County 3 miles northeast of Harrah. A two year-old boy was killed, and ten persons were injured, 8 of which were transported to local hospitals. Damage was estimated at about 2 million dollars. Damage was intermittent from east of Jones to north of Horseshoe Lake and was limited mainly to fallen tree limbs. A more persistent area of wind damage about 1.5 miles wide was found from near Luther Road and Wilshire southeast to near the county line and Northeast 50th. Widespread tree damage occurred in this area along with structural damage to several homes. By far the most concentrated area of damage was along a half-mile wide swath from Harrah Road and 63rd extending east-southeast. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed in this area, one of which disintegrated with the frame left wrapped around a tree. All of the destroyed mobile homes were perpendicular to the wind or nearly so and thus were hit broadside by the full force of the wind. The level of damage in this swath is estimated at strong F1 suggesting that maximum winds probably were between 100 and 110 mph.Damage in Lincoln County consisted of downed power lines, uprooted trees, and damaged outbuildings in a half-mile wide by one-mile long swath just north of Highway 62. One barn also disintegrated as it was picked up by the wind and carried nearly one-quarter of a mile. In total, 75 homes were damaged; 11 suffered major damage, and six (All mobile homes) were destroyed. Three mobile homes were found to be totally disintegrated and one other that was rolled from its foundation. Several eyewitness reports indicated that at least some of these mobile homes were airborne while or just before they were destroyed. The fatality, and most of the injuries, were residents who were in the destroyed mobile homes when the winds struck. The last report of damage in Lincoln County occurred in Chandler, where lightning struck numerous transformers and power poles, knocking out power to all of Chandler for 5 hours.Severe thunderstorm winds also downed trees, wires, and numerous power poles all across the city of Edmond in Oklahoma County. Seven thousand residents were left without power for several hours. One tree fell on a car, and the canopy was blown off at Juffy Lube on 2nd Street, east of Bryant. Farther south and east, a tree was blown down near the Mazzio's Pizza on State Highway in Cushing in Payne County; highway signs and numerous trees were downed near Highway 44 in Cleveland County 4 miles west of Moore, and trees and power lines were blown down in Norman, also in Cleveland County. Lightning struck an oil tank battery in Slaughterville in Cleveland County, causing a fire that burned for about 1 hour before being extinguished. A mobile home was blown off its foundation and destroyed in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County. Five persons were inside the home including 3 children who were injured from minor cuts and bruises. The roof was also blown off of a boathouse at Shawnee Lake, also in Pottawatomie County. Numerous Numerous power lines were downed 8 miles east of Pauls Valley in Garvin County knocking out power to 500 residents, while a house sustained significant roof damage from strong winds. Rain poured into the house causing an estimated $20,000 in damage. Power lines and large tree limbs were downed in Wewoka in Seminole County and Holdenville in Hughes County. Lastly, Lightning struck a tree in Sulphur in Murray County, killing 3 cows and an angus bull standing under it.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 35K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The result was organized severe thunderstorm activity in the form of several bow echoes and squall lines.       A line of severe thunderstorms first entered the northern Finger Lakes region shortly before 130 pm EDT.  A fatality occurred in Syracuse as this line of storms passed through.  A man was struck by a large tree limb while out walking.  Many large trees and power lines littered streets in northern and eastern portions of the Syracuse metropolitan area in the wake of the thunderstorms.  This same line of storms also grew back to the west and southwest and produced large hail to one inch in diameter across Cayuga and Seneca counties.  Later that afternoon, the line of severe thunderstorms maintained its intensity and interacted with smaller line echo wave pattern features to produce a solid axis of damaging thunderstorms across New York's southern tier and the Catskills.  An area from northern Broome county to southern Chenango county and into Otsego county likely sustained the most damage.  Wind gusts estimated at close to 90 mph toppled trees and power lines in their path.  Many roads were closed for a time in the Plymouth and Oxford areas of Chenango county due to fallen trees.       By 530 pm EDT, the severe thunderstorms had moved either into the eastern Catskills or northeastern Pennsylvania.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A line of thunderstorms became severe as it crossed northern sections of the county close to 1:30 pm EDT.

The line of storms quickly moved across Orleans, Monroe, Wayne, Ontario, and northern Cayuga counties. Across the area the damage path was nearly one hundred miles long and five to ten miles wide. Winds were estimated between 80 and 100 mph throughout the two hour event. Along the entire path, damage and debris all laid in an easterly direction consistent with the damage from straight-line winds. Most of the damage consisted of downed trees and limbs. The falling trees and limbs in turn downed power and telephone lines and resulted in damage to buildings and automobiles. Power outages, some lasting nearly a week, were widespread across parts of Orleans, Monroe and Wayne counties. Hundreds of thousands of customers were without power. The strong winds themselves also resulted in structural damage to homes, barns and buildings along the path including some in Lydonville, Albion, Holley, Brockport, Bushnells Basin, Macedon and Clyde. Several aircraft were damaged at the Rochester Airport where wind gusts were measured at 89 mph. States of Emergency were declared throughout Monroe and Wayne counties and sections of Orleans county. Monroe, Wayne and Cayuga counties were declared federal disaster areas. The strong winds severely damaged apple crops and trees from Niagara across Orleans and Monroe through Wayne counties.

The strongest tornado, an F3, occurred near Lamont in Grant County. There were also reports of hail up to 3.5 inches in diameter, straight line wind damage, and flooding. The first tornado, an F0, touched down in an open field 1 mile south of Amorita in Alfalfa County at 1745 CST lasting for less than one minute with no reports of damage. The second tornado, also an F0, was reported 5 minutes later by media chasers to have touched down in an open field 3 miles east northeast of Amorita. Touchdown was very brief with no damage reported. The third tornado was also observed by media chasers, this time in northeast Alfalfa County 8 miles east of Amorita. The tornado, an F1, damaged one house and knocked down power lines as it moved southeast and weakened while crossing into western Grant County for a total damage path lengh of 5 miles. There were no reports of damage with this segment of the tornado in Grant County and thus was rated an F0. An unusual aspect of this tornado was that it was reported to be rotating anticyclonically. The fourth and fifth tornadoes were also rated F0, the fourth reported by media chasers to have touched down in an open field 4 west northwest of Wakita with no damage, and the fifth observed by Wakita Fire Department to be on the ground for 2.5 miles from 2 miles southwest of Wakita to 2 miles south of Wakita. No damage was reported. An off-duty National Weather Service meteorologist observed the sixth tornado, an F0, in an open field 9 miles west of Medford. The seventh tornado, also an F0, produced no damage as it rotated anticyclonically 3 miles southeast of Wakita. The eighth and ninth tornadoes, both F0, occurred simultaneously 6 miles west of Medford. The eighth tornado touched down just north of Highway 11 while the ninth tornado touched down just south of Highway 11. One house and a business were damaged by the tenth tornado which occurred in Grant County from 2 miles southwest of Medford to 2 miles south of Medford.  The eleventh tornado, an F0, was observed by an off duty National Weather Service meteorologist to be knocking down trees and power lines in a 5 mile long damage path in southern Grant County. The twelvth tornado, an F1, snapped trees in half and damaged a private airstrip 4 miles east northeast of Pond Creek while the thirteenth tornado, also an F1, damaged several homes and knocked down trees and power lines 1 mile north of Salt Fork. The fourteenth tornado, an F0, was reported by spotters to have touched down briefly in an open field causing no damage.                          The most destructive tornado occurred near the city of Lamont where damage estimates reached 2 million dollars.  National Weather Service meteorologists conducted a survey of the area and found a damage path 5 1/4 miles long and 3/4 of a mile wide with F3 damage occurring 2 miles west of Lamont where a well-built brick home had all of its exterior walls destroyed. In addition, 6 single-family homes were destroyed 1.5 miles south of Lamont, while in the city of Lamont 3 single-family dwellings sustained major damage. Nine single-family homes sufferred minor damage. Nearly a dozen vehicles were destroyed, including automobiles, pickup trucks, farm trucks, and farm tractors. Several barns were destroyed including one barn where 30 sheep were also killed. More than 70 utility poles were ripped down in a 3 mile stretch. The Lamont tornado, as it is referred, was unusual in its direction of movement. Several eye witnesses reported a southeast to northwest movement. WSR-88D data also showed the mesocyclone associated with the tornado moving from south to north in a looping manner when the tornado was reported. The last tornado, the sixteenth of this episode, touched down briefly in an open field 5 miles northwest of Tonkawa at 2130 CST. Tonkawa Emergency Management reported no damage. Thus, this tornado was rated an F0.    In addition to these tornadoes, a large macroburst containing damaging straight-line winds occurred from 13 miles west of Medford (Grant County) to 4 miles west northwest of Pond Creek. Satellite dishes owned by Classic Cable Company, which were rated at 110 mph, were flattened by the winds. Straight-line wind damage was also reported in Alva where one man sustained minor injuries when he was blown into the bed of a pickup truck. Also in Alva at least 3 mobile homes suffered major damage; several carports were destroyed; awning and minor roof damage occurred to many homes; and trees and power lines were blown down. One indirect fatality occurred in Alva when a man slipped and suffered a heart attack while seeking shelter in a storm cellar. Other reports of straight-line wind damage include major roof damage to an old schoolhouse gymnasium in the city of Jefferson in Grant County. Two large cedar trees were also uprooted in Jefferson. A tree limb was blown through a picture window 14 miles north northeast of Camp Houston in Woods County. Windows were also blown out of a shed, and numerous trees were downed. Four to six inch tree limbs were blown down 9 miles west of Cherokee in Alfalfa County.  In Thomas in Custer County one utility pole was snapped and large limbs were blown down. Power lines were knocked down in Edmond in Oklahoma County. Severe winds also damaged the roof of the Fred Humphrey Pavillion in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County. The largest hail reported measured 3.5 inches in diameter and occurred in Medford in Grant County. Three reported events of at least tennis ball size hail occurred in Goltry (Alfalfa County) in less than 2 hours: tennis ball size hail at 2140 CST and 2230 CST, and baseball size hail at 2305 CST. Between 30 and 100 percent of the wheat crop was destroyed due to large hail from about 2 miles west of Jet to near Goltry. Another area south of Cherokee, near the junction of US 64 and SH 8 also sustained major wheat crop damage. In addition numerous vehicles had their windows broken. Tennis ball size hail also damaged the wheat crop and numerous vehicles in Okarche in Canadian County while in Watonga in Blaine County golf ball size hail damaged RV vehicles and street lights. Quarter size hail damaged several vehicles 6 miles north of Piedmont in Canadian County. Lightning struck a house in Piedmont causing a house to catch on fire. The last of the severe thunderstorms moved through northern Oklahoma during the early morning of May 25th, resulting in flooding near Cherokee and the National Wildlife Refuge in Alfalfa County, where 5.5 inches of rain fell. Several streets and the city park were also flooded in Blackwell in Kay County during the evening of May 24th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 55K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Three tornadoes were also sighted. Storms first developed in Kay County during the late morning where a semi-truck was blown over 1.5 miles southwest of Blackwell near the intersection of Highway 11 and Interstate 35. Severe thunderstorms then redeveloped over Major and Blaine Counties a few hours later. As these storms moved east into Garfield County, a tornado was spotted 3 miles south of Waukomis moving east. This tornado, rated an F1, knocked down or snapped 40 to 50 power poles, damaged several outbuildings, and destroyed numerous trees. One large diesel storage tank was picked up and desposited one-half mile away. A pickup truck containing 2 occupants was also picked up a short distance from the road and dropped on the side of the road near a creek. Both occupants were uninjured. A semi-trailer was also blown off the highway. As the tornado dissipated, severe thunderstorm winds blew down large tree limbs in Bison, and lightning from the same complex of thunderstorms struck a house in Enid, causing a short in the wiring, which then started a small house fire. Large tree limbs were also downed in Seiling in Dewey County, while a rain gutter from a house was ripped off by the winds 12 miles east of Hennessey in Kingfisher County breaking several flower pots. Large tree limbs were also downed in the same location.As the thunderstorms moved into Logan County, Oklahoma Mesonet measured wind gusts of 59 mph and 66 mph at 1620 CST and 1630 CST respectively 3 miles southeast of Marshall. A weak, F0 tornado was then spotted 9 miles north of Crescent, just west of State Highway 74. The tornado uprooted several trees while crossing the highway, then quickly dissipated. Another weak tornado, an F0, was spotted on the Blaine/Dewey County border 2 miles west of Canton, knocking down trees and power poles. The same thunderstorm was responsible for a lightning strike at the Old Christian Church in Eagle City in Blaine County causing a fire that destroyed the church. As these storms moved east, thunderstorm winds damaged a fence, silo, and several trees in Logan County 3 miles southwest of Langston. Several power poles were blown down 1 mile north of Loyal in Kingfisher County, while in the city of Loyal 13 power poles were snapped, and large tree limbs were blown down. Widespread wind damage occurred in the city of Kingfisher consisting of downed trees and power lines over a 12 square block area on the northwest side of the city. The garage of a house also shifted causing roof damage. Oklahoma Mesonet measured wind gusts of 63 mph and 80 mph at 1900 CST and 1905 CST respectively 4 miles southwest of Guthrie in Logan County. Straight-line winds then produced a large swath of damage to mobile homes, house roofs, trees, power poles and power lines in a 4 by 6 mile area across southern Logan County bounded by Western Ave to the west, Interstate 35 to the east, Forest Hills Road to the north, and Waterloo Road to the south. The worst damage occurred in a 1/2 by 1 1/2 mile area near Oak Cliff. Two-hundred fifty residents were damaged. Of these, 10 homes and business building were destroyed, while 41 structures suffered major damage. One hundred sixty-one single family homes, 43 mobile homes, 7 businesses, and 1 apartment complex suffered minor structural damage. Total damage estimates were near 3.5 million dollars. Five persons were injured, consisting mostly of broken fingers and cuts. No one was seriously injured. Lightning also struck an oil tank at Pine and Industrial in Guthrie, starting a fire that was quickly extinguised.Unusually strong straight-line winds also left a swath of damage roughly 8 miles long and 2 miles wide from just east of Jones in eastern Oklahoma County, east-southeast into extreme western Lincoln County 3 miles northeast of Harrah. A two year-old boy was killed, and ten persons were injured, 8 of which were transported to local hospitals. Damage was estimated at about 2 million dollars. Damage was intermittent from east of Jones to north of Horseshoe Lake and was limited mainly to fallen tree limbs. A more persistent area of wind damage about 1.5 miles wide was found from near Luther Road and Wilshire southeast to near the county line and Northeast 50th. Widespread tree damage occurred in this area along with structural damage to several homes. By far the most concentrated area of damage was along a half-mile wide swath from Harrah Road and 63rd extending east-southeast. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed in this area, one of which disintegrated with the frame left wrapped around a tree. All of the destroyed mobile homes were perpendicular to the wind or nearly so and thus were hit broadside by the full force of the wind. The level of damage in this swath is estimated at strong F1 suggesting that maximum winds probably were between 100 and 110 mph.Damage in Lincoln County consisted of downed power lines, uprooted trees, and damaged outbuildings in a half-mile wide by one-mile long swath just north of Highway 62. One barn also disintegrated as it was picked up by the wind and carried nearly one-quarter of a mile. In total, 75 homes were damaged; 11 suffered major damage, and six (All mobile homes) were destroyed. Three mobile homes were found to be totally disintegrated and one other that was rolled from its foundation. Several eyewitness reports indicated that at least some of these mobile homes were airborne while or just before they were destroyed. The fatality, and most of the injuries, were residents who were in the destroyed mobile homes when the winds struck. The last report of damage in Lincoln County occurred in Chandler, where lightning struck numerous transformers and power poles, knocking out power to all of Chandler for 5 hours.Severe thunderstorm winds also downed trees, wires, and numerous power poles all across the city of Edmond in Oklahoma County. Seven thousand residents were left without power for several hours. One tree fell on a car, and the canopy was blown off at Juffy Lube on 2nd Street, east of Bryant. Farther south and east, a tree was blown down near the Mazzio's Pizza on State Highway in Cushing in Payne County; highway signs and numerous trees were downed near Highway 44 in Cleveland County 4 miles west of Moore, and trees and power lines were blown down in Norman, also in Cleveland County. Lightning struck an oil tank battery in Slaughterville in Cleveland County, causing a fire that burned for about 1 hour before being extinguished. A mobile home was blown off its foundation and destroyed in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County. Five persons were inside the home including 3 children who were injured from minor cuts and bruises. The roof was also blown off of a boathouse at Shawnee Lake, also in Pottawatomie County. Numerous Numerous power lines were downed 8 miles east of Pauls Valley in Garvin County knocking out power to 500 residents, while a house sustained significant roof damage from strong winds. Rain poured into the house causing an estimated $20,000 in damage. Power lines and large tree limbs were downed in Wewoka in Seminole County and Holdenville in Hughes County. Lastly, Lightning struck a tree in Sulphur in Murray County, killing 3 cows and an angus bull standing under it.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Also some homes were damaged in the Quail Run section of Fountain Inn and from Taylors over towards Greer. Outbuildings were damaged just northeast of the Greenville-Spartanburg Airport. A barn roof was blown off northwest of Greer and a few members of a soccer team sustained minor injuries.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The winds tore a large section of the roof off a restaurant and a boat storage facility, damaged 50 boats, 20 severely, damaged the roof of 5 docks and destroyed a barn.  The wind also turned 6 camper trailers onto their side.  Two people in one of the trailers were injured.  A total of 80 camper trailers plus several smaller vehicles received dents and broken windows from debris and golf ball size hail driven by the strong winds.  Numerous trees, large limbs, and several power lines were also brought to the ground.  A damage survey by National Weather Service meteorologists confirmed the occurrence of a brief weak tornado but it did not appear to be the source of much damage.  One mile east of the marina winds tore apart a barn and tossed part of it into a nearby house, blowing apart the house's chimney and shattering several windows.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 700K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Once again, damage was highlighted by downed trees, large hail, and several cases of flash flooding.  Much of the notable tree damage occurred over and east of the piedmont; flash flooding was seen over and west of the piedmont.The episode was dominated by a single supercell which developed over the west central piedmont near the Blue Ridge and propagated east through Fauquier, Prince William, Fairfax, and Arlington Cos, as well as the independent city of Alexandria.  Earlier cells caused scattered severe weather generally northwest of these areas.The first event of consequence occurred in Woodstock (Shenandoah Co), where a localized storm dumped at least 2 inches of rain in 2 hours - on top of saturated soil - producing flash flooding in portions of town.  Poor drainage and low-lying areas were hard hit, in some instances worse than the flooding in 1996 (associated with tropical storm Fran).  A two-block area was evacuated.  Included in this area was a barbecue catering company, which had some equipment washed out of the store.  A small sport utility vehicle was washed up against a low-water bridge, with water cascading over the vehicle's roof.  Several side streets were flooded, not only in Woodstock but in nearby Toms Brook as well.As the storms tracked east, there were several reports of hail ranging from 0.75" to 1" in diameter. Additional flash flooding occurred in Warren Co, where a minor mud slide temporarily closed a portion of Browntown Road.  Low-lying flooding closed the intersection of River and Harrell Road.  Around this time, one thunderstorm cell became dominant as it crossed into Fauquier Co.  Soon after, the storm exhibited a bow-echo feature, and accounts of damaging winds increased accordingly.Large hail, ranging from 0.75" to 2" in diameter, fell across portions of Prince William and Fairfax Cos.  Wind gusts knocked trees and large limbs down in Centreville.  Heavier damage occurred as the bow-echo strengthened, in southern Fairfax Co and Alexandria.  In Springfield and Mt Vernon, trees fell on two cars; one motorist was injured (in Springfield) but the other(s) escaped unharmed.  Farther east, at least a dozen trees were felled in Alexandria; large limbs fell on power lines in the south portion of Arlington.  Several more large limbs and/or trees fell alongside or onto the Capital Beltway.  A bit farther south, numerous trees fell along federal highway 1 (west of Wide Water) in extreme northern Stafford Co.A final event occurred in eastern Nelson Co, where several trees fell, including one onto a porch and another onto the roof of the same residence, causing substantial structural damage to the home.In all, 31,000 Virginia Power customers lost power during the storms.  Frequent lightning was also a problem, though there were no house fires, and no injuries were reported.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This intense convection developed well ahead of a strong cold front.  The storms resulted in one fatality and three injuries.  An elderly man was instantly killed at Ellenville in Ulster County, when a large tree limb fell on him.  Two injuries occurred in Fulton County and one injury in Montgomery County.  The injuries were the result of fallen tree limbs and wires.  Across the region the damaging winds knocked out power to approximately 40,000 customers, broke several power poles and damaged dozens of homes due to fallen trees or large branches.  Damage was most widespread in Montgomery, Fulton, Saratoga, Warren and Washington Counties.  State Highway 9N south of Bolton Landing in Warren County and route 4 in the Whitehall area in northern Washington County, were closed through the evening hours due to tree debris.  At North Winfield in southern Herkimer County, a silo collapsed in the damaging winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The thunderstorm formed in northeast Guernsey County about 430 pm just ahead of another very intense thunderstorm moving through Muskingum County.  It then moved southeast at nearly 40 mph.The swath of damage produced by this intense downburst of wind was estimated to be nearly 8 miles long.  Its width fluctuated between 0.75 miles to over 2.5 miles.  The damage started just south of Cambridge and continued southeast to near the town of Buffalo.  There were 3 reported injuries which consisted of cuts and abrasions.  One person was treated and released from the hospital. The town of Byesville was hardest hit.  Hundreds of trees were snapped or toppled.  Power lines and telephone poles were also downed which resulted in widespread power outages.  There were some outbuildings destroyed, as well as damage to shingles, siding and roofs.  Part of a roof of a school was torn off.  Billboards, business signs and Interstate highway signs were also partially or totally destroyed.  It was also reported that about 30 automobiles in a grocery store parking lot had their windows completely shattered.  A plate glass window in a fast food restaurant was also shattered.  The area was declared a disaster area by the Governor of Ohio. On Interstate 77, there was a report of a tractor-trailed truck which was stopped in its tracks by the tremendous gust as it tried to move forward.  It actually spun its wheels as if it were on ice without moving and an automobile behind it collided with the truck.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 400K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The warm weather culminated on the 6th, when Detroit reached a high of 69 degrees - the warmest reading ever in Detroit in December.  However, a powerful cold front swung through the state late in the evening on the 6th.  A thin line of showers and thunderstorms accompanied the front, moving east at about 50 mph.  Many of the storms along the line produced wind damage.  The result was a December severe weather episode - a rather uncommon event for Michigan.  Most of the wind damage occurred immediately behind the line of convection, and the majority of the damage involved the downing of trees, large limbs, and power lines.The majority of the severe weather occurred near or south of Interstate 69.  The most notable exception to this was a swath of wind damage across southern Sanilac County, from Marlette to Lexington.  Barns and silos were destroyed near Marlette, and a home was deroofed.A more spotty damage path roughly followed I-69 from Davison to Port Huron.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph wind in Davison.  Limbs and power lines were downed further east, in Lapeer and Port Huron.  Damage was also spotty across Livingston, Oakland, and Macomb Counties.  In Oakland County, the National Weather Service office in White Lake measured a 63 mph gust.  In Farmington, a home was heavily damaged when it was struck by a large evergreen.  A tree fell onto a vehicle on Middlebelt Road in West Bloomfield Township, and the two occupants suffered minor injuries.  In Birmingham, the walls of a construction project were blown over, while in Troy, a billboard was shredded by severe winds.  The city of Utica in Macomb County was especially hard hit, with many trees and power lines downed.Damage was a little heavier across Washtenaw and Wayne Counties.  A barn was destroyed near Manchester.  A 64 mph gust was measured at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, while Detroit Metropolitan Airport had a 60 mph gust.  In between those two sites, heavy damage occurred in Ypsilanti and at nearby Willow Run Airport.  Three apartments suffered extensive roof damage near Ypsilanti, and a home was damaged by a falling tree.  At Willow Run Airport, many planes were tossed about, resulting in the destruction of 4 planes, and damage to another half-dozen or so.  In Livonia, a metal shed was thrown into a yard two homes down from where it started.  In addition, the walls of a drug store under construction were toppled.  Nativity scenes were thrown about in Plymouth and Romulus.  An historic elm tree lost large limbs in Lincoln Park, a nearby school suffered substantial roof damage, and a dry cleaners under construction was damaged.  In Trenton, a trampoline became airborne and flew into nearby tree limbs and power lines, downing them.Damage was isolated in the southernmost tier of counties.  A tree fell on a home in Devils Lake, and an uprooted tree came crashing down onto a garage in Monroe.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 60K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Incredibly powerful, hurricane-force straight-line winds, with peak gusts of 100 to 128 mph tore through 12 counties in this part of the state, while another 8 counties had peak gusts of 60 to 80 mph.  Residents noted that the strongest winds only lasted a minute or two, but gusty winds hung on for 15 to 30 minutes.  Meteorologically,  a solid squall line developed in southern Minnesota and gathered strength as it raced east with a translational speed of 50 to 60 mph across southcentral and southeast Wisconsin. The squall line was orientated southwest to northeast and had many microbursts and macrobursts embedded in it.  Whereas all 20 counties in southcentral and southeast Wisconsin reported scattered to widespread wind damage, there were 5 main corridor, or swaths of concentrated micro/macroburst damage: 1) central Sauk county through northern Dane county through northern Jefferson county and southern Dodge county through Waukesha county and into Milwaukee county, 2) eastcentral Columbia county across northern Dodge county through southeast Fond du Lac county and through southern Sheboygan county, 3) West Bend area of central Washington county east to the Port Washington area of Ozaukee county, 4) southeast Iowa county into northwest Green county, and 5) northwest to central part of Lafayette county. Newspaper headlines used a variety of words to describe this event: war zone, devastating, unbelievable, wicked wind, blown to bits, amazing, "Nature's Spring Cleaning," and "traveling back to the dark ages."Utility companies and Emergency Managers stated that this was the most damaging, widespread, straight-line thunderstorm wind event to affect southern Wisconsin in the past100 years!  Estimated, monetary damage amounts for all 20 counties were $55.852 million for residental or mobile homes, businesses, utilities buildings, agriculture buildings, signs, street lights, billboards, campers, and boats; and $1.485 million in crop and livestock losses.

This particular derecho formed in South Dakota on the evening of Saturday, May 30th, and raced eastward at 70 mph across Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, before striking Michigan's Lower Peninsula around 4:30 am EDT Sunday morning, May 31st. The derecho event produced widespread 60 to 90 mph wind gusts, which caused extensive tree and structural damage and left over 861,000 homes and businesses without electricity across Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan). There were 4 storm-related fatalities reported in the state and 146 injuries (mostly minor). Statewide, approximately 250 homes were destroyed, 12,250 homes damaged, 34 businesses destroyed, and 829 businesses damaged. Damage estimates across the above listed counties totaled over $166 Million. 	NWS Storm Damage Field Studies suggested highest wind gusts in wet microbursts reached 120 to 130 mph in Spring Lake (Ottawa County) and Walker (Kent County), 100 mph in portions of Montcalm County (including Cody Lake and Stanton), 90 mph in Rockford (Kent County) and Zeeland (Ottawa County), and 80 mph in Big Rapids (Mecosta County), Ludington (Mason County), Sparta (Kent County), and northern Osceola County. On June 24th, President Clinton declared 13 Michigan counties federal disaster areas, including the following 10 from the NWSO Grand Rapids County Warning Area: Clinton, Gratiot, Ionia, Kent, Mason, Montcalm, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oceana, and Ottawa. It took up to 10 days to fully restore power to certain areas including the City of Walker and portions of Montcalm and Gratiot Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Michigan State Police EMD's Damage and Injury Assessment Report indicated $502,700 in public damage costs, 910 homes damaged, 2 homes destroyed, and 131 businesses damaged. Private property damage estimates were not available. Damage was widespread across the county, with the cities of St. Johns, Elsie, Ovid, and De Witt especially hard-hit. Law enforcement officials reported a 62-year old man was killed in Victor Township on Tuesday, June 2nd, while attempting to clear debris. He was cutting a tree into pieces with a chainsaw when a large limb sprang up and killed him. Clinton County declared a local state of emergency and was granted a Governor's disaster declaration to activate state assistance for the county. On June 24th, President Clinton granted a Major Disaster Declaration for Clinton County, making federal disaster assistance available.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 502.7K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Incredibly powerful, hurricane-force straight-line winds, with peak gusts of 100 to 128 mph tore through 12 counties in this part of the state, while another 8 counties had peak gusts of 60 to 80 mph.  Residents noted that the strongest winds only lasted a minute or two, but gusty winds hung on for 15 to 30 minutes.  Meteorologically,  a solid squall line developed in southern Minnesota and gathered strength as it raced east with a translational speed of 50 to 60 mph across southcentral and southeast Wisconsin. The squall line was orientated southwest to northeast and had many microbursts and macrobursts embedded in it.  Whereas all 20 counties in southcentral and southeast Wisconsin reported scattered to widespread wind damage, there were 5 main corridor, or swaths of concentrated micro/macroburst damage: 1) central Sauk county through northern Dane county through northern Jefferson county and southern Dodge county through Waukesha county and into Milwaukee county, 2) eastcentral Columbia county across northern Dodge county through southeast Fond du Lac county and through southern Sheboygan county, 3) West Bend area of central Washington county east to the Port Washington area of Ozaukee county, 4) southeast Iowa county into northwest Green county, and 5) northwest to central part of Lafayette county. Newspaper headlines used a variety of words to describe this event: war zone, devastating, unbelievable, wicked wind, blown to bits, amazing, "Nature's Spring Cleaning," and "traveling back to the dark ages."Utility companies and Emergency Managers stated that this was the most damaging, widespread, straight-line thunderstorm wind event to affect southern Wisconsin in the past100 years!  Estimated, monetary damage amounts for all 20 counties were $55.852 million for residental or mobile homes, businesses, utilities buildings, agriculture buildings, signs, street lights, billboards, campers, and boats; and $1.485 million in crop and livestock losses.  As a sign of the wind power, many concrete silo's had their tops blown off, and many barns flattened.  Many homes and other structures had their roofs peeled off.

Power was not completely restored until the evening of the 4th.  This was the fourth worst and the greatest non-winter storm to affect the PECO Energy service area in its 50 year history.  About 336,000 customers lost power throughout their service area and PECO Energy distributed about 365,000 pounds of dry ice.  Sections of major roads such as U.S. Route 1, and Pennsylvania State Routes 41, 52, 82 and 926 were closed by downed trees and wires.  Even in open sections, traffic crawled due to non working traffic lights.  Roads were still closed in Birmingham, East Fallowfield, Highland, London Grove, Londonderry and New Garden Townships the night of June 1st.  Five southern Chester County School districts had to cancel classes on Monday, June 1st.  One could not reopen until Wednesday, June 3rd.   The line of severe thunderstorms entered the county in West Fallowfield and Lower Oxford Townships about 1240 a.m. EDT on June 1st and wasted no time causing damage.  In Lower Oxford Township poles along Pennsylvania State Route 10 were snapped and Pennsylvania State Route 896 was partially blocked by downed trees.  In West Fallowfield Township, the thunderstorms hit the King Road area of Cochranville the hardest.  About 30 homes were damaged.  A couple of mobile homes were either crushed or severely damaged by fallen trees.  One woman was temporarily trapped.  Several barns or silos were also destroyed.  On one plot over 100 trees were uprooted.  The Red Cross worked with thirteen displaced families in the area.   The first tornado of the night touched down in Londonderry Township at about 12:43 a.m. EDT on June 1st.  The touchdown occurred just north of the intersection of Fernwood and Jackson Roads.  The tornado moved west to east into West Marlborough Township.  It was there it reached its maximum intensity.  The tornado continued to travel almost due east and lifted in the extreme eastern part of the township near Pennsylvania State Route 842.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down, but structural damage since this tornado passed through relatively rural areas was minimal.  The tornado stayed on the ground for about 6 miles and its width was about 100 yards. Even though the tornado lifted,  wind damage continued farther east into East Marlborough Township.  Hundreds of trees were uprooted, at least one vehicle was crushed and a flag pole was bent to the ground.  In northern parts of London Grove Township, a couple of mobile homes were overturned and a tree crushed a garage.   At one point during the night, all major roads were closed in New Garden Township due to downed trees and wires.  As the line headed farther east, almost all of Kenneth Square lost power as large trees were uprooted.  Many homes and vehicles were hit by trees.  Included in the tree casualties, was a 140-year-old Kentucky Coffee Tree, which was one of the oldest in the eastern part of Pennsylvania.   As the line went farther east, it dropped the second tornado of the night.  At about 12:52 a.m. EDT a tornado touched down in the far eastern part of Pocopson Township along Pennsylvania State Route 52 just to the west of the Brandywine River and the intersections of Pennsylvania State Routes 52 and 100.  The tornado moved northwest to southeast into Birmingham Township and intensified into a F1 tornado and caused damage.  The tornado lifted just west of the Dilworthtown Inn in Dilworthtown near the Delaware County line.  Hundreds of trees were down with power lines down in over one hundred locations.  At least five homes had roof and window damage.  The Spring Meadows Development had some of the worst damage with a couple of homes and several vehicles struck by fallen trees.  The tornado was on the ground for about 3 miles and its width was about 100 yards.  It appears as though the winds in this tornado reached near the high end of the F1 scale and probably were close to 100 mph at its maximum intensity.The wind damage was not done in Chester County.  The line of severe thunderstorms sheared off part of the side of a house in West Chester.  In Easttown, eight roads were closed because of downed trees.  While most of the wind damage was in the southern half of the county, a thunderstorm in the far northern part of the county also turned severe in East and South Coventry Townships.  In Bucktown in South Coventry Township, one tree fell on a home and damaged some of its shingles and rain spouts.  In East Coventry Township, six roads were at least partially blocked by downed trees.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Incredibly powerful, hurricane-force straight-line winds, with peak gusts of 100 to 128 mph tore through 12 counties in this part of the state, while another 8 counties had peak gusts of 60 to 80 mph.  Residents noted that the strongest winds only lasted a minute or two, but gusty winds hung on for 15 to 30 minutes.  Meteorologically,  a solid squall line developed in southern Minnesota and gathered strength as it raced east with a translational speed of 50 to 60 mph across southcentral and southeast Wisconsin. The squall line was orientated southwest to northeast and had many microbursts and macrobursts embedded in it.  Whereas all 20 counties in southcentral and southeast Wisconsin reported scattered to widespread wind damage, there were 5 main corridor, or swaths of concentrated micro/macroburst damage: 1) central Sauk county through northern Dane county through northern Jefferson county and southern Dodge county through Waukesha county and into Milwaukee county, 2) eastcentral Columbia county across northern Dodge county through southeast Fond du Lac county and through southern Sheboygan county, 3) West Bend area of central Washington county east to the Port Washington area of Ozaukee county, 4) southeast Iowa county into northwest Green county, and 5) northwest to central part of Lafayette county. Newspaper headlines used a variety of words to describe this event: war zone, devastating, unbelievable, wicked wind, blown to bits, amazing, "Nature's Spring Cleaning," and "traveling back to the dark ages."Utility companies and Emergency Managers stated that this was the most damaging, widespread, straight-line thunderstorm wind event to affect southern Wisconsin in the past100 years!  Estimated, monetary damage amounts for all 20 counties were $55.852 million for residental or mobile homes, businesses, utilities buildings, agriculture buildings, signs, street lights, billboards, campers, and boats; and $1.485 million in crop and livestock losses.  As a sign of the wind power, many concrete silo's had their tops blown off, and many barns flattened.  Many homes and other structures had their roofs peeled off.  Thousands of large trees were either uprooted or broken/twisted by the winds.  Hundreds of power poles were snapped or pushed over by the winds, or falling trees/branches. At one time, about 60,000 customers were without electricity in southcentral Wisconsin, and about 170,000 in southeast Wisconsin.  Some residences or businesses were without power for as much as 5 or 6 days due to deluge of utility repairs and shortage of replacement power poles.

Incredibly powerful, hurricane-force straight-line winds, with peak gusts of 100 to 128 mph tore through 12 counties in this part of the state, while another 8 counties had peak gusts of 60 to 80 mph.  Residents noted that the strongest winds only lasted a minute or two, but gusty winds hung on for 15 to 30 minutes.  Meteorologically,  a solid squall line developed in southern Minnesota and gathered strength as it raced east with a translational speed of 50 to 60 mph across southcentral and southeast Wisconsin. The squall line was orientated southwest to northeast and had many microbursts and macrobursts embedded in it.  Whereas all 20 counties in southcentral and southeast Wisconsin reported scattered to widespread wind damage, there were 5 main corridor, or swaths of concentrated micro/macroburst damage: 1) central Sauk county through northern Dane county through northern Jefferson county and southern Dodge county through Waukesha county and into Milwaukee county, 2) eastcentral Columbia county across northern Dodge county through southeast Fond du Lac county and through southern Sheboygan county, 3) West Bend area of central Washington county east to the Port Washington area of Ozaukee county, 4) southeast Iowa county into northwest Green county, and 5) northwest to central part of Lafayette county. Newspaper headlines used a variety of words to describe this event: war zone, devastating, unbelievable, wicked wind, blown to bits, amazing, "Nature's Spring Cleaning," and "traveling back to the dark ages."Utility companies and Emergency Managers stated that this was the most damaging, widespread, straight-line thunderstorm wind event to affect southern Wisconsin in the past100 years!  Estimated, monetary damage amounts for all 20 counties were $55.852 million for residental or mobile homes, businesses, utilities buildings, agriculture buildings, signs, street lights, billboards, campers, and boats; and $1.485 million in crop and livestock losses.

Numerous trees and power lines were knocked down and three persons driving in vehicles were injured by fallen trees.   PECO energy reported about 185,000 homes and businesses in their service area lost power, 40,000 of them within and especially in Eastern Montgomery County.  Power was restored to everyone midday on Thursday July 2nd.  In Whitpain Township a driver was injured when a large tree split about 20 feet above the ground and one of its limbs pierced a window.  In Abington, two persons were injured when a large tree limb trapped them within their Blazer.  Another driver in Horsham was uninjured, but trapped inside his vehicle.  The hardest hit municipalities included Abington, Bryn Athyn, Lower Merion, Lower Moreland, Plymouth Meeting, Pottstown, Skippack, Springfield and Upper Salford Townships.  For the second time within about a month, trees were down all over the place in Lower Moreland Township. Trees fell onto houses in Abington, Bryn Athyn,  Horsham, Perkiomenville and Upper Dublin Townships.  Numerous vehicles were also damaged by fallen trees. Four streets were closed in Upper Moreland Township.  Four streets were still blocked the next day in Lower Merion Township.  Traffic was also slowed on the Schuylkill Expressway because of downed limbs.   About a half dozen trees were also uprooted on the Meadowlands Country Club in Whitpain Township.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Some of the highest wind gusts included 74 mph at RFD at 1159 CST, 73 MPH at Carol Stream at 1236 CST, 80 mph at Joliet at 1253 pm CST, 61 mph at Burbank at 1300 CST and 67 mph at Midlothian at around 1310 CST. Four inch diameter tree limbs were blown down in southern Winnebago County. Tree damage was widespread across northern Ogle County, including trees and limbs on houses. State Roads 72 and 64 were down to one lane in places. The roof of Byron High School was damaged. There was also extensive damage to corn crops. Trees and power lines were down in Lee County. Trees and power lines were damaged in northern De Kalb County. A state trooper estimated winds in excess of 60 mph. A semi-tractor trailer driver was injured at Kirkland. A student suffered a broken leg and 10 other people had minor injuries at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb when the winds blew down tents and other debris at a display. In Kane County, trees were down at Elburn and signs were blown over at the Aurora toll plaza on I-88. A large tree fell on a house in Aurora. Large trees were blown down in northern Kendall County. In Minooka in northeast Grundy County winds gusted to 40 to 50 mph which caused a building under construction to collapse. A man was injured when he was trapped under the collapsed wall. In Du Page County , the roof was torn off a lumber store in Wheaton, a wall of a building under construction came down in Naperville and there was extensive damage to trees and houses in Wheaton and Lisle. A 39 year old worker was critically injured when he fell two stories from the roof of a building in Schaumburg. In Will County high winds damaged a roof at a shopping center in Crest Hill/Joliet, and tree limbs to 5 inches in diameter came down. Trees were also downed in Frankfort, New Lenox, Manhattan, Beecher, and Crete.  In Cook County, a day care center in Bridgeview had part of its roof torn off and windows broken. A CTA bus shelter blew over in the far southwest side of Chicago injuring a woman.  Part of the roof was peeled of Marist High School in the far southwest side of Chicago.

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 825K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.

Across the city of Pittsburgh, the North Hills area reported numerous trees, branches, and power lines down across an area one to two miles wide and nearly five miles in length.  Many homes were damaged by falling trees and branches.  The Larouche College area was especially hard hit with significant roof and window damage.

Elsewhere, hail, high winds, lightning, and torrential rains played havoc. In West Bend (Washington Co.), lightning ignited a fire in an apartment complex and caused a quarter of a million dollars in damage. Urban flooding in Janesville (Rock Co.) resulted in standing water between a foot to a foot and a half deep across area roadways.  Wind damage was the most common culprit though with over 200 power lines downed and 17,000 customers without service in southeast Wisconsin and 10,000 residents left without power across south-central Wisconsin.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Numerous trees were uprooted and fell on cars and wires on the campus.  More tree damage occurred along Middle Country Road and Mooney Pond Road in Selden.The first wave also included a line of thunderstorms that moved east across Orange County.  Thunderstorms produced high winds that downed trees in Goshen and Chester.  A funnel cloud was also observed between Goshen and Chester.The second wave included lines of severe thunderstorms that produced high winds, large hail, and frequent lightning.  This resulted in widespread damage across the region.In Orange County, high winds downed many trees and power lines.  Significant damage to trees and houses occurred in Monroe and Newburgh.  High winds also blew a trailer upside down on Bark Lane, off Big Island Road in Florida.  Four people were injured and required medical treatment at Arden Hill Hospital.

Numerous funnel clouds were sited along the leading edge of the storm and a few non-supercell tornadoes were masked within a large area of damaging winds.  Straightline winds from 60 to over 120 mph produced the most serious damage with these storms and 8 counties in Eastern Iowa were declaired disaster areas.  School-net stations measured winds at 69 mph in Cedar Rapids and 123 mph at Washington.  Across the county warning area sustained winds of  70 to 80 mph ripped down trees, power lines, and windmills, and knocked over farm buildings, grain bins and silos.  One barn in Benton County housing a cargo van and thousands of dollars worth of antiques was blown on it's side.  At another property 40 pine trees standing 30 feet high were snapped off.  Widespread crop damage was also reported as the winds snapped off brittle corn stalks.   Three large Co-operative grain bins in Belle Plaine (Benton County) and two more at Lost Nation and Clarence (Clinton County) were destroyed, and at Wapello (Louisa County) a half million bushel grain bin was crumpled.  Serious damage was also received at 5 other Co-op grain bin sites.  Churches in Hills, and Marengo had their steeples ripped off.

Hardest hit was the Lake Geneva (Walworth Co.) area where downburst winds leveled hundreds of large trees, several street signs,  and a large quantity of commercial signs.  A dozen vehicles were damaged or totaled and 2 homes sustained significant damage. A 100 mph wind was recorded at the Grand Geneva Airport and 2 people were injured (one in a moving vehicle). Local officials consider this to be the worst storm in 58 years. In Monroe (Green Co.), the powerful thunderstorm winds also damaged 6 vehicles and 2 homes.  Elsewhere, hail, high winds, lightning, and torrential rains played havoc. In West Bend (Washington Co.), lightning ignited a fire in an apartment complex and caused a quarter of a million dollars in damage. Urban flooding in Janesville (Rock Co.) resulted in standing water between a foot to a foot and a half deep across area roadways.  Wind damage was the most common culprit though with over 200 power lines downed and 17,000 customers without service in southeast Wisconsin and 10,000 residents left without power across south-central Wisconsin.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One line of storms began at mid-afternoon from Raton to Las Vegas. This line moved southeastward and merged with a northward moving line which began south of Portales to north of Roswell. Torrential rains of 2 to 4 inches caused extensive road flooding as the line of storm merged over southern Quay County from San Jon and Wheatland west to Ragland. Storms bowed northward over the Logan and Ute Lake area of northern Quay County. A large microburst overturned several recreational vehicles and destroyed a number of boat sheds west of Logan. Damage to lighter storage buildings and utilities extended along a path of about 1 mile.

These storms quickly became severe and merged over Walworth County.  Hurricane-force winds were generated over the north side of Elkhorn (Walworth Co.); and the resultant wind damage strongly suggests that winds gusts peaked in the 100 to 110 mph range. Officials in Elkhorn declared a state of emergency and asked for extra help with the cleanup, thanks to hundreds of downed trees and many power lines. Several Elkhorn downtown office buildings suffered some minor damage, while 6 buildings on the north side along Highway 67 had considerable damage (3-minor, 1 major, and 1 destroyed).  Thirteen people were injured and 14 vehicles sustained damage. This wicked dowburst then traveld through rural farmland east to the Walworth county line, destroying 3 farm buildings in the process.    Altogether, about 27.000 customers in Walworth County lost electrical power.  Further east, this wet macroburst became wider and left a path of damage or destruction about 6 to 8 miles wide across northern Kenosha County and southern Racine County.  In the Burlington area (Racine Co.), 300 trees were downed and many powerline or poles, leaving 15,000 customers were left without power. A plane tied down at the Burlington airport was tossed over, and rowboats on a local lake were damaged.  Elsewhere in southern Racine County,  traffic lights were damaged, the Great Lakes Dragway was closed, and the YMCA toboggan slide was destroyed. In Kenosha county 7 semi-trailer tractors were blown over on Interstate-94 west of Somers (Kenosha Co.)!  The downburst swath in northern Kenosha County also damaged several corn fields, downed hundreds of trees, leveled a barn near Somers, and damaged several homes. One account was that the town of Somers looked like a bomb exploded ater the storms passed through.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system dragged a warm front northeastward across central New York.  A southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for severe weather that afternoon and evening as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From early in the afternoon until the evening hours, central New York was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, six separate tornadoes touched down on this day in central New York.  The most devastating twister cut a discontinuous sixty plus mile track from southeastern Tioga county across southern Broome county and into Delaware county where it finally lifted back into the cloud base.  This tornado alone damaged or destroyed more than 30 homes and injured nearly 20 people.  Very fortunately, no fatalities occurred.  Another violent tornado ripped through southern sections of Otsego county between Laurens and Milford.  Thousands of trees were snapped off or uprooted with large sections of forest completely taken out.  Several residences were leveled and many roads were impassable for days due to the fallen debris.  The damage toll from this day's tornadoes ran into the millions.     Several strong bow echo complexes also affected central New York.  From southern Chenango county through the lower half of Otsego county, one such storm took out hundreds of trees and inflicted considerable structural damage in and around Oneonta.  One man was killed in Oneonta when hit by a falling tree limb.  Throughout Onondaga county, wind gusts estimated at 90 to 100 mph caused widespread damage early in the evening between 6:00 and 6:30 pm EDT.  Two large transmission towers near Nedrow were toppled from the winds and many buildings had blown out windows and/or roof damage.     Hail as large as 3 to 4 inches in diameter accompanied some of the tornadic supercells across New York's southern tier; smashing windows, severely denting cars, and causing crop losses.  New York State Electric and Gas Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power during the height of the storms late that afternoon and evening.  Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Severe thunderstorms moved across the county during the afternoon.  Trees and wires were blown down in Cooperstown and Laurens between 4:30 and 4:35 pm EDT.  Numerous trees and wires were also downed by the wind in Schenevus at 4:45 pm and Oneonta at 4:50 pm EDT.  Transmission towers and large signs were also toppled in Oneonta.  Numerous roads were blocked due to the downed trees and many of them were closed for several hours.     In Oneonta, a 32 year old man was struck and killed by a large tree limb.  Several additonal injuries were sustained from flying debris.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This intense convection developed well ahead of a strong cold front.  The storms resulted in one fatality and three injuries.  An elderly man was instantly killed at Ellenville in Ulster County, when a large tree limb fell on him.  Two injuries occurred in Fulton County and one injury in Montgomery County.  The injuries were the result of fallen tree limbs and wires.  Across the region the damaging winds knocked out power to approximately 40,000 customers, broke several power poles and damaged dozens of homes due to fallen trees or large branches.  Damage was most widespread in Montgomery, Fulton, Saratoga, Warren and Washington Counties.  State Highway 9N south of Bolton Landing in Warren County and route 4 in the Whitehall area in northern Washington County, were closed through the evening hours due to tree debris.  At North Winfield in southern Herkimer County, a silo collapsed in the damaging winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 30K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Widespread structural damage resulted and tens of thousands of trees were toppled in northern portions of the county.  Direct human impact was also felt.  Two fatalities and seven injuries occurred at the New York State Fairgrounds in Geddes.       The bow echo complex first entered northwestern sections of the county just after 100 am EDT.  It initially tore through the Baldwinsville area, leaving many streets littered with downed trees and utility poles.  The storms progressed rapidly towards the east-southeast and affected an area from Clay across Onondaga Lake to Camillus and Geddes from 115 to 120 am EDT.  Severe damage was inflicted upon the State Fairgrounds in Geddes.  Most of the temporary holding structures or tents on the premises were either completely destroyed or sustained heavy damage.  Unfortunately, two individuals who were camping out before the last day of the New York State Fair died that night.  A 26 year old man was killed when he was struck by flying debris from a nearby building.  A 38 year old man, who was a vendor at the Fair, was killed when a large tree fell upon the tent where he was sleeping.  Seven other individuals had minor injuries, mostly cuts and scrapes from flying glass.  Three large flag poles at the entrance to the Fairgrounds were bent to almost a 45 degree angle from the force of the wind.  Many permanent buildings had roofs torn off, windows blown out, or siding severely damaged from felled trees.       In Marcellus and Camillus Townships, an estimated thousands of trees were blown down just in this area alone.  The Onondaga Hill section appeared to take on particularly severe damage with most roadways rendered completely impassable from downed trees and live wires.  Several homes also had various degrees of siding and roof damage in this vicinity, mainly from falling trees.     The storms then took aim on the Syracuse metropolitan area.  From approximately 125 to 135 am EDT, the city of Syracuse felt the brunt of the derecho.  An estimated many thousands of trees were toppled or damaged throughout the city.  One of the hardest hit sections was the Thornden Park area near Syracuse University.  In addition to tree damage, there was substantial structural damage (primarily roofs) to nearby homes and buildings.  Another fatality occurred in this vicinity when a large tree crashed through the roof of a home and struck an elderly woman who was sleeping.  She later died from extensive head injuries.  A textile factory had its roof almost completely torn away and many housing units for students at Syracuse University had blown out windows or damaged sections of the roof.  St. Lucy's Church, a sturdy brick structure, was nearly destroyed when its western steeple collapsed.  Many windows were also blown in at the University Hospital.  On the north side of town, an official wind gust to 75 mph was recorded at Hancock International Airport.       The storms maintained their intensity as they moved rapidly through the eastern suburbs.  Large hail to one inch in diameter was observed by a skywarn spotter in Manlius.  Another spotter in DeWitt measured a wind gust of 75 mph.  Much in the way of downed trees and structural damage was again reported.  A strip mall and fire station both in the town of Manlius had their roofs entirely torn off.  Two large antennas just south of Interstate 481 in DeWitt collapsed and interrupted local radio broadcasts.     In all, the financial toll from damage fell just short of 100 million dollars.  The final day of the New York State Fair was cancelled and the National Guard was called on to help with the cleanup efforts.  Onondaga county ultimately qualified for federal disaster funds after officials toured the area and reviewed post-storm damage surveys.  These surveys revealed a damage swath 10 to 12 miles long and nearly 30 miles wide.  Estimated peak wind gusts were near 115 mph.  Hundreds of thousands of people were without power for much of Labor Day.  Some customers did not have their power restored for the better part of a week.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 90M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several storms became severe and produced widespread hail and wind damage. Hail and wind lasted 15-20 minutes at some locations. Numerous trees and power lines were downed, some on homes, and numerous power outages occurred. In Marion, downed trees severely damaged a mobile home. In the town of Catawba, a shed was blown apart and siding taken off a garage. A 5 year old girl was injured in her mobile home when a tree struck it. The southern half of Iredell county and much of Rowan county seemed to be hardest hit with large swaths of damage from winds, at times as high as 70 to 90 mph. Power poles were downed along Interstate 77. Boats and docks were damaged along Lake Norman. A roof was blown off a mobile home and a deck was destroyed in Troutman. Trees were downed on homes and outbuildings near China Grove and in Salisbury, with a damage path of trees and power lines down all the way to High Rock Lake. A car was crushed by a tree and a roof was blown off a supply store north of China Grove. Funnel cloud sightings were common with the passage of the storms in these areas.In the town of Gilkey, in Rutherford county, a storage building was blown into the woods.

One fire fighter was injured during clean-up operations.   About 15 homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Four persons suffered smoke inhalation after downed wires ignited a fire in Building C of the Silver Ridge Apartments in Dover Township.  Twenty-four apartments were evacuated and two units were badly damaged leaving the families homeless.  A shelter was opened at the Toms River High School.In Berkeley Township, the hardest hit area was within the Holiday City area.  One home had its roof lifted and a wall of its garage torn away.  Attic fans were knocked off several homes.  Emergency personnel responded to 42 calls for assistance. In Dover Township, one of the hardest hit areas was along New Jersey State Route 37 in Toms River.  Three homes on Michelle Drive were badly damaged by downed trees.  One home had a downed tree in its swimming pool.  Several business along State Route 37 had either roof damage and/or windows smashed.  Wind damage also occurred along Lakehurst Road east to the Community Medical Center  and the Toms River Country Club.  The squall line also uprooted trees in Manchester Township, Pine Beach, Ocean Gate and Beachwood Boroughs.  Lightning apparently burned a home to the ground within Beachwood Borough.

This particular derecho formed in South Dakota on the evening of Saturday, May 30th, and raced eastward at 70 mph across Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, before striking Michigan's Lower Peninsula around 4:30 am EDT Sunday morning, May 31st. The derecho event produced widespread 60 to 90 mph wind gusts, which caused extensive tree and structural damage and left over 861,000 homes and businesses without electricity across Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan). There were 4 storm-related fatalities reported in the state and 146 injuries (mostly minor). Statewide, approximately 250 homes were destroyed, 12,250 homes damaged, 34 businesses destroyed, and 829 businesses damaged. Damage estimates across the above listed counties totaled over $166 Million. 	NWS Storm Damage Field Studies suggested highest wind gusts in wet microbursts reached 120 to 130 mph in Spring Lake (Ottawa County) and Walker (Kent County), 100 mph in portions of Montcalm County (including Cody Lake and Stanton), 90 mph in Rockford (Kent County) and Zeeland (Ottawa County), and 80 mph in Big Rapids (Mecosta County), Ludington (Mason County), Sparta (Kent County), and northern Osceola County. On June 24th, President Clinton declared 13 Michigan counties federal disaster areas, including the following 10 from the NWSO Grand Rapids County Warning Area: Clinton, Gratiot, Ionia, Kent, Mason, Montcalm, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oceana, and Ottawa. It took up to 10 days to fully restore power to certain areas including the City of Walker and portions of Montcalm and Gratiot Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Michigan State Police EMD's Damage and Injury Assessment Report indicated $453,000 in public damage costs, 23 injuries, 6 individuals being sheltered, 400 homes damaged, 30 homes destroyed, 40 businesses damaged, and 50 vacation residences either damaged or destroyed. Private property damage was estimated around $13.5 Million. Most severe damage was reported in Pierson and Maple Valley Townships in the western panhandle of the county, with several cottages destroyed and damaged near and around Cody Lake and other area lakes. Significant damage was also reported in and around the city of Stanton. A team from the Michigan National Guard was deployed to the city of Stanton to assist in debris removal and cleanup operations. Montcalm County declared a local state of emergency and was granted a Governor's disaster declaration to activate state assistance for the county. On June 24th, President Clinton granted a Major Disaster Declaration for Montcalm County, making federal disaster assistance available.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 14M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's "gust front" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently "microbursts" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.  Overall, approximately twelve people sustained injuries and damage was estimated around $16 million.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system dragged a warm front northeastward across central New York.  A southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for severe weather that afternoon and evening as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From early in the afternoon until the evening hours, central New York was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, six separate tornadoes touched down on this day in central New York.  The most devastating twister cut a discontinuous sixty plus mile track from southeastern Tioga county across southern Broome county and into Delaware county where it finally lifted back into the cloud base.  This tornado alone damaged or destroyed more than 30 homes and injured nearly 20 people.  Very fortunately, no fatalities occurred.  Another violent tornado ripped through southern sections of Otsego county between Laurens and Milford.  Thousands of trees were snapped off or uprooted with large sections of forest completely taken out.  Several residences were leveled and many roads were impassable for days due to the fallen debris.  The damage toll from this day's tornadoes ran into the millions.     Several strong bow echo complexes also affected central New York.  From southern Chenango county through the lower half of Otsego county, one such storm took out hundreds of trees and inflicted considerable structural damage in and around Oneonta.  One man was killed in Oneonta when hit by a falling tree limb.  Throughout Onondaga county, wind gusts estimated at 90 to 100 mph caused widespread damage early in the evening between 6:00 and 6:30 pm EDT.  Two large transmission towers near Nedrow were toppled from the winds and many buildings had blown out windows and/or roof damage.     Hail as large as 3 to 4 inches in diameter accompanied some of the tornadic supercells across New York's southern tier; smashing windows, severely denting cars, and causing crop losses.  New York State Electric and Gas Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power during the height of the storms late that afternoon and evening.  Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Severe thunderstorms produced widespread damage across the county.  Trees and wires were blown down in Cooperstown and northern Burlington Flats between 3:30 and 3:40 pm EDT.  Several roads were blocked due to the downed trees and wires.  People were trapped in their vehicles by falling trees and some sustained injury from flying debris, broken glass, or falling wires.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 125K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These storms quickly became severe and merged over Walworth County.  Hurricane-force winds were generated over the north side of Elkhorn (Walworth Co.); and the resultant wind damage strongly suggests that winds gusts peaked in the 100 to 110 mph range. Officials in Elkhorn declared a state of emergency and asked for extra help with the cleanup, thanks to hundreds of downed trees and many power lines. Several Elkhorn downtown office buildings suffered some minor damage, while 6 buildings on the north side along Highway 67 had considerable damage (3-minor, 1 major, and 1 destroyed).  Thirteen people were injured and 14 vehicles sustained damage. This wicked dowburst then traveld through rural farmland east to the Walworth county line, destroying 3 farm buildings in the process.    Altogether, about 27.000 customers in Walworth County lost electrical power.  Further east, this wet macroburst became wider and left a path of damage or destruction about 6 to 8 miles wide across northern Kenosha County and southern Racine County.  In the Burlington area (Racine Co.), 300 trees were downed and many powerline or poles, leaving 15,000 customers were left without power. A plane tied down at the Burlington airport was tossed over, and rowboats on a local lake were damaged.  Elsewhere in southern Racine County,  traffic lights were damaged, the Great Lakes Dragway was closed, and the YMCA toboggan slide was destroyed. In Kenosha county 7 semi-trailer tractors were blown over on Interstate-94 west of Somers (Kenosha Co.)!  The downburst swath in northern Kenosha County also damaged several corn fields, downed hundreds of trees, leveled a barn near Somers, and damaged several homes. One account was that the town of Somers looked like a bomb exploded ater the storms passed through.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.9M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This particular derecho formed in South Dakota on the evening of Saturday, May 30th, and raced eastward at 70 mph across Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, before striking Michigan's Lower Peninsula around 4:30 am EDT Sunday morning, May 31st. The derecho event produced widespread 60 to 90 mph wind gusts, which caused extensive tree and structural damage and left over 861,000 homes and businesses without electricity across Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan). There were 4 storm-related fatalities reported in the state and 146 injuries (mostly minor). Statewide, approximately 250 homes were destroyed, 12,250 homes damaged, 34 businesses destroyed, and 829 businesses damaged. Damage estimates across the above listed counties totaled over $166 Million. 	NWS Storm Damage Field Studies suggested highest wind gusts in wet microbursts reached 120 to 130 mph in Spring Lake (Ottawa County) and Walker (Kent County), 100 mph in portions of Montcalm County (including Cody Lake and Stanton), 90 mph in Rockford (Kent County) and Zeeland (Ottawa County), and 80 mph in Big Rapids (Mecosta County), Ludington (Mason County), Sparta (Kent County), and northern Osceola County. On June 24th, President Clinton declared 13 Michigan counties federal disaster areas, including the following 10 from the NWSO Grand Rapids County Warning Area: Clinton, Gratiot, Ionia, Kent, Mason, Montcalm, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oceana, and Ottawa. It took up to 10 days to fully restore power to certain areas including the City of Walker and portions of Montcalm and Gratiot Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Michigan State Police EMD Damage and Injury Assessment Report indicated $2,458,958 in public damage costs, 42 homes destroyed, 1805 homes damaged, 5 businesses destroyed, and 73 businesses damaged. Two injuries were reported. Total public and private costs have been estimated at $24,205,908 according to FEMA and local media reports. Numerous local roads were closed during the day of May 31st for tree and debris removal. Approximately 50% of the city of Whitehall was left without water service and 50,000 customers were left without power in Muskegon County. The Muskegon Chronicle reported 5 large transmission towers were toppled northeast of the city of Muskegon. These towers carried high voltage electricity and were designed to withstand sustained 90 mph winds and gusts to 110 mph. The Muskegon Chronicle also reported severe crop damage to fruit trees (including apple, cherry, and peach) in the southeast part of Muskegon County. Estimated crop damage was $5.0 Million. Severe tree damage was reported in Muskegon State Park, Hoffmaster State Park, and Duck Lake State Park, all bordering Lake Michigan. Muskegon County declared a local state of emergency and was granted a Governor's disaster declaration to activate state assistance for the county. On June 24th, President Clinton granted a Major Disaster Declaration for Muskegon County, making federal disaster assistance available.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 24.21M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms fired up as warm air over ran the cooler air at the surface.  Storms formed over Nebraska and moved into western Iowa during the mid evening hours, then continued to advance east across the state.  For the most part the storms produced high winds with wind gusts to 70 MPH or more at times.  Winds gusted to 77 MPH west of Greenfield in Adair County.  There were numerous reports of trees and power lines downed.  One injury occurred in Union County as campers were overturned at Green Valley State Park by the high winds. Another injury occurred in Cass County when 65 to 80 MPH winds blew through.  Three semi-tractortrailers and one car were overturned by high winds in Interstate 80.   There were also many reports of farm sheds and buildings being damaged or destroyed by the winds.  Some building damage was reported in Creston.  A barn and farm shed was destroyed by high winds in Wayne County near Seymour.  Early in the storms development, a small tornado touched down in Cass County north of Anita.  The tornado destroyed several sheds and grain bins there.  In addition to the wind, there were numerous reports of marble size hail.  Hail was not a major event with these storms however.  The only large hail reports came early on in the event with golf ball size hail at Brayton in Audubon County, and one inch diameter hail reported in Cass County northwest of Atlantic.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Door county was particularly hard hit, as thunderstorms hit a park and campground west and south of Sturgeon Bay.  Three people suffered minor injuries at a camping resort south of Sturgeon Bay as winds at least 75 mph knocked over camping trailers and trees.  Another person was injured at Potawatomi State Park as a tree fell on his tent.  Three barns were destroyed, over 20 houses sustained damage, and the grandstand at Door County Fair Park was damaged.  A little later in the morning, lightning struck a house in the town of Gardner.  Total damage in Door county alone topped $150,000.The town of Rudolph (Wood co.) was hard hit, too, as winds reached over 70 mph, damaging buildings and uprooting or splitting trees.  A roof was torn off of a trailer home, a barn was flattened, a silo was damaged and many trees were knocked down.  The same storm produced damage at a camp in Rosholt (Portage co.), toppling over 500 trees on the 440-acre campus.  Several of the trees damaged roofs of buildings.  None of the 150 campers and 60 counselors were injured.  A storm that hit Wien (Marathon co.) blew a 115 foot wooden steeple off a church.Lightning struck a storage building in Cassel township (Marathon co.), causing damage to the building's contents.   In Oconto county, the steeple of a church in Klondike was struck by lightning and set on fire.  Lightning started two fires in Brown county.  One occurred at a tubing plant in De Pere; another lightning strike hit a residence near Holland, causing damage to a wall in the house.  In Outagamie county, lightning struck a 100-year old school, damaging the cupola and roof.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.4M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Much wind damage resulted.  Most of the damage was in the form of downed trees and power lines, but there was a concentrated area of structural damage from Port Byron southwestward to Montezuma.     The line of severe thunderstorms first entered the county around 100 am EDT and affected an area from Montezuma to Throop to Port Byron between 100 and 110 am.  It was in this region that the greatest damage occurred in the county.  In the town of Port Byron, a 150 year old Presbyterian Church was nearly leveled by the ferocity of the wind.  Portions of its steeple and bell tower were blown several hundred yards and actually caused some damage to adjacent structures.  In Montezuma and Throop, many trees and utility poles were uprooted, with several landing on nearby cars and homes.  Dozens of homes in this area sustained siding and/or roof damage.         In the city of Auburn, the storm came through around 115 am EDT and felled numerous trees and power lines.  On the north side of town, damage to homes was more pronounced with roofs torn off of several buidings, including a department store.  A few minor injuries were caused by flying debris in this section of town.  The storms exited the county shortly before 125 am EDT with more tree damage in the town of Owasco.  Ten vacation homes in the Highland Beach area on the eastern side of Owasco Lake took on minor damage in the form of blown out windows, ripped off shingles, and damaged aluminum siding.             Damage estimates were close to 20 million dollars for the county.  Portions of Port Byron and Auburn in the hardest hit areas were without electrical power for close to 3 days.  Cayuga county eventually qualified to receive federal disaster relief money.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This particular derecho formed in South Dakota on the evening of Saturday, May 30th, and raced eastward at 70 mph across Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, before striking Michigan's Lower Peninsula around 4:30 am EDT Sunday morning, May 31st. The derecho event produced widespread 60 to 90 mph wind gusts, which caused extensive tree and structural damage and left over 861,000 homes and businesses without electricity across Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan). There were 4 storm-related fatalities reported in the state and 146 injuries (mostly minor). Statewide, approximately 250 homes were destroyed, 12,250 homes damaged, 34 businesses destroyed, and 829 businesses damaged. Damage estimates across the above listed counties totaled over $166 Million. 	NWS Storm Damage Field Studies suggested highest wind gusts in wet microbursts reached 120 to 130 mph in Spring Lake (Ottawa County) and Walker (Kent County), 100 mph in portions of Montcalm County (including Cody Lake and Stanton), 90 mph in Rockford (Kent County) and Zeeland (Ottawa County), and 80 mph in Big Rapids (Mecosta County), Ludington (Mason County), Sparta (Kent County), and northern Osceola County. On June 24th, President Clinton declared 13 Michigan counties federal disaster areas, including the following 10 from the NWSO Grand Rapids County Warning Area: Clinton, Gratiot, Ionia, Kent, Mason, Montcalm, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oceana, and Ottawa. It took up to 10 days to fully restore power to certain areas including the City of Walker and portions of Montcalm and Gratiot Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Michigan State Police EMD's Damage and Injury Assessment Report indicated $4,336,751 in public damage costs, 53 injuries, 63 homes destroyed, 1196 homes damaged, 15 businesses destroyed, and 173 businesses damaged in Kent County, excluding the City of Grand Rapids (see separate Grand Rapids report). Private damage costs were estimated to be approximately $45.0 Million in the city of Walker alone. No other private damage costs were available from across the county. The storm damage was most severe in the cities of Rockford and Walker. Most city streets within the city limits of Rockford and Walker were left impassable. The city of Walker was closed to the public. Michigan State Police troopers assisted the city of Walker with security and a dawn to dusk curfew was enforced. A team from the Michigan National Guard was sent to the city of Walker to assist in debris removal and cleanup operations. Most of Walker was left without power as the power line infrastructure was destroyed. Damaged and destroyed businesses left 8,403 people unemployed. The Kent County fruitbelt, covering much of the northwest part of the county, received an estimated $20.0 Million in damages due to snapped and uprooted trees. Most damage was done to apple trees, but cherry and peach orchards were also damaged. Kent County declared a local state of emergency (as did the city of Walker) and was granted a Governor's disaster declaration to activate state assistance for the county. On June 24th, President Clinton granted a Major Disaster Declaration for Kent County, making available federal disaster assistance.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 49.34M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Overall, damage was dominated by numerous downed trees, large limbs, and power lines, though there were scattered occurrences of large hail.Montgomery Co was hardest hit.  Though no one area received major damage, nearly all communities in the eastern two-thirds of the county had some trees, large limbs, or wires down.  A portion of Woodfield Road (state route 124) was closed north of Gaithersburg; dozens of trees and large limbs were down along the state route 28 corridor from Darnestown to Rockville.  Farther south, fallen trees closed a portion of Persimmon Tree Road in Potomac.  The most harrowing experience occurred in Glen Echo, where two vehicles were damaged by a large limb and falling wires.  The two males were rescued; the woman was brought to a nearby hospital for observation.  In all, county emergency management officials reported a dozen trees on houses and several others on vehicles across the county.  The combination of wind and lightning knocked out power to over 40,000 Potomac Electric Power Co. customers in Montgomery and Prince George's Cos.Across northeastern Maryland, tree damage was confined to smaller limbs and some wires.  However, a slower moving storm dropped at least 1 1/2 inches of rain across central and eastern Harford Co, creating a period of flash flooding which required at least one rescue of a stranded vehicle.  Several reports of street flooding were received from both Aberdeen and Havre de Grace.Earlier, tree and wire damage was noted in southern Carroll and western Howard Cos, with the more substantial damage in Howard.  Baltimore Gas and Electric reported at least 10,000 customers lost electricity in these areas at the peak of the storm.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 35K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The storms focused on a pair of east-west oriented boundaries: one stretched across central lower Michigan, while the second was a weak warm front moving north into the southern portion of the state.  Thunderstorms near both boundaries became severe.Storms near the northern boundary were hail producers.  Golfball sized hail was reported by a spotter in Sanford, and also by the Michigan State Police northwest of Pinconning.  Dime to quarter sized hail was reported at a number of other locations in Midland and Bay Counties.Along the warm front, a large supercell developed in south-central Michigan.  It moved east and then turned southeast across southeast Michigan.  Hardest hit was Washtenaw County, most notably around Chelsea, and from Milan to Whittaker.  These locations were affected by parts of the supercell for an extended period of time.  Severe weather started in the area around and north of Chelsea, where golfball sized hail fell.  A lightning strike started a house fire north of Chelsea.  Quarter sized hail fell in Chelsea about 20 minutes later, but this part of the storm was more noted for the wind damage it caused.  Trees were downed in Sylvan, Chelsea, and Lima.  A truck was destroyed by a fallen tree in Sylvan, and a few homes in Chelsea were damaged in a similar manner.  Wind gusts also destroyed in barn in Lima.  The wind was estimated at 75 mph in Chelsea.The supercell covered the Milan-Whittaker area with golfball sized hail.  A spotter in Whittaker estimated 70 mph winds.  Again, a second component of the large supercell caused severe weather 15 to 20 minutes later.  This one also produced golfball sized hail in Milan, and emergency management officials estimated 70 mph winds just west of Whittaker.Although not hit as hard, the Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area also saw severe weather.  A spotter in Ann Arbor estimated 60 mph winds on the fringe of the supercell, while a spotter in Ypsilanti saw golfball sized hail and 75 mph winds.  Another spotter in Pittsfield saw dime sized hail.The supercell continued southeast into Lenawee and Monroe Counties.  Only the northeast corner of Lenawee County was grazed, as trees were downed near Macon.  Monroe County took a more substantial hit.  A golfer at Thorn Hills Golf Club, northeast of Maybee, was hurt when a large tree limb fell on him.  Trees were also downed in Dundee and Raisinville Township.  A spotter estimated 60 mph winds in Maybee, as did emergency management officials just south of Carleton.  Dime sized hail fell at the Fermi II Nuclear Power Plant.  Finally, a sheriff just east of Temperance estimated a gust of 60 mph.This supercell would go on to cause substantial damage in northern Ohio.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One of these storms developed into a supercell over southern Barry County. This supercell thunderstorm propagated east-southeast across Calhoun and Jackson Counties from approximately 4:20 pm until 5:45 pm EDT and spawned an F1 tornado and two damaging microbursts. The microburst which hit Pennfield Township in Calhoun County killed a 75-year old male and injured 2 females (one of which, a 13-year old female, was critically injured) when their respective modular homes were destroyed. NWS Grand Rapids officials estimated wind speeds reached 120 mph in the Pennfield Township downburst. The tornado did not result in any deaths or injuries, but did approximately $50,000 in damage just south of Bedford in Calhoun County.	Overall, downed trees and power lines and lightning strikes knocked out power to 22,000 in southern Michigan, most of which occurred in Barry, Calhoun, and Wayne Counties (in southeast Lower Michigan).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The same supercell thunderstorm which produced the F1 tornado in northwest Calhoun County produced a wet microburst as it moved across Pennfield Township. The downburst caused one fatality and 2 injuries approximately 1/2 mile south of Pennfield High School, just east of the Battle Creek River in the vicinity of Pony Street and Clarence Blvd. Approximately 12 homes sustained varying degrees of damage in this location. Two modular homes on adjacent properties along Clarence Blvd. were blown off their foundations and destroyed. A 75 year old man in the northernmost structure was killed, while a teenage girl who occupied the neighboring home was critically injured and her mother sustained minor injuries. A 20 foot camping trailer was hurled in a grove of small trees over 100 feet away and was demolished. In addition, several vehicles were damaged. A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Office in Grand Rapids revealed a unidirectional damage pattern associated with straight-line winds. It appeared a powerful wet microburst occurred in Pennfield Township as the severe thunderstorm mesocyclone weakened. Wind speeds were estimated to have reached 120 mph at the damage site.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's "gust front" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently "microbursts" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's "gust front" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently "microbursts" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.  Overall, approximately twelve people sustained injuries and damage was estimated around $16 million.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This particular derecho formed in South Dakota on the evening of Saturday, May 30th, and raced eastward at 70 mph across Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, before striking Michigan's Lower Peninsula around 4:30 am EDT Sunday morning, May 31st. The derecho event produced widespread 60 to 90 mph wind gusts, which caused extensive tree and structural damage and left over 861,000 homes and businesses without electricity across Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan). There were 4 storm-related fatalities reported in the state and 146 injuries (mostly minor). Statewide, approximately 250 homes were destroyed, 12,250 homes damaged, 34 businesses destroyed, and 829 businesses damaged. Damage estimates across the above listed counties totaled over $166 Million. 	NWS Storm Damage Field Studies suggested highest wind gusts in wet microbursts reached 120 to 130 mph in Spring Lake (Ottawa County) and Walker (Kent County), 100 mph in portions of Montcalm County (including Cody Lake and Stanton), 90 mph in Rockford (Kent County) and Zeeland (Ottawa County), and 80 mph in Big Rapids (Mecosta County), Ludington (Mason County), Sparta (Kent County), and northern Osceola County. On June 24th, President Clinton declared 13 Michigan counties federal disaster areas, including the following 10 from the NWSO Grand Rapids County Warning Area: Clinton, Gratiot, Ionia, Kent, Mason, Montcalm, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oceana, and Ottawa. It took up to 10 days to fully restore power to certain areas including the City of Walker and portions of Montcalm and Gratiot Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Michigan State Police EMD's Damage and Injury Assessment Report indicated $150,000 in public damage costs, another $150,000 in private property damage, 2000 homes damaged, 10 homes destroyed, and 10 businesses damaged. Two injuries were reported. Most of the significant damage was reported across the northern portion of the county including the cities of Belding, Muir, and Pewamo and the townships of Otisco, Orleans, Ronald, North Plains, and Lyons.

Thunderstorms fired up as warm air over ran the cooler air at the surface.  Storms formed over Nebraska and moved into western Iowa during the mid evening hours, then continued to advance east across the state.  For the most part the storms produced high winds with wind gusts to 70 MPH or more at times.  Winds gusted to 77 MPH west of Greenfield in Adair County.  There were numerous reports of trees and power lines downed.  One injury occurred in Union County as campers were overturned at Green Valley State Park by the high winds. Another injury occurred in Cass County when 65 to 80 MPH winds blew through.  Three semi-tractortrailers and one car were overturned by high winds in Interstate 80.   There were also many reports of farm sheds and buildings being damaged or destroyed by the winds.  Some building damage was reported in Creston.  A barn and farm shed was destroyed by high winds in Wayne County near Seymour.  Early in the storms development, a small tornado touched down in Cass County north of Anita.  The tornado destroyed several sheds and grain bins there.  In addition to the wind, there were numerous reports of marble size hail.  Hail was not a major event with these storms however.  The only large hail reports came early on in the event with golf ball size hail at Brayton in Audubon County, and one inch diameter hail reported in Cass County northwest of Atlantic.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A weak shortwave trough would interact with this boundary by late afternoon producing another outbreak of severe thunderstorms.  Capes the afternoon of the 21st exceeded 5000 J/kg thanks in part to surface dewpoints in the mid 70s and mid level cold air advection under the approaching mid level shortwave.  An east-west line of multicellular severe thunderstorms quickly developed along the front by late afternoon.  As the convectively generated cold pool deepened... a large outflow boundary developed and began to spread southward generating new convection along the leading edge.  Very heavy rain fell within this line of storms as they pushed slowly south as evidenced by reported rainfall amounts.  Many locations experienced wet microbursts within the stronger multicell storms.  Freezing level temperatures and wet bulb zero temperatures were quit high which greatly inhibited large hail formation.   The convective outflow weakened later that evening with echo training developing across central Indiana which went on to produce widespread flash flooding during the morning of July 22nd.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> ONE MAN ENDED UP PARALYZED WHEN A LARGE TREE LIMB FELL ONTO HIS CAR.

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's "gust front" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently "microbursts" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.  Overall, approximately twelve people sustained injuries and damage was estimated around $16 million.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Several areas in Champaign County sustained considerable damage caused by microbursts (100 to 110 mph) as the thunderstorms marched across the county.  Just south of Willard Airport, a mobile home was destroyed.  A woman inside the mobile home sustained minor injuries as the home was rolled off its foundation and disintegrated.  A nearby roofing business literally lost its roof.  In the same general area, two semis were blown over on I-57 with one driver sustaining minor injuries. Further south, just south of Tolono, 21 cars of a freight train were blown off the tracks.  No injuries were reported with that incident.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's "gust front" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently "microbursts" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.  Overall, approximately twelve people sustained injuries and damage was estimated around $16 million.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Initially, the surface warm front was located to the south of this system.  That was not actually the case aloft however.  During the predawn hours the surface front surged north and by sunrise was located across northeast Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable to the south of the front with dew point temperatures will in the 70s F.  The initial development of thunderstorms took place during the early part of the day over northeast Nebraska.  The storms became severe quickly as they moved and developed eastward into Iowa.  By mid morning, the storms had formed a nearly east to west line.  Storm relative inflow into the line was around 40 knots.  The storms produced a variety of severe weather across Iowa.  They initially moved east across the northern and central counties, but then began sinking sinking southeast.  The dominant severe weather with the storms was extremely high winds.  Damage was very widespread across the state.  Winds in excess of 100 MPH were reported with one unofficial wind speed measured at 126 MPH in the town of Washington at 1405 CST.  In one unusual story, high winds hit Mahaska County.  Three miles south of New Sharon, a puppy was tied to its dog house which was picked up by the wind.  The dog house and puppy were lifted over the top of a two car garage and a corn crib.  Both were deposited in the farm yard.  When found the dog house was upside down and the puppy, though scared, was fine.  There were several tornadoes during the event.  One of the longer track well defined tornadoes was the initial tornado.  It was on the ground for about 11 miles as it swept across Crawford County.  Several residences, outbuildings, grain bins, and trees were damaged along its path.  Reports indicate that between 30 and 50 residences were damaged by this tornado.  There were several small tornadoes in central Iowa.  They had short tracks and only touched down briefly.  One cut a mile long path east of Marshalltown through a corn field and a grove of trees.  Another in Dallas County was on the ground through mostly open country for two miles.  High winds were a major problem with these storms.  Many places reported winds over 80 MPH with incredible tree damage and numerous buildings damaged or destroyed.  At least 38 counties were declared disaster areas by the Federal Government due to the severe damage and flooding.  A final total will not be available before publication deadlines, however preliminary data have been included.  In the Des Moines County Warning Area these included:  Wright, Franklin, Butler, Bremer, Hamilton, Hardin, Grundy, Crawford, Carroll, Greene, Boone, Story, Marshall,  Audubon, Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Jasper, Cass, Adair, Madison, Warren, Marion, Adams, and Taylor.  One of the hardest hit Counties was Polk County.  Damage appeared to be from straight line winds based on a storm survey that was done following the event.  The damage occurred over the southwest semicircle of a large meso low in contact with the ground.  Due to the rapid translational speed of 50 to 75 MPH, winds were enhanced on the southwest semicircle of the meso low.  Smaller scale winds could have been embedded within this circulation as well.  There was little evidence of small scale convergent tornadic damage, however aerial surveys did make some suggestion and eye witness accounts of sightings were quite numerous in the metro Des Moines area.  All trees and debris were laid down to the south or southeast.  The major damage swath as 3 to 7 miles wide northwest of Camp Dodge, with a widening into a full blown derecho after that.  The event was born a few miles northwest of Perry, between Rippey and Berkley in southwest Boone County.  The mile wide damage path expanded to over 3 miles by the time it reached full intensity near highway 169 between Woodward and Perry.  The path continued through Granger, Camp Dodge, and Johnston.  The path was nearly 7 miles wide near Granger.  A second, smaller, meso low passed near Madrid, downing power lines.  This meso low matured near Jester Park Golf Course, causing significant structural damage to houses.  The two meso lows merged near the NWS Forecast Office in Johnston, with two miles of power poles snapped off between Johnston and Granger.  Much of the damage along the most severe track was in the F1 intensity category, with speeds in the 75 to 110 MPH range.  A few spots along the path, such as in the Granger and Camp Dodge area, sustained sufficient damage to justify F2 winds, 110 to 155 MPH.  It appears a tornado or family of tornadoes touched down southeast of Berkley and moved southeast into the Pleasant Hill area just east of Des Moines.  The track was intermittent, indicating either one tornado touching down occasionally, or one or more weak tornadoes rotating around the meso circulation.  The worst effected metro areas were the Granger area, Johnston, and the northeast side of Des Moines proper.  A duplex in Granger was flattened by the winds.  There were several reports of roofs being ripped off of stores and houses in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Several small private planes were flipped at a small air field north of Des Moines.  There were also several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being blown over on Interstate 35.  Heavy construction equipment was overturned on Interstate 35/80 just north of Des Moines.  Damage was extensive to the east side of Des Moines proper.  To make matters worse, following the passage of the main line of thunderstorms, a second line of severe thunderstorms developed and moved across the same areas already hit.  The storms were smaller, but did produce brief tornado touch downs and hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter.  The second line of storms did eventually combine with the first and moved southeast across the rest of the state.  Damage was widespread across the state and it will be months before final numbers are in.  Estimates from Polk County alone are near $100 million in damage including cleanup.  Totals were still being tallied at this writing, however a few include over $11 million in damage from initial claims in Johnston and $726,000 from West Des Moines just to city buildings and systems.  West Des Moines was on the far west edge of the major damage however.  In addition to the property damage, at least 125 people were injured during the storm.  Most of the injuries were caused by flying debris and many were not serious.  Fortunately there were no fatalities.  Heavy damage was reported by MidAmerica Energy.  On a state wide report, they indicated 200,000 homes  were without electricity, effecting over 500,000 people, at one time during the storm.  In the metropolitan Des Moines area, 100,000 homes were without electricity at the height of the storm.  That number was reduced to around 25,000 36 hours later.  The worst damaged areas were without power for 5 to 6 days.  Heavy damage was also reported by local telephone and cable systems.  In Polk County, the worst damage extended from the Camp Dodge area into the northeast parts of Des Moines.  At least 462 homes in the metro Des Moines area sustained significant damage.  Statewide, 80 homes were destroyed, 559 sustained severe damage, with 1416 others receiving moderate damage.  In the Camp Dodge area, 80 to 90 percent of the brick buildings were damaged with the roofs removed from many of them.  Lightning from the storms struck the WSR-88D in the midst of the storm.  The radar was taken out of service for more than 24 hours because of this.  In addition to the severe weather, flooding quickly became a problem.  Iowa soil was nearly saturated as the weather pattern had been very wet for six weeks previous.  Although rainfall was not extreme, one to three inches of rain fell over a several county area.  This caused widespread urban flooding across north central into central Iowa, though damage from the flooding was not serious.  Crop damage was very difficult to determine and will not likely be clear until the fall harvest.  Reports from some of the local extension agents say damage to the corn ranged up to 75% destroyed in areas with the highest wind, such as the swath that went through central Iowa in association with the tornado there.  No doubt losses will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not in the millions.   Accounts of damage were of course too numerous to document here as the areal extent of the storms was very large.  Countless reports of parts of crop fields being flattened were received.  Semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned by the high winds both in the Des Moines metro area as well as in Newton.  Trees were found on houses over a large part of the state.  One news reported wrote "there is not a power pole standing between Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa".  Though not figuratively true, this statement does point out the extensive damage that occurred with these storms.l<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

He was playing outdoors while his parents were clearing debris.  The limb was damaged during the storm and gave way.  The child suffered massive head injuries and died the next day.   Four roads were blocked by fallen trees in the township.  In Northern Bucks County, six major roadways were blocked by fallen trees in Nockamixon Township.  Downed trees blocked access to a few roads in Bridgeton Township.  Numerous power outages occurred in Erwinna, Kintnersville, Ottsville, Pipersville, Tinicum and Upper Black Eddy.  Farther south in Solebury Township damage was described as pretty extensive with many roads blocked by trees and wires.  In the Doylestown area six injuries occurred.  In New Britain Township, two people were injured when the trailer they occupied was blown into a tree at the Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa.  Tents were also damaged at the shrine.  In Buckingham Township, a woman was pinned under a fallen tree.  Another tree damaged a store.  In Doylestown itself, the brick facing of one home was torn down by the severe thunderstorm.  There were about 40 calls of downed trees and wires and at least one vehicle was crushed.  In Lower Bucks County trees and power lines were knocked down in Falls Township, Levittown, Middletown Township, Wrightstown Township and Yardley.  In Yardley, several large trees were knocked down.  They damaged a couple of vehicles, knocked off the gutters to one home and caused many detours.  In Middletown Township, a driver was uninjured when he drove into a downed tree on the road.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A 56-year-old man drowned in Sandy Hook Bay after his fishing boat rolled over.  About 30 persons were injured, mainly from hypothermia after their sailing vessels capsized mainly in Sandy Hook Bay.  The United States Coast Guard rescued about 60 persons from overturned boats.  Boats were described as being overturned left and right.  The 56-year-old man and his friend went fishing in a 14-foot-vessel.  They were about 500 to 600 yards north of Leonard State Marina near Atlantic Highlands when the squall line hit.  The boat apparently rolled over and the men were separated during the squall.  One managed to swim to shore, but the other gentleman perished.  In Sea Bright, lifeguards rescued persons hanging on to a capsized catamaran.  Almost every municipality at or near the shore reported downed trees and wires with some vehicles damaged.  Along the beaches umbrellas, chairs, towels, bags and boogie boards were tossed into the Atlantic.  Some of the worst damage included siding ripped from one home in Long Branch and the partial tear off of a Summit Bank's roof in Hazlet.  Wind damage was not confined to shore points either.  A wind gust to 75 mph was reported in Freehold.  The squall line also left a quarter mile wide strip of snapped poles in Millstone Township.     Service was suspended on New Jersey Transit's North Jersey Coast Line between Bay Head and Newark because of downed lines.

At least 22 tornadoes occurred throughout Oklahoma, of which seven were in northeast Oklahoma.  This outbreak of severe weather resulted as a powerful upper level storm system moved across the central plains and surface low pressure developed over southwest Oklahoma.  Warm humid air quickly invaded the area on the morning of October 4 and then collided with a cold front moving southward by evening.  The threat from these storms ran the full range of possibilities from destructive tornadoes to damaging winds to very large hail up to the size of baseballs.Numerous storms occurred on the evening of October 4, mainly north of Interstate 40.  The two most significant storms both moved eastward out of central Oklahoma.  One produced an F1 tornado that passed through Pawnee.  The other produced a 27-mile track F2 tornado that started in Okfuskee County and ended in Okmulgee County.  This second storm later went on to produce considerable hail and wind damage in the city of Okmulgee.  Many other thunderstorms developed during the evening in central Oklahoma, fanned by upper level winds in excess of 100 knots.  These storms moved into northeast Oklahoma, causing additional severe weather late in the evening that gradually spread eastward to the Arkansas state line.  After midnight, the storms congealed and became a slow-moving line of thunderstorms that sat over nearly the same area of northeast Oklahoma through the overnight hours.  The severe threat gradually diminished through the night, and flooding became the main problem.  For more information on the flooding, see the separate event entry for the flooding.  By late on the afternoon of October 5, the slow-moving line had moved into southeast Oklahoma and flared up during the heat of the afternoon, causing a few additional severe weather reports in the form of strong winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Two mobile homes were destroyed, and one home was damaged.

The result was the first severe weather outbreak across southern Wisconsin since May 16, 1999.  A series of upper level shorwaves contintued to move through the Great Lakes region during the remainder of the week into the weekend of  of June 12-13, 1999.  These shortwaves resulted in additional rounds of severe weather across southcentral and southeast Wisconsin. On June 6th, scattered severe storms eventually became orientated in short lines that produced 2 tornadoes, 10 gustnadoes (classified as thunderstorm wind damage), 3 funnel clouds, hail up to the size of golfballs, damaging straight-line downburst winds up to 80 mph, and isolated torrential rainfalls of around 1 inch within 20 to 30 minutes.  In Evansville (Rock Co.), 1/2 inch rain fell within 10 minutes along with large hail.  In addition, two people were injured by lightning strikes. Otherwise, numerous large trees and power lines were toppled by the powerful thunderstorm winds.A weak (F0) tornado briefly touched down on the northwest side of Lake Mills (the body of water), Jefferson County, uprooting and snapping large trees, but not causing any other damage.  Another weak (F1) tornado spun up just southwest of the intersection of Oakdale and Skyline roads northwest of Big Bend (Waukesha Co.), damaging 6 homes (one had major damage), and 2 pole sheds. This Waukesha tornado was on the ground for about 2/10 of a mile, and weakened after it crossed Oakdale Rd.  Most interestingly, the number of gustnadoes reported and verified was the greatest in recent memory. A couple of them were captured on video tape.   Several of them resulted in tree damage, and all ten were classified as thunderstorm wind damage.  Locations of gustnadoes were: 1) Rock county...Orfordville; Walworth County...3NW Darien, 1W Delevan, Millard, and 1NW East Troy; Waukesha County...3.5W Muckwonago, 1WNW North Prairie, and 2 of them 2SW Harland; Washington County...3SW West Bend on Little Cedar Lake.  The Little Cedar Lake gustnado actually spun up on the water surface (gustspout?!?!) and then moved onshore, damaging a pier and uprooting a couple trees before disspating.  It was observed by a trained spotter.  Another trained spotter found themselve briefly inside one of the gustnadoes southwest of Hartland!  The fact that so many gustnadoes were plainly visibile can be partially attributed to significant amounts of dust and dirt that were picked up off nearby farm fields. The was made possible by dry weather during the preceeding 3 weeks coupled with late planting (little vegetation) of some fields.  Other notable damage reports included: a motorhome was blown onto State Highway 14 near Evansville (Rock Co.), injuring two people; a home in Hebron (Jefferson Co.) was damaged by a wind-toppled tree, while northeast of Hebron a barn was damaged by fallen trees;  a pontoon boat was blown 500 feet near Elkhorn (Walworth Co.); a construction trailer west/northwest of North Prairie (Waukesha Co.) was rolled over and damaged by a gustnado; in Brookfield (Waukesha Co.) a construction trailer was damaged after strong thunderstorm winds flipped it over, while elsewhere in Brookfield a toppled tree damaged a home; in Germantown (Washington Co.)... a home had it gutters and shingles damaged while one of its windows was blown in; just west of Claladenio (Racine Co.) a truck was flipped over by strong thunderstorm winds, and a four block area on Milwaukee's west side suffered an intense wet microburst that damaged 14 homes, 17 vehicles, uprooted 100 trees, and knocked over a few power lines.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The characteristic of the severe storms, extremely rare for February, transformed from large hail to damaging winds as clusters changed into short lines of storms moving rapidly east/northeast at 43 knots (50 mph), or more.  All-time record February warmth (temperatures in the 60s) along with surface dewpoints in the 50s fueled the storms which also dumped rainfall amounts of 1/2 to 1 inch in 15 to 30 minutes.  Thanks to the intense rainfall rate and still frozen ground, urban flooding was reported in Dane (a mudslide was reported on the UW-Madison campus), Waukesha, and Milwaukee counties.  Hundreds of trees were uprooted. Probably 200 to 300 power poles toppled over due to powerful gusts to around 61 knots (70 mph), or were brought down by felled trees.  In southcentral Wisconsin, 16,000 customers were without electical power at one time or another, while about 4,000 customers in southeast Wisconsin lost power. Near Shullsburg (Lafayette Co.), the winds destroyed a corn crib and scattered its remains across State Hwy 11.  Also near Shullsburg, a large tree was pushed over on top of a pickup truck.  Large trees were also uprooted in the Albany to Brodhead area of Green County.  In Dane County, a wind damage swath extended from near Belleville northeast through southwest Madison to the east side of Madison around the Beltline.  Trees and powerlines were pushed over in this area.  The roof of a building on a golf driving range was ripped off, and sheet metal was torn off the siding of a couple other businesses in the Paoli area.  East of Madison near Cottage Grove, a semi was blown over, allowing 100 gallons of fuel to spill on I-94. In Janesville (Rock Co.), lightning struck a school building's chimney, resulting in damage, but luckily no fire.  In Jefferson County, wind damage was noted from Lake Mills to Watertown.  Besides many toppled trees, several construction sites in Watertown reported damage to scaffolding.  Tree damage was also noted just south of Palmyra.  In Walworth County, the powerful winds knocked over 2 construction trailers and 3 semi's near the village of Walworth. Large trees were also pushed over by the winds east/southeast of Whitwater. The southern part of the city of Milwaukee in Milwaukee County was raked by powerful winds. Many trees and power poles were pushed over.  A van was blown over, injuring two people.  Also in Milwaukee, a women was injured when the winds knocked her down. It was the nearly the same story in Cudahy which reported  damage to several homes, businesses, and vehicles.  In Racine County, the winds toppled trees and power lines in a swath from Rochester east to the city of Racine.  In the city of Racine, a man was injured when a large tree branch knocked him out of his wheel chair.  Wind damage in Waukesha County occurred in the area from Hartland to Pewaukee. Besides damage to trees and powerline, a shed in Pewaukee was destroyed. The shed's wind-driven debris then damaged a nearby car.  Further northwest in Dodge County, the powerful winds near Beaver Dam ripped off a barn's roof.  In Fond du Lac county, the winds toppled trees and power poles/lines from Fond du Lac northeast to Taycheedah.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

With sultry air in place, and favourable strong winds aloft, this front triggered the largest outbreak of severe weather in eastern New York since May 31st, 1998. A squall line developed around midday ahead of the front and produced the most damage. However, more thunderstorm cells  continued developing and some of  these became severe into the evening hours. Nearly every county in eastern New York experienced some  wind damage. Rensselaer, Warren, Washington,Herkimer, Saratoga and Schenectady Counties were especially hard -hit.  Powerful thunderstorms brought down trees and power lines in many  localities. Unfortunately, a falling tree killed a camper located on Uncas Island on Lake George.  Two other individuals  were injured as  they lost control of their car avoiding a falling tree at Diamond Point near Lake George.  Four  to five hundred trees were blown down in Putnam, Washington county. The wind peeled off roofs next to a toll booth located in Schenectady and downed trees crushed a car on Brandywine Avenue. Glenville in Schenectady county was described as a war zone with a large number of fallen trees.  A microburst  estimated at  80-90 mph downed hundreds of trees resulting in closed roads in Clifton Park, Saratoga County.  The worst damage was in the vicinity of Ashley Drive and Huckleberry Lane.  The swath was 1.6 miles long and fanned out 0.8 miles wide. Thunderstorm winds knocked trees onto a mobile home, crushing it, in the town of Halfmoon.  An even more destructive microburst with estimated winds of 100 mph, brought thousands of trees down between Raymertown and Pittstown, Rensselaer County, and tore roofs off storage buildings.  This microburst travelled 4.5 miles and damage fanned out to 2.2 miles wide. Another  microburst took place in Rensselaer, Rensselaer County, bringing a large number of trees down. In addition, roofs were peeled off  homes.  Lightning also struck several buildings in that town. One last microburst was discovered at Little Falls, Herkimer County. The wind with this one was clocked at 90 mph, bringing a large number of trees and power lines down in and around the town.  The wind also imploded a barn in Little Falls. A wind gust of 70 mph was measured in New Paltz, Ulster County. Shortly after the storm, an estimated 75,000 customers were without power in the immediate Capital Region.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the storms moved through Washington County trees were downed in Rohersville, a community 5 miles south of Boonesboro. The thunderstorm complex intensified rapidly as it moved into Frederick County around 1:45 PM EDT, and the northwest side of the city of Frederick took the brunt of the storm.  As the storm reached the Abbington Farms area a tornado developed.  The tornado was F1 strength with winds between 75 and 112 MPH and ranged from 50 to 200 yards wide as it travelled east for 3 miles.  The twister did extensive damage to trees as it moved through the communities of Eastview, Walnut Springs, Shookstown, and Fort Detrick.  Some  trees fell onto cars and houses, and a few homes under construction were damaged.  One home under construction in Walnut Ridge was torn to pieces by the tornado and the debris turned into airborne missles which heavily damaged two finished homes nearby.  Two homes in the Eastview subdivision were condemned after trees fell onto the structures.  A chimney was blown off a Willowdale Drive home.  Yellow Springs Road had to be closed for several hours until power and telephone poles blocking the road could be cleared.  A metal storage building on Rosemont Avenue was crumbled.  Part of the roof of the Food Lion grocery store on Rosemont Avenue was torn off and thrown toward the gates of Fort Detrick.

High winds also downed trees in Brunswick, leaving 100 customers without power.  As the area of thunderstorms moved across Montgomery County, large limbs were downed in Rockville and White Oak.  A lightning strike also damaged a home in Poolesville.  The bolt travelled through the electrical system of the home, shot flames out of an outlet and caught bedding on fire, resulting in $2500 in damage.  When the storms moved across Prince Georges County, winds in excess of 55 MPH downed trees from College Park to Hyattsville.  Tobacco crops in the southern half of the county were flattened.  Nearly 8,000 customers lost power in Prince Georges and Montgomery Counties. High winds also crossed Baltimore County.  Trees were downed from Cockeysville to Lutherville, and across the city of Baltimore.  About 18,000 Baltimore city and 11,500 Baltimore County customers lost power as a direct result of the storm.

The community of Silver Sands reported damage to roof trip, sheds, chimneys, and trees.  The path of the most intense winds was roughly two miles long and a half mile wide along Catherine Avenue and Duval Highway including Outing Avenue and 201st through 215th Streets.  Downed trees seriously damaged 5 homes and closed Duval Highway.  A young boy inside one home near Catherine Avenue received minor cuts after an 80 year old tree fell onto the structure.  The home was deemed a total loss by county officials and had to be torn down.  A brief power outage caused 100 sewage stations to send untreated water in Marley Creek. Lightning strikes and power surges also damaged home appliances across the county and started a garage fire in Glen Burnie.

The low tracked northeast and lifted into eastern Nebraska.  Ahead of the low, a strong low level jet of around 60 knots continued through the day.  A nearly stationary frontal boundary extended east from the low.  It lifted into southeast Nebraska during the day, but made little progress into southern Iowa.  Lines of thunderstorms formed along the boundary through the day and lifted north rapidly.  These storms were elevated in nature and as a result produced most of their severe weather in the form of hail.  As the day unfolded, a sharp dry line was clearly evident on the satellite as early as 1600 UTC across Kansas.  This line raced east during the day.  By afternoon, a speed max had rotated around the upper low to the southwest with wind speeds measured by the Lathrop wind profiler at 100 knots at 500 mb by mid afternoon.  Jet stream winds were in excess of 120 knots at the same time.  Combined with the dynamic situation mentioned above, considerable moisture convergence took place near the triple point between the warm front and the dry line.  Surface dew points pooled into to the mid 60s to even a few 70 degree F. dew point readings over northwest Missouri, southeast Nebraska, and southwest Iowa.  Meanwhile, dew points fell into the upper 20s over northeast Kansas and south central Nebraska behind the dry line, with teens over central and south central Kansas.  Thunderstorms erupted along the dry line by mid day and advanced east through the afternoon.  Low level helicity values topped out between 500 and 600 (m/s)**2 just before the first tornadoes formed.  Most of the storms in the warm sector became tornadic quickly.  The northern limit of the tornado tracks extended about 10 miles or so north of the warm front.  Tracks became intermittent very quickly as soon as the storms crossed the surface warm front due to the layer of very cold air just north of the front.  Surface temperatures on the cold side of the front were only in the upper 40s to mid 50s.   The entire day was very active.  Initially, warm air advection thunderstorms produced hail at many locations of central and northern Iowa.  Most of is was just below severe levels however.  The activity that developed during the afternoon was a combination of warm air advection and the approach of the dryline.  At the beginning of the event, the main weather feature was in the form of hail.  There were numerous reports of hail three quarters to one and three quarters inch in diameter.  The largest hail fell in Guthrie and Dallas Counties with reports of golf ball size hail.   One of the storms in the initial wave of afternoon activity became stronger as it moved into southern Story County.  Initially, high winds of 60 MPH or more swept through Sheldahl area of Boone County.  Greene County was also affected by high winds from the storms.  A tornado dropped out of the storm as it moved into the Slater area and was on the ground for about 2 miles.  Initial estimates showed 44 homes and businesses damaged in Story County, one was destroyed with major damage to another.  Thirty six homes and four businesses were damaged in the town of Slater.  Two people were injured during the passage of the tornado.  One of the injuries involved a 70 year old man who was picked up by the tornadoes winds and thrown about 10 feet before he latched on to something.  His shoulder was dislocated and he required 6 stitches due to his injuries in his hand.  High winds northeast of Slater knocked several cars of a Burlington Northern freight train off the tracks after they were blown more than one quarter mile down the track.  It was not possible to determine of the cars were knocked off by the tornado or high winds however.  This band of storms continue to race and develop northeast through the afternoon.  Damage became more sporadic, however high winds occurred as far northeast as Hardin County, with 70 MPH winds reported near New Providence.  Hail reports came in from as far northeast as Grundy and Black Hawk Counties, though it was only three quarters of an inch in diameter.  Attention then shifted to the tornadic storms that formed near the dry line.  During the afternoon, six more tornadoes touched down in Iowa, several of which were long track tornadoes.  The first touched down in Taylor County and tracked through Adams, Cass, and Adair Counties.  This tornado had was an F4 intensity tornado in parts of Adair and Adams Counties.  Damage was extensive with $1,000,000 damage reported in both Adams and Adair Counties.  Entire farmsteads were swept clean by the tornado.  At one time this tornado was a mile wide wedge with a damage path nearly two miles wide due to the circulation around the tornado.  Eyewitness reports indicated that the tornado split into two distinct tornadoes at times, similar to what occurred with the intense F4 tornado in Adair County of 27 May 1995.  One of the farmsteads hit near Nodaway was levelled.  Reports indicated that a check was blown from the house nearly 100 miles and was found in the town of Jefferson in Greene County.  Other checks and papers were found strewn along the path, stretching from Jefferson all the way back to northwest Taylor County.  In Adair County, one account indicated pieces of sheet metal from one farm was lifted and deposited six miles away from the farm.  Two people were injured by this tornado, one in Adams County with the other in Adair County.  One of the injuries Adair County was serious as a man suffered a broken back when the tornado lifted his semi-tractortrailer truck from the Interstate and threw it into a nearby field.  The other injuries from this tornado were minor enough that the people were taken to the hospital, treated, and released.  There was one account of a horse being picked up by the tornado.  It was lifted into the air and thrown through a stand of pine trees 40 feet high.  The horse suffered serious injuries and required significant medical attention do to lacerations.  The horse amazingly did survive against all odds, though was said would likely lose sight in one eye.  The next tornado touched down in Union County and tracked across Madison and Dallas Counties.  This tornado had an F4 strength in Union and decreased to a strong F2 in Madison Counties before intensifying again to near F3 strength as it headed into Dallas County.  Damage in Union County was around $2,000,000, and around $350,000 in Madison County.  There was one person injured by this tornado in Union County.  In an amazing account, the Union County Sheriff reported watching as the tornado lifted the car in front of him 35 feet in the air and throwing it 250 feet.  The driver was inside during this time and came out of the situation uninjured.  Five coal cars were knocked off the tracks in Union County by the tornado as well.  This tornado also had a double structure.  From eye witness accounts, which also can be shown on Doppler radar imagery, suggest a small rope like tornado passed through the Twelve Mile Lake area shortly before the passage of the main tornado.  The next tornado was a weak tornado which touched down about 4 miles west of downtown Des Moines.  The tornado did little damage, but did affect one house and several trees.  The tornado was seen by a local television sky camera.  A short time later, an F2 tornado touched down in Warren County and tracked into southeast Polk County.  The track was over rural areas and damage from it was relatively minor.  A more significant F3 tornado tracked from northern Lucas County, and weakened to an F2 as it moved across Warren, part of marion, and into Jasper County.  One house was destroyed in Lucas County with the four people inside sustaining minor injuries.  Once again, this tornado tracked across mostly rural areas, though it did hit a business and two homes in Jasper County and did $1,000,000 in damage.  One person was injured in Jasper County.  The last tornado touched down in Davis County at Bloomfield and tracked northeast into Wapello County with a maximum strength of F3.  Damage in Davis County was over $500,000 as 64 homes and businesses were damaged in the Bloomfield area.  To the northeast, the area of the tornado track was mostly rural and damage was limited to outbuildings for the most part.  One farmstead reported severe damage near Floris in Davis County.  The house was nearly levelled and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.  Parts of the house and outbuildings were found as  far as 5 miles away from the farmstead.  As the storms moved north, high winds were produced over Story County east of Story City.  High winds toppled a tractor semi-trailer truck east of Story City on Interstate 35, injuring the driver.  Two cars and a truck were also blown off Interstate 35 in Hamilton County.  Four people were injured.  Two were taken to the hospital, treated, and released.  Two were listed in serious condition, one with a neck fracture, the other with a shoulder fracture.  The later incident appeared to be from the rear flank downdraft behind the storm and not the initial gust front.  From the preliminary data, 178 homes and business were damaged or destroyed by the tornadic storms as well as countless outbuildings.  There were several reports of livestock loss as well.  It is truly amazing that there was no loss of life during this event and even more amazing is the fact that the injuries that did occur were all minor.  Twenty counties in Iowa experienced serious damage from the storms of the day.  Iowa Governor Vilsack declared several counties in Iowa disaster areas.  These included Taylor, Union, Adams, and Adair Counties.  High winds accompanied the storms as the moved through Appanoose County.  A local gas station recorded an 81 MPH wind gust as the storms cut a half mile wide swath of destruction west of Moravia.  There were numerous reports of cattle killed by the storms.  Some were killed by the tornadoes and flying debris, others by lightning.  Reports in Adair County, northwest of Fontanelle indicated about 25 head of cattle were struck by lightning shortly before a tornado moved through that area.  As the area of storms that produced the high winds north of Ames in central Iowa moved north, they lost their punch.  A few of the storms did remain quite strong however.  As the area of thunderstorms moved through Cerro Gordo County, high winds blew down a 60 foot corn crib and did some other damage on a farm near Rockwell.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Natural daytime heating and warm, humid air created very unstable conditions over most of the northeastern United States.  Isolated thunderstorms developed in western New York by late morning with several additional clusters moving into the Central Southern Tier by mid afternoon.  Scattered tree and powerline damage occurred in a swath from Steuben county eastward to Tioga County between 1:30 and 4:00 p.m. EDT.  Further intensification of the storms provided more widespread tree and power line damage around the Binghamton area where  60 mph winds  were estimated.

The training of thunderstorms in the northern line dropped extremely heavy rains across portions of northeast Iowa, with an unoffial rainfall total of 8 inches just north of Buchanan County.  The storms produced severe weather of nearly every type, including large hail (up to the size of golf balls in Fairbank in Buchanan County), damaging winds, funnel clouds, and flash flooding.  Although there were no confirmed tornadoes, it is believed that some of the thunderstorm wind damage was enhanced in some places by gustnado development along the leading edge of the squall line.  The most extensive wind damage (with at least 2 minor injuries) occurred in Cedar Rapids and Walker in Linn County.  Other hard-hit areas included Sigourney (Keokuk County), Washington and West Chester (Washington County),  Baldwin and Miles in Jackson County, and rural Jones County near Onslow and Wyoming.  Other reports of wind damage to trees and power lines came from Benton, Jones, Muscatine, and Johnson Counties.  The winds also derailed a train near Lowden in Cedar County.   After the widespread heavy rain, flash flooding soon developed, with the most extensive flash flooding from Buchanan county eastward across Delaware and Dubuque Counties into Jo Daviess County in Illinois.  The North Fork of the Maquoketa River surged quickly out of its banks, flooding portions of Dyersville (Dubuque County).  Much of Dubuque County also suffered major damage from flash flooding.  (See also Storm data entries for northwest Illinois for details on the damage in East Dubuque in Jo Daviess County Illinois.)By mid-morning on the 17th, the flash flooding had turned into extensive river flooding and then eventually became a record flood on the Wapsipinicon River.  See the following Flood entry for details.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Severe thunderstorm winds blew most of the roof off the MidAmerica Housing partnership building in northeast Cedar Rapids.  Debris from the roof was blown into other buildings and interior beams were pulled away from the structure.  Severe winds also blew two 18-wheel tractor-trailer trucks off Highway 380 near Center Point, causing minor injuries.   In addition, at least 20 power lines were downed in the Cedar Rapids area alone.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms along this line strengthened as they moved east, with several storms producing large hail, funnel clouds, damaging winds, flash flooding, and one confirmed tornado.The tornado (an F0) was spotted near Menominee in Jo Daviess County.  hail as large as golf balls fell in East Dubuque (also in Jo Daviess County).   Severe thunderstorm winds caused structural damage across portions of Stephenson, Whiteside, Carroll, Henry, and Bureau Counties.  The costliest and most dramatic damage, however, did not come from tornadoes or hail but rather from flash flooding.   Several inches of rain fell over portions of East Dubuque in only a few hours, causing a major flash flood in downtown.  Water flowed down a street and into the Mississippi River, ripping up pavement and washing away cars as it went.

Winds were estimated between 60 and 70 MPH in the community of Opal in Southern Fauquier County around 5:45 PM EDT and a wind gust of 60 MPH was reported at Sperryville in Rappahannock County at 5:20 PM EDT.  These severe winds downed trees and power lines in several locations of Rappahannock and Fauquier Counties, and in isolated locations in Prince William and Stafford Counties.  An observer in Opal reported 1.22 inches of rainfall in only 30 minutes as the storms passed through.  In the city of Waynesboro, a 42 year old woman was killed as winds from a passing thunderstorm toppled a 25 foot tall locust tree onto her as she was trying to free a pet from an outdoor kennel around 6:00 PM EDT.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> 48 year old woman killed by falling tree<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> .5K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Overnight the preceding night, the dry line aloft moved into Iowa, however the dry line at the surface lagged behind by a few hundred miles.  At sunrise, surface dew points were in the upper 60s to low 70s over western Iowa, while the dew point at 850 mb over Omaha had dropped to -8 degrees C.  Little eastward progress occurred during the day as a strong upper level disturbance began to lift north from the Texas Panhandle.  During the early afternoon skies cleared over western into central Iowa.  Temperatures warmed into the upper 80s to low 90s, while at the same time temperatures in the mid levels cooled several degrees C.  As a result, CAPE values were in excess of 4000 J/kg.  By late afternoon, Iowa was in the rear entrance region of an upper level jet streak.  Thunderstorms erupted as a result.  Actually there were two short lines of convection.  Both were oriented north-northeast to south-southwest and were moving northeast around 50 MPH.  Severe weather developed rapidly and was mainly in the form of high winds and hail.  There were several small tornadoes as well.  Reports indicate that most of the tornadoes were brief spin-up tornadoes or gustnadoes.  With the exception of two slightly stronger tornadoes, all of the tornadoes were very short lived F-0 tornadoes and produced little damage.  A couple of the tornadoes did turn out to be a bit stronger.  One in Webster County south of Otho was on the ground for a couple miles, while another was intermittently on the ground for over 10 miles in Franklin County.  All of the tornadoes were over rural areas and consequently did little damage.  Hail was very common with the storms as well.  There were numerous reports of hail from three quarters inch up to golf ball size.  One of the cells produced a two to three mile wide swath of one inch diameter hail across Kossuth County north of Algona, causing considerable crop damage.  In addition to the hail, many locations reported winds of 60 to 70 MPH.  High winds in Thornton lifted a steel grain bin and crushed it.  In Hancock County, high winds from one of the storms blew a semi-tractortrailer over south of Corwith.  The driver sustained minor injuries from broken glass.  Winds were common since the storms were moving about 50 MPH themselves.  Local law enforcement reported visibility reduced to under one half mile in blowing dust with several of the storms.  Winds around 60 MPH swept through the Gowrie area in Webster County for example.  Power was knocked out and many trees were toppled by the high winds.  A barn was nearly destroyed near Stratford in Hamilton County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The usual large hail and/or damaging thunderstorm wind reports were common (large trees knocked over), as well as isolated flash flooding or urban/small stream flooding. In addition, 3 people were injured in Elkhorn (Walworth Co.) when lightning struck nearby.  Torrential rains of 1 to 2 inches within 1 to 2 hours, on top of saturated soil, hit the Rock Springs to Leland area in Sauk County. A road near Leland was washed out by the flood waters.  Excessive rainfall also generated urban-type flooding in the Columbus (Columbia Co.) area in which water was 4 to 6 inches deep on some roads.   Just west of Beaver Dam (Dodge Co.), 2.5 inches of rain fell in only 45 minutes, resulting in urban-type flooding. Water levels on some roads ranged from 6 inches to 1 foot.  Flash flooding hit the south side of the city of Milwaukee (Milwaukee Co.) after 2 to 3 inches of rain fell within 1.5 hours. Several cars were reported to be "floating" down the streets and some were flipped over.  Urban/small stream flooding occurred north of Ladoga (Fond du Lac Co.) along and near Highway 26, after 1 to 2 inches fell in a 2 hour period.  Powerful downburst winds blew 2 cars and a semi-tractor trailer off Interstate 43 near Elkhorn (Walworth Co.).  Later on, powerful thunderstorm winds flipped yet another semi off Interstate 43 near Delavan (Walworth Co.). The driver was injured.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This cluster of storms started moving quickly east and formed into a large bow echo, a radar signature indicative of damaging winds.  Indeed, damaging winds swept across nearly all of eastern Oklahoma late on the evening of May 16 and early on the morning of May 17.  The apex of the bow, or the area of strongest winds, moved from near Okemah through Muskogee County and on to Westville.  While there were numerous reports of wind damage, Muskogee County saw the most serious damage, including several injuries when winds toppled mobile homes.  Marginally severe hail also accompanied this line of storms.After sunrise, another round of more widely scattered thunderstorms moved east out of central Oklahoma and moved across the eastern third of the state.  These storms produced more damaging winds and marginally severe hail.During the afternoon, an outflow boundary turned up stationary across southeast Oklahoma and was the focus for more thunderstorm development.  The afternoon storms mainly produced marginally severe hail.  In addition, the stationary movement of the outflow boundary allowed thunderstorm cells to train behind each other, leading to locally heavy rainfall.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Strong winds, likely in excess of 75 miles an hour, destroyed five mobile homes and damaged another six mobile homes in the Oktaha Mobile Home Park.  There were three injuries serious enough to warrant hospitalization.  At least three vehicles were crushed by homes knocked off their foundations.  Numerous trees were also blown down.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 165K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A 6 year old boy was killed near Linton in Greene county as a tree fell on him resulting in fatal head injuries. 2 other boys were injured as well as they took a glancing blow from the tree.  Meanwhile, a woman was injured as a tree fell on her car in Faribanks, and anorther woman was injured as thunderstorm winds blew her car off the road in Putnamville. A tree fell on a house in Vincennes causing $75,000 damage. Finally, lightning destroyed a house in Oolitic and injured a woman as debris struck her after lightning hit a circuit box. In general, wind gusts to near 70 mph across central Indiana caused numerous trees to fall across much of the CWA.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The winds also damaged several buildings.  In Sanbornton, a 60 foot pine tree fell on a car killing the driver.  An F2 tornado touched down in Pittsfield, moved through Barnstead, and then into Strafford before lifting off the ground, snapping and uprooting hundreds of trees, and damaging several homes.  In Lebanon, a 50 x 70 ft section of the City Hall's copper roof was peeled back by the wind.  In Hanover,  a portion of a roof at Dartmouth College was blown off by the wind.   In Claremont, the wind ripped the roof off a bandstand.  The wind left 80,000 customers without electrical service statewide.  Numerous trees were reported down in towns throughout the state and numerous roads throughout the state were closed.  The heavy rain that accompanied the thunderstorms caused some of the small rivers and streams to rise rapidly.  In Lincoln, two brothers swimming in the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River were swept away by the rapidly rising water;  one of the boys was bounced down the river for about a quarter mile before grabbing hold of a rock in the water.  A 14-tear-old boy was injured in Piermont when lightning struck nearby and entered the cabin through electrical wires.  Lightning also caused fires in several homes and buildings.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

For the fourth day in a row, temperatures soared well up into the 90s across the Bay State, along with high humidity.  The thunderstorms arrived in two lines:  one from mid-afternoon into early evening with winds clocked as high as 82 mph, and the second during the late evening with winds estimated  over 80 mph and large hail.  Damage was widespread from the east slopes of the Berkshires to the North and South Shore communities around Boston.  In the wake of the storms, tens of thousands of electric customers were left without power, and in some communities, it took several days for power to be restored.In Hampshire County, a 29-year old man was killed and two men were injured when a large tree branch fell on their car on Route 5 in Hatfield while returning home from a fishing trip.  Wind gusts as high as 65 mph were reported in North Hatfield as the storms passed.  There were countless reports of downed trees, wires, and telephone poles throughout western and central Massachusetts, where the most widespread damage occurred during mid to late afternoon.In eastern Massachusetts, the storms caused the most damage during the late afternoon and early evening when there were many reports of downed trees, tree limbs, and power lines.  In Middlesex County, wind gusts were estimated to be over 70 mph.  Several five to ten ton air conditioning units were blown off the roof of a building in Ashland, and part of the roof was torn off.  Large hail was reported throughout much of Norfolk and Plymouth Counties early in the evening.  Hailstones as large as baseballs fell in Brockton, covering Milton Street and damaging cars.  In Chatham, on Cape Cod, a 13-year old boy was lowering the sail on his small fiberglass sailboat on the shore of Oyster Pond when thunderstorm winds blew him and the boat about 200 yards into the middle of the pond.  The boy was not injured.  Later in the evening, the second round of severe thunderstorms caused more sporadic wind damage to trees and power lines.  The worst damage occurred in Weymouth, when a microburst caused extensive wind damage near Whitmans Pond.  A storm survey conducted the next day by the National Weather Service concluded wind speeds reached around 80 mph, which downed large trees, power lines, damaged homes, and made some roads impassable from fallen debris.  Damage was also noted farther south into Abington and Hanson.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several of the falling trees caused damage to houses and automobiles. At Beaver Island State Park, 12 people were injured when gust front winds downed a 35 foot tree onto a table of picnickers. Seven adults and five children, ranging in age from 5 to 35, were take to the  hospital. Most suffered cuts and bruises. Eleven were treated and released. One woman was held overnight with shoulder and upper back injuries. In Monroe County, at the Freeman Park in Mumford four people at a company picnic were injured when high winds picked up a tent and dragged it through the crowd.

Six tornadoes were confirmed, 5 of which occurred in west-central and southwest Oklahoma. There were also numerous reports of large hail and damaging straight-line winds. The first tornado developed in Noble County at 1545 CST and was witnessed by a member of the Noble County Sheriff's Department who said it developed a short distance southwest of the Cimarron Turnpike near Sooner Lake. The tornado then moved across the highway and quickly dissipated over the western edge of Sooner Lake. No damage was reported with this tornado (F0). The Butler Fire Department and 2 nearby homeowners witnessed the 2nd tornado, an F0, develop near Foss Lake in Custer County knocking down large tree limbs. Local media witnessed the 3rd tornado touching down about 8 miles southwest of Bloomington in Greer County near the Harmon/Greer County line. The tornado, an F1, tracked to the northeast for 7.5 miles, damaging barns, grain storage bins, and Quonset hut-type buildings. The 4th tornado, an F1, was witnessed by several people developing near the Greer/Beckham County border and tracking northeast for nearly 6 miles before dissipating about 2 miles southwest of Carter in Beckham County.  Damage was mainly confined to near US 283, near the beginning of the tornado path. Grain silos and a barn were damaged; an ostrich building was unroofed, and tractor windows were broken. Minor roof damage also occurred to a house. Little or no damage was observed in Beckham County. The 5th tornado, rated an F1, developed on the west side of Dill City in Washita County and ripped most of the roof off a well-constructed brick home. A storage shed in the neighbor's yard was destroyed, and numerous trees and power lines were downed. The 6th and last tornado was witnessed by a Custer County Sheriff's Deputy touching down briefly in a wheat field 2 miles north of Custer City, with no significant damage (F0).In addition to the tornadoes, baseball-size hail fell in Roger Mills County 8 miles south of Hammon. Several mobile homes were severely damaged. Two semis were blown over on Interstate 40 four miles west of Canute in Washita County near mile marker 42. Three people were treated for minor injuries. Power poles were also blown down in Canute, and in Butler, which is in Custer County. Numerous trees were blown down in Mountain View in Kiowa County, while minor roof damage occurred to several buildings on Monroe Ave. and Piedmont Rd. in Piedmont in Canadian County. Power poles, signs, and a barn were also damaged in Piedmont. In Kingfisher in Kingfisher County, 6 mobile homes were damaged in the Major Home Park; 3 barns and a chicken house were destroyed; numerous pine trees were downed; 3 pine trees were snapped behind Southside Auto; power was knocked out for 3 hours; extensive tree damage occurred in the park; a golf cart storage building sustained roof damage; portable corrals were blown over on Lemon Rd, and numerous billboard signs were blown down. A few homes were damaged, and a tree was downed in Perkins in Payne County. Also in Payne County, 8 miles southeast of Glencoe, 3 outbuildings and pick-up trailer were destroyed; a trampoline was blown away; trees were downed, and minor damage occurred to roof shingles. A metal barn and fence were destroyed, and 3 power poles were downed in Meeker in Lincoln County, while in Ponca City in Kay County a roof was blown off a building; 4 power poles were downed; and windows were broken on West Grand Ave. and North Second Street; numerous traffice signals were blown down, one onto a car, and numerous homes received minor roof damage. A woman also received minor injuries when she stepped on a piece of broken glass.Minor flooding occurred 2 miles northeast of Tonkawa in Kay County, where the intersection of Highway 70 and Highway 177 was flooded, and also in Ponca City, also in Kay County, where the intersection of Waverly and Hubbard was closed due to high water.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 30K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The low tracked northeast and lifted into eastern Nebraska.  Ahead of the low, a strong low level jet of around 60 knots continued through the day.  A nearly stationary frontal boundary extended east from the low.  It lifted into southeast Nebraska during the day, but made little progress into southern Iowa.  Lines of thunderstorms formed along the boundary through the day and lifted north rapidly.  These storms were elevated in nature and as a result produced most of their severe weather in the form of hail.  As the day unfolded, a sharp dry line was clearly evident on the satellite as early as 1600 UTC across Kansas.  This line raced east during the day.  By afternoon, a speed max had rotated around the upper low to the southwest with wind speeds measured by the Lathrop wind profiler at 100 knots at 500 mb by mid afternoon.  Jet stream winds were in excess of 120 knots at the same time.  Combined with the dynamic situation mentioned above, considerable moisture convergence took place near the triple point between the warm front and the dry line.  Surface dew points pooled into to the mid 60s to even a few 70 degree F. dew point readings over northwest Missouri, southeast Nebraska, and southwest Iowa.  Meanwhile, dew points fell into the upper 20s over northeast Kansas and south central Nebraska behind the dry line, with teens over central and south central Kansas.  Thunderstorms erupted along the dry line by mid day and advanced east through the afternoon.  Low level helicity values topped out between 500 and 600 (m/s)**2 just before the first tornadoes formed.  Most of the storms in the warm sector became tornadic quickly.  The northern limit of the tornado tracks extended about 10 miles or so north of the warm front.  Tracks became intermittent very quickly as soon as the storms crossed the surface warm front due to the layer of very cold air just north of the front.  Surface temperatures on the cold side of the front were only in the upper 40s to mid 50s.   The entire day was very active.  Initially, warm air advection thunderstorms produced hail at many locations of central and northern Iowa.  Most of is was just below severe levels however.  The activity that developed during the afternoon was a combination of warm air advection and the approach of the dryline.  At the beginning of the event, the main weather feature was in the form of hail.  There were numerous reports of hail three quarters to one and three quarters inch in diameter.  The largest hail fell in Guthrie and Dallas Counties with reports of golf ball size hail.   One of the storms in the initial wave of afternoon activity became stronger as it moved into southern Story County.  Initially, high winds of 60 MPH or more swept through Sheldahl area of Boone County.  Greene County was also affected by high winds from the storms.  A tornado dropped out of the storm as it moved into the Slater area and was on the ground for about 2 miles.  Initial estimates showed 44 homes and businesses damaged in Story County, one was destroyed with major damage to another.  Thirty six homes and four businesses were damaged in the town of Slater.  Two people were injured during the passage of the tornado.  One of the injuries involved a 70 year old man who was picked up by the tornadoes winds and thrown about 10 feet before he latched on to something.  His shoulder was dislocated and he required 6 stitches due to his injuries in his hand.  High winds northeast of Slater knocked several cars of a Burlington Northern freight train off the tracks after they were blown more than one quarter mile down the track.  It was not possible to determine of the cars were knocked off by the tornado or high winds however.  This band of storms continue to race and develop northeast through the afternoon.  Damage became more sporadic, however high winds occurred as far northeast as Hardin County, with 70 MPH winds reported near New Providence.  Hail reports came in from as far northeast as Grundy and Black Hawk Counties, though it was only three quarters of an inch in diameter.  Attention then shifted to the tornadic storms that formed near the dry line.  During the afternoon, six more tornadoes touched down in Iowa, several of which were long track tornadoes.  The first touched down in Taylor County and tracked through Adams, Cass, and Adair Counties.  This tornado had was an F4 intensity tornado in parts of Adair and Adams Counties.  Damage was extensive with $1,000,000 damage reported in both Adams and Adair Counties.  Entire farmsteads were swept clean by the tornado.  At one time this tornado was a mile wide wedge with a damage path nearly two miles wide due to the circulation around the tornado.  Eyewitness reports indicated that the tornado split into two distinct tornadoes at times, similar to what occurred with the intense F4 tornado in Adair County of 27 May 1995.  One of the farmsteads hit near Nodaway was levelled.  Reports indicated that a check was blown from the house nearly 100 miles and was found in the town of Jefferson in Greene County.  Other checks and papers were found strewn along the path, stretching from Jefferson all the way back to northwest Taylor County.  In Adair County, one account indicated pieces of sheet metal from one farm was lifted and deposited six miles away from the farm.  Two people were injured by this tornado, one in Adams County with the other in Adair County.  One of the injuries Adair County was serious as a man suffered a broken back when the tornado lifted his semi-tractortrailer truck from the Interstate and threw it into a nearby field.  The other injuries from this tornado were minor enough that the people were taken to the hospital, treated, and released.  There was one account of a horse being picked up by the tornado.  It was lifted into the air and thrown through a stand of pine trees 40 feet high.  The horse suffered serious injuries and required significant medical attention do to lacerations.  The horse amazingly did survive against all odds, though was said would likely lose sight in one eye.  The next tornado touched down in Union County and tracked across Madison and Dallas Counties.  This tornado had an F4 strength in Union and decreased to a strong F2 in Madison Counties before intensifying again to near F3 strength as it headed into Dallas County.  Damage in Union County was around $2,000,000, and around $350,000 in Madison County.  There was one person injured by this tornado in Union County.  In an amazing account, the Union County Sheriff reported watching as the tornado lifted the car in front of him 35 feet in the air and throwing it 250 feet.  The driver was inside during this time and came out of the situation uninjured.  Five coal cars were knocked off the tracks in Union County by the tornado as well.  This tornado also had a double structure.  From eye witness accounts, which also can be shown on Doppler radar imagery, suggest a small rope like tornado passed through the Twelve Mile Lake area shortly before the passage of the main tornado.  The next tornado was a weak tornado which touched down about 4 miles west of downtown Des Moines.  The tornado did little damage, but did affect one house and several trees.  The tornado was seen by a local television sky camera.  A short time later, an F2 tornado touched down in Warren County and tracked into southeast Polk County.  The track was over rural areas and damage from it was relatively minor.  A more significant F3 tornado tracked from northern Lucas County, and weakened to an F2 as it moved across Warren, part of marion, and into Jasper County.  One house was destroyed in Lucas County with the four people inside sustaining minor injuries.  Once again, this tornado tracked across mostly rural areas, though it did hit a business and two homes in Jasper County and did $1,000,000 in damage.  One person was injured in Jasper County.  The last tornado touched down in Davis County at Bloomfield and tracked northeast into Wapello County with a maximum strength of F3.  Damage in Davis County was over $500,000 as 64 homes and businesses were damaged in the Bloomfield area.  To the northeast, the area of the tornado track was mostly rural and damage was limited to outbuildings for the most part.  One farmstead reported severe damage near Floris in Davis County.  The house was nearly levelled and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.  Parts of the house and outbuildings were found as  far as 5 miles away from the farmstead.  As the storms moved north, high winds were produced over Story County east of Story City.  High winds toppled a tractor semi-trailer truck east of Story City on Interstate 35, injuring the driver.  Two cars and a truck were also blown off Interstate 35 in Hamilton County.  Four people were injured.  Two were taken to the hospital, treated, and released.  Two were listed in serious condition, one with a neck fracture, the other with a shoulder fracture.  The later incident appeared to be from the rear flank downdraft behind the storm and not the initial gust front.  From the preliminary data, 178 homes and business were damaged or destroyed by the tornadic storms as well as countless outbuildings.  There were several reports of livestock loss as well.  It is truly amazing that there was no loss of life during this event and even more amazing is the fact that the injuries that did occur were all minor.  Twenty counties in Iowa experienced serious damage from the storms of the day.  Iowa Governor Vilsack declared several counties in Iowa disaster areas.  These included Taylor, Union, Adams, and Adair Counties.  High winds accompanied the storms as the moved through Appanoose County.  A local gas station recorded an 81 MPH wind gust as the storms cut a half mile wide swath of destruction west of Moravia.  There were numerous reports of cattle killed by the storms.  Some were killed by the tornadoes and flying debris, others by lightning.  Reports in Adair County, northwest of Fontanelle indicated about 25 head of cattle were struck by lightning shortly before a tornado moved through that area.  As the area of storms that produced the high winds north of Ames in central Iowa moved north, they lost their punch.  A few of the storms did remain quite strong however.  As the area of thunderstorms moved through Cerro Gordo County, high winds blew down a 60 foot corn crib and did some other damage on a farm near Rockwell.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Although 7 tornadoes were confirmed across western Oklahoma, all on the 31st, only 2 of them caused damage. The most extensive damage during this severe weather outbreak was caused by straight-line winds and occurred across southern Kiowa and western Comanche Counties during the evening of the 31st. A very large swath of damaging straight-line winds developed on the west side of Tom Steed Lake in southern Kiowa County and expanded in coverage as it moved through all of southern Kiowa County, at times 10 to 15 miles wide. Power poles and power lines were downed, and a house received 2 broken windows and minor roof damage 3 miles west of Mountain Park. Power lines were downed 4 miles south of Roosevelt. Several trees were downed, and windows were broken at a lumber yard in Snyder, and power lines were reported down on Highway 183 between Snyder and Roosevelt. Major damage was also reported to wheat and cotton crop. Winds across southern Kiowa County were estimated between 80 and 100 mph. This 10-15 mile-wide area of damaging winds continued to move east out of southern Kiowa County and across much of western and central Comanche County. Winds were mostly in the 80 to 100 mph range, however in the Pecan Valley Subdivision located just outside of the northwest Lawton city limits, winds are believed to have reached 110 mph to 130 mph. As the thunderstorm winds spread east across Lawton and Fort Sill, they gradually decreased, but still caused tree, power line, and roof damage. In total, across Comanche County, 5 single family homes were destroyed; 4 single family homes under construction were destroyed; 58 single family homes and 8 businesses sustained major damage; and 150 single family homes sustained minor damage. Damage was estimated at 5 million dollars. Three injuries were also reported.The 1st tornado was reported by the Beckham County Emergency Manager doing no damage (F0) 9 miles south of Erick in Beckham County. The 2nd tornado was reported by a storm chaser 8 miles southeast of Erick in Beckham County and was captured on video. No damage was reported (F0). The 3rd tornado was witnessed by several persons and formed 3 miles southwest of Brinkman in Greer County, however no damage was observed (F0). The 4th tornado was reported by Greer County Emergency Management 3 miles south-southwest of Hester in Greer County. In Hester, a porch roof was ripped off from a house; house siding was blown off, and trees and power lines were downed. No damage was associated with the tornado as it moved into Jackson County and dissipated 1 mile southwest of Martha. This tornado was rated F1 in Greer County and F0 in Jackson County. Two storm chasers observed the 5th tornado as it formed in an open field, 5 miles northeast of Altus in Jackson County. No damage was reported (F0). The 6th tornado was captured on video as it formed about 1/2 mile south of Highway 19 near the North Red River in Kiowa County, or about 9 miles southwest of Roosevelt. Although this tornado was reported to be 1/4 of a mile wide, no structures or trees were affected, so it was rated F0. The last tornado, the 7th of the outbreak, was confirmed by a post-storm damage survey, performed by local law enforcement officials from Alfalfa County. They determined a weak tornado (F0), touched down 3 miles west of Jet. Trees were knocked down from 2 miles west of Jet to 1.5 miles north of Jet, while in a local cemetery, trees were downed, and marble headstones were moved 30 to 40 feet across the street.Straight-line winds were responsible for blowing over 5 aircraft and blowing off 11 hangar doors at Altus Municipal Airport in Jackson County. In addition, 2 barns near the airport were destroyed, and roof damage was reported to several buildings. Also in Jackson County, 1 vehicle sustained major damage in Blair, while several barns were destroyed. In Kiowa County, 3 campers were overturned, and several outbuilding were destroyed near Tom Steed Resorvoir, while in Mountain View, a small building was destroyed, and some tree damage was reported. In Stephens County, several power poles were downed in Duncan, and several trees and power lines were downed in Marlow. A shop was destroyed, and several trees were uprooted 3 miles east of Hunter in Garfield County; 2 power poles were blown down 2 miles north of Cherokee in Alfalfa County, and large tree limbs were downed in Rush Springs in Grady County. Hail to the size of softballs (4.5 inches in diameter) damaged hundreds of homes and vehicles in Alva in Woods County. Lightning struck the back of a 2-story residence in Enid in Garfield County, setting it on fire. Lightning also struck 2 oil tank batteries, 1.5 miles west of Rush Springs in Grady County, setting them on fire. Finally, flooding was reported across portions of Kiowa and Beckham Counties. In Beckham County, a road 2 miles southwest of Delhi was flooded by fast-moving, high water, while in Kiowa County, street flooding was reported in Roosevelt.Only a few reports of large hail occurred during the morning of June 1st, and the specifics can be accessed in June Storm Data.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The widespread effect and destruction wrought by these storms were unprecedented in Idaho; so was the tornadic outbreak as the line spawned five tornados.  The line took on a classic bow echo appearance as it charged east at 50 mph.  A mesonet established throughout the valley recorded an awesome straight line wind of 60 to 95 mph.  A new all time record for highest wind gust in Idaho was recorded at Minidoka at 96.3 mph!

Wind along I-15 near Blackfoot flipped 3 tractor trailers (1 injury) and forced a Greyhound bus (1 injury) into the median.  Poles for electric lines were downed wholesale.  Loss of power would idle 700 workers from potato processing plants and 350 workers from a flour mill for the remainder of the week.  In Moreland and in Shelley, both the elementary and high schools suffered roof damage.  A trailer home was destroyed and two more tipped over.  Scores of homes suffered minor roof damage.  Dozens of sheds and outbuildings were destroyed or damaged along with an airport hanger.  Innumerable trees, some over 60 years old, were toppled.

Several businesses sustained significant damage including an NTB store where the wind collapsed an exterior wall and threw roofing materials across Memorial Parkway.  A number of other businesses in the immediate area sustained damage, too.  Two people were apparently slightly injured as they sought shelter when the wind struck while eating at one of the restaurants that was damaged.

The wind damage extended up the west side of a ridge running north from Garth Mountain.  Significant damage ends near the top of the ridge.

The storms began in western Massachusetts during the late afternoon, with numerous reports of downed trees, wires, and large hail in Hampshire and Hampden Counties.  Hail as large as golf balls was reported in Granby.Northampton received the brunt of the storm damage, where a brief tornado and microburst caused extensive damage and one injury.  The tornado, rated F1 on the Fujita Scale with winds of 73 to 112 mph, touched down very briefly at 5 pm EDT in the higher elevations in Leeds, in the northwest section of Northampton.  A few minutes later, the same tornado briefly touched down again near Bridge Road in the Pine Brook Farm portion of Northampton.  The initial touchdown was only 15 yards wide at its maximum, about one half mile long, and lasted only one minute.  It began near Kennedy Road, just to the west of the southern portion of Roberts Meadow Reservoir.  It ended on the east side of the reservoir at Reservoir Road.  Convergent tree damage was noted in these areas.  The majority of the damage from this severe thunderstorm occurred from a very powerful microburst, with estimated winds between 90 and 105 mph, which affected the section of Northampton around Pine Brook Curve, Emily Lane, and Hatfield Street.  Straight line wind damage was observed in this area, with large trees snapped in the middle, and in some cases at their bases.  Four homes were declared uninhabitable due to large trees which had fell upon them.  Hundreds of trees were downed as well as power lines.  Hail, ranging in size from quarter to golf ball, accompanied this storm.  Amazingly, only one minor injury occurred.  A man was struck by a tree which fell into his kitchen, but was spared by his refrigerator, which acted as a shield according to several accounts.In central and eastern Massachusetts, thunderstorm winds downed trees, branches, and power lines throughout many communities in Worcester, Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Plymouth Counties.  Dime to nickel size hail also accompanied the storms.  At Logan International Airport in Boston, a wind gust to 62 mph was reported.About 15,000 electric customers lost power during the storms as they moved through Massachusetts.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms developed along and ahead of the front.  A number of these became severe, producing marginally severe hail.  The largest hail report was half-dollar sized in Clarkston.The storms produced a healthy amount of lightning.  A strike in Saline caused fire damage to a home there.  At Detroit Metro Airport, lightning struck the steel superstructure of a new terminal under construction.  Nine workers were injured when the bolt struck, and two required an overnight  hospital stay.At the tail end of the episode, a stray thunderstorm wind gust downed a large tree at Braeburn Golf Course in Salem.  The tree fell on a golfer, and he died of his injuries while being transported to the University of Michigan Hospital.The storms also produced quite a bit of rainfall.  The highest rainfall amount, 4 inches, was recorded in the city of Monroe.  Small creeks and streams, and urban areas, saw some flooding develop in the afternoon.  Flood waters lingered into the next morning, with some rutting of rural roads, and flooding of yards along the smaller creeks.  Minor river flooding also resulted over the next few days (see below).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms developed in the warm, humid air out ahead of the cold front.  A number of these became severe, producing the worst severe thunderstorm outbreak in metro Detroit in almost two years.  The thunderstorms took two forms on this day.  Widely scattered supercells developed across southeast Michigan, south of Interstate 69.  These rotating thunderstorms produced numerous funnel clouds, but no confirmed tornadoes.  However, some of these storms produced very large hail.  Hailstones as large as oranges were reported in Ypsilanti.  The Detroit Tiger baseball game at Comerica Park was interrupted by golfball sized hail.  The game was eventually rained/hailed out.  Golfball sized hail was also reported in Tecumseh and Plymouth.  Some sporadic wind damage also occurred with these storms, downing trees and power lines.  However, the stronger winds were to come later.A line of thunderstorms developed in northern Illinois and Indiana, and moved northeast at almost 70 mph.  This line of storms overtook the supercells as it moved into southeast Michigan, and produced widespread wind damage.  Some of the most significant damage follows:In Lenawee County: A barn was destroyed in Hudson.  Several vehicles were damaged by fallen trees in Morenci and Adrian.   Blissfield experienced some of the worst damage: a mobile home was flipped, injuring the two occupants (one of whom had broken ribs and a punctured lung); another man suffered electrical injuries when a falling power line struck him; an RV was overturned; store signs were destroyed; a garage collapsed; several homes were damaged by fallen trees, including one landmark home heavily damaged; at a local ball field, a scoreboard was destroyed, a dugout deroofed, and metal bleachers tossed; and large steel grain bins were destroyed.  A hangar at nearby Betz Airport collapsed, crushing an airplane.  Two other hangars were damaged.  In Sand Lake, a hay barn and a corral were blown down.  Tecumseh was also hard hit: a storage structure at a lumber yard was destroyed; part of an inn was deroofed; and numerous homes and vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.Dozens of trees were downed in Monroe County.  A spotter measured a 75 mph gust in Maybee, where a glass patio table was tossed from a porch to the back yard (without breaking!).  A trailer was blown over at a Dundee construction site, where a large tree damaged a car, home, and shed when it fell.  In Petersburg, a falling tree crushed an historic (over 150 year old) railroad depot.Wind damage was also widespread in Washtenaw County.  In Milan, a garage was blown down, and eight vehicles were struck by falling trees.  A grocery store in Ann Arbor had its front doors blown off.  Ypsilanti was hardest hit: several hundred trees were downed, damaging a home,  slicing a camper van in half, and crushing a garage and a car; a fire station was partially deroofed; and a church steeple was destroyed.In Wayne County: The west and southwest sides of the city of Detroit saw damage, with windows shattered, roofs peeled up, and chimneys knocked over.  At the intersection of Tireman and Rangoon, a car was flipped, injuring the two occupants; a nearby factory was deroofed, with a 13 year old boy injured by flying debris.  At Detroit Metro Airport, a 55 mph gust was measured; a Mesaba Airlines hangar was destroyed, and a plane inside was damaged.  Power poles were broken in Flat Rock.  In New Boston, store fronts were damaged, with many trees uprooted.  At Mettetal Airport near Plymouth, a plane was flipped.  Scores of trees were downed in Westland, damaging a truck and a home, and breaking windows.  In Redford, a falling tree destroyed a swimming pool and damaged a garage.  Woodhaven saw a garage destroyed and a second displaced; a warehouse roof was damaged; a home was deroofed; street signs were downed; and a wood board was embedded in the side of a house.  A school in Livonia had its air conditioning units blown over, and the walls of a connecting corridor were displaced.  Two homes in Dearborn were condemned after tree damage; another home was shifted off its foundation; a garage was destroyed; and a building was deroofed, with roofing debris damaging two nearby cars.  An outbuilding was demolished by falling trees in Sumpter Township.Oakland County was the other county that saw widespread damage.  A 64 mph wind gust occurred in White Lake.  Winds to 70 mph deroofed a trailer home in Highland.  In Milford, falling trees crushed a car and damaged a home.  Farmington saw a garage damaged by a tree, and phone poles were snapped.  In Novi, a trailer at a construction site was destroyed, with another trailer and a wall under construction sustaining damage; the air conditioning units on the roof of a business were ripped off.  Power poles were snapped in Auburn Hills.  Dozens of trees were downed in Pontiac, destroying a garage and damaging several homes.  In Bloomfield Township, a trampoline was destroyed, and a home was damaged by a falling tree.  Waterford saw an animal shelter destroyed, another damaged; over 150 trees were damaged; and a picnic pavilion was also damaged.Damage in the other counties was much less widespread, and was generally limited to tree limbs and power lines going down.  All told, over 200,000 people lost power at some point, and thousands of insurance claims were filed over the coming weeks.  Many schools were closed the next day due to damage or power outages; some schools and businesses did not reopen for several days.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 755K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several communities started their firework displays early in order to beat the storms; some were successful, some were not.  Dozens of trees were downed by the wind along Route 35 between Harrison and Naples; wind gusts in the area were measured at 84 mph.  Several homes and cars were damaged by falling trees.  Witnesses also observed a funnel cloud which formed over Long Lake.   In Otisfield, trees fell on the dining building  and a cabin at a children's peace camp, causing an estimated $25,000-$35,000 in damage.  In Bridgton, trees were reported down throughout the town, and a tree fell on a boy at Camp Wildwood; the boy was taken to a nearby hospital.  Trees were also reported down in Poland, Mechanic Falls, Topsham, Wiscasset, and in Union.  Statewide, Central Maine Power Company said that about 12,000 customers lost power from the storms.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Phillips and Rooks counties took the brunt of this mid-evening storm as losses in these two counties alone totaled in the millions.  The Long Island area of northern Phillips county sustained the most damage.  Winds of 100 mph hammered the area around 7 pm and hail covered the ground like snow.  Over 300 windows in this small town were broken and nearly every home in the town sustained some damage to windows, siding or the roof.  One person was injured as she and her family tried to run for cover from the storm.  The wind blew her across the kitchen of her home and into the dining room.  She sustained head, neck and leg injuries and was transferred to a hospital in Kearney, Nebraska.  The local grain company had seven grain bins and two unloading facilities demolished.  About 1200 customers lost power during the storm.  Wind gusts to 80 mph and hail the size of quarters were also reported in Agra and Logan.As the storm moved south into Rooks county, it spawned a brief tornado north of Webster Lake.  The funnel set down about 1 mile north of the reservoir but did little if any damage.  Just days earlier, outdoor warning devices were installed at the lake area and they were put into use to alert the public on this day.  Eighty mile an hour winds were common in Rooks county and resulted in up-rooted trees, downed power lines,  roof and building damage.  One truck was overturned on Highway 24 but the driver was uninjured.Crop damage was limited to the remaining wheat crop and some corn.  Fortunately, about 80 percent of the wheat crop had been harvested prior to the storm.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A complex of thunderstorms moved east across northern Michigan in the early morning hours.  Outflow from this thunderstorm complex moved south into southeast Michigan as a miniature cold front, and thunderstorms redeveloped along the leading edge of this outflow in the afternoon.  Meanwhile, thunderstorms also developed in northeast Indiana, along the edge of a deck of low clouds.  These separate areas of thunderstorms would merge over Metro Detroit in the late afternoon and early evening, producing tremendous amounts of rain.  Many places had seen heavy rain the day before, and thus the area was quite vulnerable to flooding.At Detroit Metro Airport, 3.71 inches of rain fell on the 11th.  This was the wettest September day ever in Detroit, and the 5th wettest day of all time.  This was on top of the 1.65 inches that fell the day before.  National Weather Service radar estimated around 5 inches of rain fell on the 11th in a swath from Brownstown Township to Allen Park in Wayne County.  In Washtenaw County, 2.26 inches of rain fell in Ann Arbor, after 1.32 inches the previous day.The storms had a broad impact.  Over 30,000 households were affected by power outages.  About one hundred flights out of Detroit Metro Airport were cancelled, and numerous people were stranded at the airport overnight due to the multitude of flooded roads in the area.  A collision on Interstate 94 in Harrison Township (Macomb County) during a downpour closed the highway for two hours.  Sewage overflows were common in Wayne County, as the water treatment system was quickly overwhelmed; the failure of some pumping operations due to power outages contributed to the sewer backup.  Several lawsuits were filed in connection with damage caused by raw sewage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tree was downed onto a car on Russell Avenue near Summit Street.

Thousands of large tree limbs and trees were downed smashing cars and homes. Some of the trees were 80 to 100 years old. A newspaper report said there were 1000 trees down in Highland Park alone. In Deerfield the hose tower roof was blown off the fire station. The police communications tower was bent in half at Highland Park. Over 100,000 customers were without power. Windows were blown out at the Allstate Insurance building in Northbrook. A wind gust to 84 mph was measured at the Palwaukee Airport in Wheeling (PWK) at 1542 CST.  The canopy at the Edens (I-94) toll plaza was damaged. State Police reported several cars had windows broken on the tollway near Lake-Cook Road. Also on the tollway, a pick-up truck with a 5th wheel trailer was overturned in Deerfield . On I-294, a van was overturned by winds and trees were uprooted near Willow Road.  A 69 year old man was killed when a tree fell on his car in Wilmette.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the 35 mile long line of thunderstorms moved southeast through Dane, northern Green, and Rock Counties, it increased in strength, ultimately producing straight-line winds estimated up to 100 knots (115 mph), heavy rains at a rate of 1 to 3 inches per hour, and hail stones 1 inch in diameter.  Due to downed power lines and poles, ultimately about 18,000 customers had electrical power disrupted for 1 to 2 days.  Descriptions of weather-related events follow in a county-by-county breakdown.Dane County:Powerful thunderstorm winds, estimated at 56 knots (65 mph), toppled several large trees in and near the city of Belleville. There were no reports of injuries or deaths. Minor urban-type flooding was noted due to intense rain accompanying the storm.Green County:The squall-line intensified as it clipped the northeast quarter of Green County. Based on inflicted damage, winds gusts were estimated to be 74 knots (85 mph).  The worst-hit area extended from a subdivision west of the village of Dayton (Town of Exeter), east/southeast to the county line.  About 50 homes sustained varying amounts of damage caused by felled trees, tree branches, or the wind outright. Damage to home siding and roofs was also noted.  Hundreds of trees were toppled, about 2 dozen farm buildings were damaged or destroyed, several silos were damaged, and two semi-tractor trailers were overturned.  Many power lines were either blown over or knocked down by tree debris.Rock County:This county bore the brunt of the storm as its straight-line winds intensified to an estimated 100 knots (115 mph). The macroburst damage path was 3 to 6 miles wide, extending from southwest of Evansville in the Town of Magnolia (Highway 59 and A) east/southeast through the city of Janesville to southeast of Avalon near Caver Roehl Park.  A newspaper headline nicely stated the effects:  Rain! Wind! Wow!  The powerful winds leveled thousands of trees (some 200 years old); tore roofs off homes; businesses, and farm buildings; blew tops of silos off, flipped over vehicles; blew in windows; damaged or peeled off home siding; knocked over billboards and road signs; closed many roads due to debris, and flattened corn and soybean fields.  Based on newspaper photographs and eyewitness accounts, maximum wind gusts were estimated to be in the 87 to 100 knots range (100 -115 mph).  The worst of the damage appeared to be equivalent to that caused by tornado winds of about 115 mph, or at the bottom of the F2 category.  Many people noted that the sky grew very dark as the storm blew in with a wall of white rain mixed with tree leaves and branches. The city of Janesville was at ground zero, as a 3.7 square mile looked like a bomb had hit its downtown area and the near east and west sides.  A roof was torn off one business, and bricks were pealed off another business.  It took at least 2 weeks to remove the tree debris from city streets, sidewalks, and backyards.  Dozens of vehicles were damaged by felled trees and branches.  It is estimated that 400 to 500 city homes sustained some degree of damage (6 destroyed).  Traxler and Bond Parks looked like disaster areas and were closed.  About 50 electrical poles were snapped by tree debris or the winds.  One person in the city was injured when a tree fell on their pickup truck.  Just north of Janesville on Interstate-90, another person was injured when their SUV was flipped over by the winds. In addition, 5 semi-tractor trailers were overturned on I-90 in the same vicinity. A new sub-division 3 miles south of Janesville experienced extensive roof or siding damage due to the winds or tree debris.  Several vehicles were damaged as well. Just to the south of the city, the wastewater treatment plant recorded 1.48 inches of rain as the storms moved through, resulting in urban flooding. There were other unofficial reports of 2 to 3 inches in the city area.The civil Town of Magnolia, in the western part of the county, was also hard hit by the macroburst, especially near and along Highway 59 and County Trunk Highway A.  About 40 power poles in this Town were toppled by the winds or tree debris.A little further north on Croft Road, just southwest of Evansville, a local resident noted this sequence of events: the initial, powerful winds and blinding rains lasted for about 5 minutes and were followed by hailstones up to 1 inch in diameter. Then the rain and hail stopped.  After a couple minutes he noticed across the road in a field a ground-based vortex pulling corn stalks up to about 200 feet above the ground, while above it at cloud base was a funnel cloud.  This weak vortex then hit a barn and caused slight damage before dissipating.  Shortly thereafter, another round of rain, and gusty, but much weaker winds occurred.  Based on this resident's account, and their prior experiences with tornadoes while living in Texas, this vortex was classified as a tornado. The macroburst continued to inflict wind damage to a point about 3 miles east/southeast of the Janesville city limits along Highway 14, at which point it weakened.  However, the thunderstorms briefly intensified once again southeast of the village of Avalon near Carver Roehl Park.  At this location, a barn's roof was lifted and dropped by powerful winds, resulting in a collapsed structure which trapped 40 steer.  Fifteen of the steer died from injuries, and some of the hay bales were destroyed.  Collectively across Rock County, about 4500 acres of corn and soybean crops were badly damaged or destroyed. Thirty-five farm buildings had minor damage, 8 had major damage, and 19 were destroyed by the winds. Walworth County:The remains of the squall-line generated downburst winds which leveled large trees in and near the city of East Troy.Racine County:The remains of the squall-line generated downburst winds which leveled large trees west of Waterford.Kenosha County:The remains of the squall-line generated downburst winds which leveled large trees southwest of the village of Twin Lakes.Milwaukee County:The remains of the thunderstorms dumped rain amounts of 2.25 to 3.1 inches across Milwaukee County based on Ham reports.  Moderate urban flooding resulted.  A West Allis motorist was rescued from their stalled vehicle due to water depths of 1.5 to 3 feet in low spots on roads.  Similar water depths on strees were noted elsewhere in the county, especially in the southern half.  No damage was reported. Synoptically, an upper level trough was moving across Wisconsin on August 5th, with a weak vorticity maxima over the southern part of the state moving east/southeast. The south winds of a low-level jet fed the storms as west-northwest flow at 18,000 feet intensified to 60 knots based on profiler data.  Thunderstorm echo tops were 40 to 42,000 feet.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms developed in the warm, humid air out ahead of the cold front.  A number of these became severe, producing the worst severe thunderstorm outbreak in metro Detroit in almost two years.  The thunderstorms took two forms on this day.  Widely scattered supercells developed across southeast Michigan, south of Interstate 69.  These rotating thunderstorms produced numerous funnel clouds, but no confirmed tornadoes.  However, some of these storms produced very large hail.  Hailstones as large as oranges were reported in Ypsilanti.  The Detroit Tiger baseball game at Comerica Park was interrupted by golfball sized hail.  The game was eventually rained/hailed out.  Golfball sized hail was also reported in Tecumseh and Plymouth.  Some sporadic wind damage also occurred with these storms, downing trees and power lines.  However, the stronger winds were to come later.A line of thunderstorms developed in northern Illinois and Indiana, and moved northeast at almost 70 mph.  This line of storms overtook the supercells as it moved into southeast Michigan, and produced widespread wind damage.  Some of the most significant damage follows:In Lenawee County: A barn was destroyed in Hudson.  Several vehicles were damaged by fallen trees in Morenci and Adrian.   Blissfield experienced some of the worst damage: a mobile home was flipped, injuring the two occupants (one of whom had broken ribs and a punctured lung); another man suffered electrical injuries when a falling power line struck him; an RV was overturned; store signs were destroyed; a garage collapsed; several homes were damaged by fallen trees, including one landmark home heavily damaged; at a local ball field, a scoreboard was destroyed, a dugout deroofed, and metal bleachers tossed; and large steel grain bins were destroyed.  A hangar at nearby Betz Airport collapsed, crushing an airplane.  Two other hangars were damaged.  In Sand Lake, a hay barn and a corral were blown down.  Tecumseh was also hard hit: a storage structure at a lumber yard was destroyed; part of an inn was deroofed; and numerous homes and vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.Dozens of trees were downed in Monroe County.  A spotter measured a 75 mph gust in Maybee, where a glass patio table was tossed from a porch to the back yard (without breaking!).  A trailer was blown over at a Dundee construction site, where a large tree damaged a car, home, and shed when it fell.  In Petersburg, a falling tree crushed an historic (over 150 year old) railroad depot.Wind damage was also widespread in Washtenaw County.  In Milan, a garage was blown down, and eight vehicles were struck by falling trees.  A grocery store in Ann Arbor had its front doors blown off.  Ypsilanti was hardest hit: several hundred trees were downed, damaging a home,  slicing a camper van in half, and crushing a garage and a car; a fire station was partially deroofed; and a church steeple was destroyed.In Wayne County: The west and southwest sides of the city of Detroit saw damage, with windows shattered, roofs peeled up, and chimneys knocked over.  At the intersection of Tireman and Rangoon, a car was flipped, injuring the two occupants; a nearby factory was deroofed, with a 13 year old boy injured by flying debris.  At Detroit Metro Airport, a 55 mph gust was measured; a Mesaba Airlines hangar was destroyed, and a plane inside was damaged.  Power poles were broken in Flat Rock.  In New Boston, store fronts were damaged, with many trees uprooted.  At Mettetal Airport near Plymouth, a plane was flipped.  Scores of trees were downed in Westland, damaging a truck and a home, and breaking windows.  In Redford, a falling tree destroyed a swimming pool and damaged a garage.  Woodhaven saw a garage destroyed and a second displaced; a warehouse roof was damaged; a home was deroofed; street signs were downed; and a wood board was embedded in the side of a house.  A school in Livonia had its air conditioning units blown over, and the walls of a connecting corridor were displaced.  Two homes in Dearborn were condemned after tree damage; another home was shifted off its foundation; a garage was destroyed; and a building was deroofed, with roofing debris damaging two nearby cars.  An outbuilding was demolished by falling trees in Sumpter Township.Oakland County was the other county that saw widespread damage.  A 64 mph wind gust occurred in White Lake.  Winds to 70 mph deroofed a trailer home in Highland.  In Milford, falling trees crushed a car and damaged a home.  Farmington saw a garage damaged by a tree, and phone poles were snapped.  In Novi, a trailer at a construction site was destroyed, with another trailer and a wall under construction sustaining damage; the air conditioning units on the roof of a business were ripped off.  Power poles were snapped in Auburn Hills.  Dozens of trees were downed in Pontiac, destroying a garage and damaging several homes.  In Bloomfield Township, a trampoline was destroyed, and a home was damaged by a falling tree.  Waterford saw an animal shelter destroyed, another damaged; over 150 trees were damaged; and a picnic pavilion was also damaged.Damage in the other counties was much less widespread, and was generally limited to tree limbs and power lines going down.  All told, over 200,000 people lost power at some point, and thousands of insurance claims were filed over the coming weeks.  Many schools were closed the next day due to damage or power outages; some schools and businesses did not reopen for several days.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 960K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several storms produced winds in excess of 55 MPH, large hail, frequent lightning, and very heavy downpours.  One storm produced a 4 mile long F1 tornado on the north side of Charlottesville.  At 7:45 PM a tornado touched down about 2 miles west of Charlottesville on the north side of Farmington Country Club and downed several trees.  It moved northeast across Barracks Road to Albemarle High School where it took insulation from underneath modular classrooms and splattered it along nearby walls.  The storm then crossed Hydraulic Road and Route 29 near Albemarle Square Shopping Center where it blew out a plate-glass window, injuring one customer. The tornado moved into the Woodbrook neighborhood where it damaged a few homes and trees then dissipated around 7:55 PM EDT.  Hundreds of trees in the path of this 300 yard wide tornado were downed or snapped.  The hardest hit areas were along Route 250 and Owensville Road, including the neighborhoods of Farmington, West Leigh, and Glenaire.  Just south of the tornado's path, straight line winds estimated between 80 and 100 MPH downed several trees, power lines, and telephone poles.

Wind gusts were estimated to reach 80 mph in the strongest part of the storm that went through Lawrence Township. About 75 large trees were completely uprooted. Three persons were injured. The worst damage within Lawrence Township occurred on U.S. Route 206, Province Line, Carter, Rosedale and Carson Roads. Carter Road was closed for over 24 hours because of the downed trees and five snapped poles. A large tree crashed into the bedroom of a house on U.S. Route 206 next to Peterson's Nursery. A 92-year-old barely escaped serious injury. In the nursery itself, 30 trees were uprooted and a gazebo was lifted and splintered. Two volunteer fire-fighters were injured by a fallen limb while responding to an emergency call. Elsewhere within the township, a chimney was knocked down on Lawrenceville Road, another tree landed on a house on Tall Timbers Drive and the front door and garage of another home were completely blocked by downed trees.  The Bristol-Myers Squibb Lawrence Campus suffered considerable wind damage to their trees, especially the willows. At least three vehicle were crushed by fallen trees.  In Princeton Township, U.S. Route 206 was blocked by fallen trees for a day. Several trees were also knocked down in Clarksville (West Windsor Township). Large hail also fell in Lawrence and Princeton Townships and shredded vegetation. The hail reached golf ball size in Princeton Township. In Lawrence Township, the hail piled into small drifts. PSE&G reported about 11,000 homes and businesses lost power in the county.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The difference in pressure between these systems caused increasing south winds.  As an intensifying cold front trailing from the low approached the area with abundant low level moisture in place, widespread rain with embedded thunderstorms occurred.  Heavy rain caused significant flooding at several locations.  Heavy showers, some associated with severe thunderstorms, produced wind damage at several locations.Here are selected wind damage reports and measured peak wind gusts:In Passaic County, high winds downed trees that fell on a car which injured 2 occupants in Clifton.In Bergen County, trees were downed in Ramsey.  The peak wind gust measured by the Automated Surface Observing System at Teterboro Airport was 41 mph at 10:27 am.In Essex County, numerous trees were downed in West Caldwell, Caldwell, Essex Fells, Maplewood and Nutley.  The peak wind gust measured by the Automated Surface Observing System at Newark Airport was 51 mph at 10:50 pm.In Hudson County, trees were downed in Kearney and two sections of Harrison.  The peak wind gust measured by spotter equipment at Harrison was 47 mph at 11:00 am.In Union County, trees were downed in Plainfield, Hillside, and Union.  Telephone poles were also downed across part of Route 22 in Union.  The peak wind gust measured by spotter equipment at Elizabeth was 53 mph.The heaviest rain occurred in bands oriented from southwest to northeast ahead of the approaching cold front.  The axis of the heaviest rain extended from Western Union County northeast across Western Essex, Central Passaic, and Western Bergen Counties, where 2 to 3 inches of rain fell with isolated amounts up to 3 1/2 inches.  Flooding of low-lying poor drainage areas and streams occurred.Here are selected rainfall amounts and flood damage reports:In Passaic County, rainfall amounts ranged from 2.20 inches at West Patterson to 3.11 inches at Charlottesburg.In Bergen County, rainfall amounts ranged from 1.32 inches at New Milford to 2.91 inches at Franklin Lakes.  Flooding was reported in Oakland and the Saddle River in Lodi was near bankfull at 11:29 am.In Essex County, rainfall amounts ranged from 1.38 inches at Maplewood to 2.60 inches at Essex Fells.  Flooding occurred along parts of the JFK Parkway in Millburn.  The Peckman River at Verona crest stage was 4.60 feet at 1:00 pm, which was 1.1 feet above its' flood stage of 3.5 feet.In Union County, rainfall amounts ranged from 2.10 inches at Cranford to 2.48 inches at Mountainside.  Urban flooding of low-lying poor drainage areas was reported in Elizabeth and Union.  The Rahway River at Springfield was above its' flood stage of 5.5 feet from 12:15 pm through 5:30 pm.

Thunderstorm winds blew down trees and power lines in Frankfort, Herkimer county. More trees were blown down at Fort Plain, Canajoharie and St. Johnsville, all in Montgomery county. Trees and wires were knocked down at Caroga Lake in Fulton county. Trees fell in Charlottesville, Schoharie county. In Schenectady county, trees were reported blown over in both Duanesburg and the city of Schenectady. Numerous trees fell in Rensselaerville and areas  just  to  the north, in Albany county. By far, the most concentrated and severe damage took place at Ballston Spa in Saratoga county. A strong microburst, with winds estimated between 75 and 100  miles-an-hour, covered a swath 75 yards wide and 500 yards long. The microburst went through the Curtis Lumber facility. Winds destroyed a portion of the barn structure, scattering heavy lumber across the yard and removing roofing. The wind drove a piece of the roof  through the cab of a parked truck cab, impaling the truck driver's left leg, and critically injuring him. He had to be removed from the vehicle by the Jaws of Life. Another passenger in the cab sustained superfiical injuries. Another nearby truck also sustained damage. An executive at Curtis Lumber reported spotting a funnel cloud, which was likely a minor vortex, spun up by downburst action. The official National Weather Service survey found no evidence of tornadic damage. The damage was in a large fan pattern consistant with an intense microburst. More trees fell in nearby in Ballston Spa and Galway. 	Another microburst hit the Town of  Jackson, in Washington County, knocking over an estimated 1000 trees. Also in Washington county, trees were blown down at Fort Edward.  	There was one significant hail report with the storms. Nickel size hail was reported at Warrensburg in Warren County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Massive downburst winds estimated at 90 to 110 mph hit areas from eight miles west of Spearfish to several miles east of Spearfish. Hail to golfball size accompanied the high winds and damaged roofs and siding throughout the region, although the winds caused the worst damage. In town, the intense winds shattered signs, blew over gas station awnings and the wind driven hail caused major damage to automotive and mobile home dealerships.  A retirement home had a quarter of its roof torn off and a hotel had to evacuate all its guests as a portion of their roof was blown off. At least ten mobile homes were unlivable, and over 100 mobile homes had damage to siding, roofing and skirting. The airport at Spearfish had 27 planes damaged, and seven of those were destroyed beyond repair.  Seven hangers at the airport were also damaged or destroyed. A massive amount of trees in Spearfish were either snapped in half or completely knocked over, leaving many roads unpassable after the event.  Roofing material sliced through an oxygen valve at the Spearfish Trout Farm and killed 100,000 out of 120,000 trout that the family raised.  In the Spearfish city campground, more then 150 campers were there, in anticipation of the 60th Annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally the following week.  Over 100 trees were blown over and many people had camping equipment, vehicles or motorcycles damaged by the falling trees. None of the trees fell on  occupied tents, although several fell within inches of where people were sleeping in their tents. 4 injuries were reported.  One of the injuries required treatment at Rapid City Medical Center after someone was injured when his camper flipped over on the interstate. East of Spearfish, highway signs were blown over, large round bales of hay were blown several yards, and more trees were blown down or snapped off.  Numerous outbuildings were also damaged, with debris scattered nearly a hundred yards downstream.  In Sturgis, the damage was not as intense.  The majority of the damage occurred to tents that were set up by vendors selling merchandise for the motorcycle rally. The most critical injury from the entire event occurred in Sturgis when a vendor was trying to keep his tent from being blown away, and he was thrown into metal scaffolding.  He was treated at the Rapid City Regional Hospital.  As the storm moved to the southeast, high winds over 60 mph were reported for nearly 45 minuted between Sturgis and Rapid City.  In Rapid City, the National Weather Service office measured wind gusts of 70 mph.  The only damage reported were tree limbs down. The storm weakened as it moved southeast of Rapid City, but was still at severe limits as it passed over the Badlands National Park and went southward into Bennett County.  Observers in Martin reported 60 mph wind gusts. The storm dissipated before reaching Nebraska.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 9.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

They produced one F1 tornado, one funnel cloud, and high winds that downed many trees and power lines and caused at least 11 injuries, 8 of which were in New York City.Based on a storm survey performed by NWS staff, an F1 tornado occurred around 7:05 pm EDT in the continental village region of the town of Cortlandt, about 3 miles north of Peekskill on the Westchester and Putnam Counties border.  The tornado was classified as an F1 based on tree damage and their associated patterns.  Touch down was on the southwest corner of the intersection of Highland Drive and Heath Terrace.  The tornado moved northeast along the southeast shore of Cortlandt Lake in a counter-clockwise arched pattern lifting just south of the intersection of Schuyler Lane and Putnam Road.  The Path Length was about 0.3 miles and Path Width averaged 33 yards.  In the vicinity of Tyron Circle and Putnam Road, the tornado was at its' widest and strongest.  Damage occurred to about 20 houses, with 7 houses incurring moderate damage.  The tornado apparently reformed in 2 other locations as the severe thunderstorm moved east:  Sprout Brook Road (Path Length about 0.15 miles) and Lakeview Road (Path Length just less than 0.1 miles).  Numerous trees of 1 1/2 to 2 feet in diameter were snapped, mainly about 20 to 25 feet above the ground.  Three telephone poles were snapped in the middle.  Meteorologically, this tornado formed on the roll of a gust front that moved nearly 50 mph across the region and was likely on the ground for less than 1 minute.Here's a brief summary of damage reports received:In Orange County, a 60 mph wind gust was reported at the Plattekill Service Area along the NYS Thruway, just north of Leptondale.

It was noted that the downed pine timber in the Little River State Park possessed some of the largest known diameters of any of the downed trees in the 3/12/01 severe weather outbreak that occurred over Southwest Alabama.   A Park Ranger was severely injured when the vehicle he was in was crushed by one of the falling trees.  The same line of storms produced wind damage to structures, and 1 inch hail in Huxford, which is just north of the State Park.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The cold front from the previous storm did not move all that far to the south of Iowa.  As a result, warm and moist air was able to move north into Iowa rapidly.  A warm front lifted into southern Iowa during the late afternoon hours, sending temperatures into the 80s over parts of southern Iowa.  Dew point temperatures jumped into the low to mid 60s.  The atmosphere became very unstable with thunderstorms developing along the front.  Most of the storms were associated with the warm front itself,  though  a mesoscale feature moved along the front setting the stage for an additional like of thunderstorms that developed north to south in south central Iowa.  The main feature with the storms was hail.  There were numerous reports of hail ranging from nickel size up to golf ball size.  Several of the storms had well developed meso circulations associated with them.  A few tornadoes resulted.  Two of the tornadoes were very small and only touched down briefly in Tama and Dallas Counties.  The other tornadoes were stronger.  One tornado touched down in Decatur County near Leon.  Two people were injured, one requiring hospitalization, as a mobile home was overturned by the gust front ahead of the storm itself.  The second of the stronger tornadoes moved through Adams County.  A trailer house was overturned and the roofs were removed from two sheds on a farm northeast of Mt. Etna.  Thunderstorms produced very heavy rainfall of one to two inches per hour over Ringgold County.  Total rainfall approached 4 inches in less than 3 hours as storms repeatedly moved across the same areas.  The rain caused flash flooding in the county.  In one instance, Lotts Creek overtopped a road southeast of Mt. Ayr, causing nearly $50,000 in damage as the road washed out.   As the storms moved through Decatur County, lightning stuck a house in Garde Grove.  The house was set on fire, but it was not detected for several hours after the lightning strike.  The house was destroyed and completely burned to the ground.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The wind storm moved into western Alabama around 141 PM and exited the eastern counties around 438 PM.  Wind gusts were estimated between 60 and 105 miles an hour during the event and these gusts produced extensive wind damage throughout the entire area, similar to F0 and F1 tornado damage.  The American Red Cross estimated that at least 2500 homes were damaged and some destroyed.  Major electrical transmission lines were down in Tuscaloosa and Fayette Counties.  Alabama Power estimated that at least 400,000 homes and businesses were initially without power, which is one third of their total customers.  According to Alabama Power, this event ranked as the third highest ever for power outages in the state of Alabama.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Tuscaloosa County reported numerous trees and power lines blown down countywide.  Many of the fallen trees caused roads to be closed temporarily.  Numerous homes were damaged.  Wind gusts of 80 mph were measured in Northport and the Tuscaloosa Airport had 60 mph winds.  Numerous funnel cloud reports were received throughout the county.  One man was injured when a tree fell on his automobile on Highway 43.  One 18-wheel truck was overturned on a bridge over the Black Warrior River.  Several businesses reported broken windows.  One firefighter was injured in Northport when a tree fell on him.  This event occurred as the firefighter was cleaning up debris.  Quarter size hail was also reported with these storms.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The resulting  thunderstorm winds were measured at between 50 and 60 knots, with estimates of gusts at times near 80 knots.  These winds, at time accompanied by very large hail,  damaged the roofs of homes and blew down power lines between Round Rock and Pfleugerville.   The large hail further damaged homes and broke windows in houses and vehicles.  Nearly 300 mobile homes were damaged by the winds.  Damage was also reported to the doors of a large theater complex in Pfleugerville.

Damage was noted first in the Samples community with a few trees downed along Highway 365. The damage became a little more widespread farther southeast in White Hall. There, more trees were knocked down with several buildings sustaining roof damage. Farther southeast in Dollarway, roof damage occurred at several homes and businesses with billboards blown down. Windows were also blown out of a few homes and businesses, with a trailer completely destroyed when a large tree fell through it. Two people were injured in the trailer. Finally, in Pine Bluff, numerous trees fell on homes and apartment buildings, causing severe structural damage. Some buildings in the downtown area had portions of their brick exteriors collapse, with windows blown out as well. One person sustained minor injuries at a local rail yard.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The cold front from the previous storm did not move all that far to the south of Iowa.  As a result, warm and moist air was able to move north into Iowa rapidly.  A warm front lifted into southern Iowa during the late afternoon hours, sending temperatures into the 80s over parts of southern Iowa.  Dew point temperatures jumped into the low to mid 60s.  The atmosphere became very unstable with thunderstorms developing along the front.  Most of the storms were associated with the warm front itself,  though  a mesoscale feature moved along the front setting the stage for an additional like of thunderstorms that developed north to south in south central Iowa.  The main feature with the storms was hail.  There were numerous reports of hail ranging from nickel size up to golf ball size.  Several of the storms had well developed meso circulations associated with them.  A few tornadoes resulted.  Two of the tornadoes were very small and only touched down briefly in Tama and Dallas Counties.  The other tornadoes were stronger.  One tornado touched down in Decatur County near Leon.  Two people were injured, one requiring hospitalization, as a mobile home was overturned by the gust front ahead of the storm itself.  The second of the stronger tornadoes moved through Adams County.  A trailer house was overturned and the roofs were removed from two sheds on a farm northeast of Mt. Etna.  Thunderstorms produced very heavy rainfall of one to two inches per hour over Ringgold County.  Total rainfall approached 4 inches in less than 3 hours as storms repeatedly moved across the same areas.  The rain caused flash flooding in the county.  In one instance, Lotts Creek overtopped a road southeast of Mt. Ayr, causing nearly $50,000 in damage as the road washed out.   As the storms moved through Decatur County, lightning stuck a house in Garde Grove.  The house was set on fire, but it was not detected for several hours after the lightning strike.  The house was destroyed and completely burned to the ground.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Intense surface low pressure formed over western Kansas with a central pressure by sunrise on the 11th of 977 Mb.  The weather situation was very dynamic with 500 Mb winds over 100 kts and a very sharp dry punch clearly visible on the satellite pictures.  During the day the warm front that extended east from the low reached into southern Iowa, then extended eastward.  There were two things that occurred during the day.  The first was a very strong supercell that formed over northern Missouri during the morning.  This storm lifted north-northeast at about 50 kts into Iowa, producing a long track tornado with a path extending nearly all the way to Des Moines.  During the afternoon the warm front surged north with the northeast progression of the surface dry line.  Dew points rose into the mid 60s to the south of the warm front across much of the southeast half to two thirds of Iowa.  Surface temperatures in these areas reached the 60s north, with 70s south.  With the atmosphere primed, the dry line began to move into Iowa.  Dew point temperatures behind the dry line were in the 30s with southwest winds of 30 to 50 MPH.  A broken squall line formed on the nose of the dry punch and became severe quickly.  The storm cells themselves were not all that large, but nearly every cell along the line did carry a mesoscale circulation.  There were several tornado touchdowns as the line lifted north as well.  The primary severe weather during this even was the tornadic nature of it.  There were reports of wind and hail, but everything considered these reports were pretty scattered.  There were very few reports of wind and hail with the first supercell as it lifted north out of Missouri.  One inch diameter hail was reported in Ringgold County east of Redding.  Reports of winds and hail were more frequent with the second line of thunderstorms.  There were numerous reports of hail up to marble size with this line, however there were not all that many reports of hail larger than that.  A few reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail were received from Marion and Polk Counties.  The most significant hail occurred in northeast Iowa in Butler County.  Golf ball size hail fell in the town of Parkersburg as the line passed over the city.  There were more reports of wind with the second round.  Nearly all locations reported winds of at least 50 MPH as the line passed overhead.  Scattered reports of winds of 70 to 85 MPH were received.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County as high winds downed power lines and downed outbuildings north of Ogden.  The greatest wind damage occurred over northeast Iowa in Black Hawk and Franklin Counties.  A building was blown off of its foundation and onto an adjacent road southwest of Hampton in Franklin County.  A roof of a barn was damaged and a grain wagon was tipped over northwest of Hampton.  Roof and house damage was reported over parts of Black Hawk County as well.  Five injuries occurred in Warren County at Carlisle when winds of around 65 MPH toppled a school bus.  Twenty one children were on board the bus when it overturned with 5 treated for minor injuries.  Spotty damage was reported around the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.   Several tornadoes occurred with this system.  The most significant tornado entered southern Iowa around mid day.  This  tornado reached minimal F3 intensity just east of Mt. Ayr (Ringgold County).  Property damage is estimated at over $500,000 in Ringgold county alone. Across the Des Moines area of responsibility, at least 15 homes were destroyed, and 60 residences were damaged as around a dozen tornadoes touched down.  A supercell thunderstorm moved north from Missouri into southern Iowa late in the morning of April 11.  The storm produced a tornado in northern Missouri and crossed into Iowa in Ringgold County. The storm, and tornado, moved north through Ringgold County with a continuous damage path half way through the county.   The damage path continued north through northern Ringgold County, southeast Union County and into northwest Clarke County.  In this area, the path was not continuous.  Based on damage reports, the tornado continued to produce occasional damage in Madison County.  Chaser reports indicate the tornado had a multi-vortex structure as it moved through Ringgold and Union Counties.  The last reported sighting was in northern Polk County where a brief touchdown was reported with no damage.  The storm likely produced one tornado from the Missouri border to Madison County with an intermittent damage track.   Damage in Ringgold County was severe with initial estimates around $1 million.  The county was later declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.  A second tornado briefly touched down in northern Polk County.  The touchdown in Polk County was indeed a separate tornado.  Even though the tornado was from the same parent cell, the system had occluded and was in the process of forming a new tornado as it passed over the western part of the Des Moines area.  Reports from this tornado indicate that at least 9 homes were damaged or destroyed, one business destroyed, and a school building damaged.  In addition to losses to homes, one farmstead was hit with considerable damage and some livestock damage.  A series of tornadoes formed on the heels of the supercell tornado as the dry line pushed into the state.  Most of these were brief touchdowns, however the storms were moving around 60 MPH.  Three tornadoes touched down in Boone County.  The most significant tornado touched down north of Ogden.  It produced a 3 mile long track up to 1/8 mile wide.  Farm site hit along highway P70.  Barn and grain bins destroyed, knocking out windows in house. Otherwise only minor damage to house. Debris scattered 1 mile to next farm site where there was minor damage to many buildings. Track continued north-northeast across highway E26 into the campground at Don Williams Lake. A storage building was destroyed, several trees downed, plus outhouses, picnic tables and signs were damaged. The damage track dissipated on the northeast side of the Don Williams Recreation Area.  There were several brief touchdowns with relatively minor damage in Guthrie, Greene, and Hamilton Counties.  A stronger tornado touched down in southeast Black Hawk County, causing significant damage to two homes in the La Porte City area.  The most serious tornado in terms of loss of life occurred in Wapello County.  A tornado developed in rural southern Wapello County, a mile southwest of Agency, Iowa, around 1600 CDT, on Wednesday, April 11.  The tornado path was 50 to 100 yards wide with sporadic touchdowns toward the north-northeast for the next 6 miles.    Survey responses indicated that the duration of impact at any one location was only 15 to 30 seconds as the tornado quickly moved through Agency and over farms at a 60 mph horizontal movement.   The Odd Fellows Lodge in Agency was destroyed, and over 50 residences were damaged.  Two women inside were killed, three people injured and three people had no injuries.  As the storm moved through Agency, a garage was lifted and carried about 100 meters off of its foundation.  The car inside was twisted and covered with debris.  In another incident, one house was hit by the tornado causing damage to the house.  The family dog was in the dog pen at the time.  The tornado lifted the pen and twirled it through the air.  The dog pen was deposited some distance downstream and what was truly amazing was the fact that the dog was uninjured.  Following the tornado, U.S. Highway 34 was closed for 2 hours in order to removed debris from the highway. Governor Tom Vilsack visited the area during a storm survey.  The governor spoke with Brenda Brock of the  National Weather Service, Ellen Gordon, Administrator, Iowa Emergency Management Division, emergency management personnel (fire department, law enforcement, mayor) and the public.  A proclamation for emergency disaster assistance was signed.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> School bus overturned by wind gust.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The damage was caused by a strong gust front preceding a line of early morning thunderstorms.  Wind gusts of 61 mph were measured by the ASOS unit at the Columbus airport, but winds were believed to have gusted to near 80 mph in the downtown Historic District of Columbus.  Extensive and widespread damage occurred to trees, power lines, and structures throughout the Columbus area, particular in the Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Brown Avenue areas.  Martin Luther King Boulevard, as well as Columbus thoroughfares north of Victory Drive and south of Peachtree Mall, were strewn with fallen oaks, splintered pines, and other debris, temporarily blocking traffic.  Damage consisted of 47 trees, some of which were very large, old oak trees, 17 power lines, and 20 traffic lights.  One home was badly damaged when a large oak tree fell across the roof, barely missing the occupant sleeping inside.  Damage was also reported at the Columbus RedStixx baseball park where the awning of the office was ripped off, 2 dugouts roofs were damaged, and 3 sets of bleachers were blown on to the playing field.  In addition, a firefighter on his way to a call was injured when a power line junction box was blown down and through the window of his fire truck.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In St. Mary's County, an F0 tornado, possibly a waterspout that came ashore, crossed the southern tip of Jutland Neck 2 miles southwest of St. Inigoes.  The tornado snapped large trees and destroyed a shed just off Smith Creek on Jutland Drive.  The tornado was 50 yards wide and was on the ground for 1/4 of a mile.  Elsewhere across the county, high winds downed several trees and power lines.  Communities affected included Compton, MIles Town, Clements, Ridge, Leonardtown, Morganza, and Hollywood.  At the intersection of Chancellors Run Road and Route 235, downed trees blocked the road.  In Clements, a large tree was downed onto a mobile home and severely damaged the structure.  One person inside the home suffered a minor knee injury.  Marble sized hail was reported in Hollywood. Dime sized hail fell at Ridge and Point Lookout.  Hail of unknown size fell in Leonardtown.  Rainfall totals included 1.91 inches in Hollywood and 1.43 inches in Oraville.  In Charles County, a waterspout that formed over the Potomac River came ashore on Cobb Island.  The tornado cut a path across the central portion of the island as it moved northeast.  Then it crossed Neale Sound and moved into the community of Rock Point on the mainland before it dissipated.  The 100 yard wide tornado was on the ground for 1.8 miles and was ranked as an F1.  Numerous trees were downed onto roads, cars, utility lines, and homes.  Minor damage was reported to buildings in a three block area around Potomac River Drive.  In Waldorf, a wind gust of 75 MPH and golfball sized hail was reported.  Trees were downed by high wind in Indian Head and in other locations across the county.  In Calvert County, an F0 tornado was spotted by an observer at Patuxent Naval Station and Skywarn spotters crossing the southern tip of Solomon's Island.

Although numerous trees and power lines were blown down across the county, the most concentrated area was from Cedarcreek to Protem in southeast Taney County, where over 400 trees and power lines completely blocked county roads for more than two days. During the height of the storm, Empire District Electric had approximately 3000 customers without power for more than 18 hours, plus fire and rescue personnel had to evacuate 12 people stranded on the dock at Gage's Long Creek Marina west of Ridgedale. In addition, the boat dock at Big Bear Resort was destroyed when the wind lifted the dock off the water, overturning it and all of the boats. A fuel spill occurred at a fuel station on Highway 165 when the fuel level gauge on an above ground storage tank was broken off by the wind. More than 100 gallons of fuel poured into the secondary containment enclosure. Two homes under construction off Highway 265 west of Branson were also damaged.

Most of the injuries occurred to people under the tent and were mainly gashes and bruises. One girl was seriously injured (broken ribs and head injuries) and was flown to a Danville Hospital. The severe thunderstorm also uprooted about 20 to 25 trees. Two trees fell on vehicles. Occupants within one vehicle were not injured. Several trees also struck the main tent.

Winds exceeded 70 mph across the area, resulting in thousands of downed trees and damage to homes and businesses.  What made the storm particularly significant was the sustained strong winds causing more damage than typically experienced with a single severe wind gust.  In Oshkosh, winds of 45 to 70+ mph were recorded for 45 minutes, veering from west to north during that span.  The high winds and rough water knocked over dozens of sailboats on Lake Winnebago, sinking at least one.  The storms knocked out power to at least 100,000 customers.   The hardest hit counties included Wood, Portage, Waupaca, Waushara, southern Outagamie and Winnebago.Two youths at a coffee house in Neenah (Winnebago co.) were injured by flying glass when high winds caused a window to break.Very heavy rain in a short period of time resulted in urban flooding in Appleton.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One person was injured between Reedsburg and Baraboo when a wind-toppled tree fell on their car.  Torrential rains accompanied some of the storms, resulting in urban and small stream flooding in and around Randolph and Fox Lake in northwest Dodge County.  Three-fourths of an inch of rain fell in 25 minutes in Randolph and up to 2 inches fell around Fox Lake.  Up to 1.80 inches of rain fell in a short period of time in the Baraboo to Lake Delton area of Sauk County, resulting in urban and small stream flooding in that county.  Water depths affected roads in northeast Sauk and northwest Dodge Counties where it was reported to be 6 inches to 2 feet deep.  Lightning-initiated fires destroyed two barns on separate farms near Mifflan (Iowa Co.).Synoptically, an upper-level, short-wave trough moved through the Great Lakes region. Instability along the trough was sufficient to allow thunderstorm development.

Fair Haven was hit the hardest. Numerous streets were blocked by downed trees making travel particularly between Fair Haven and Red Bank difficult. Boats were capsized on the Navesink and Shrewsbury Rivers. About 6,000 homes and businesses lost power. The only injuries occurred in Sea Bright when the high winds tore away the outside deck off a waterfront restaurant. No serious injuries were reported. The wind damage began along the Navesink River in Red Bank and continued east following Harding and Ridge Roads into Fair Haven and Little Silver. Damage continued eastward through Rumson's County Golf Club into the Shrewsbury River to Sea Bright. Fair Haven was hit the hardest with extensive tree damage. The tree damage was similar to what happened in Colts Neck the previous year. Damage was estimated of $125,000.  About 6,000 homes and businesses lost power. All power was restored by the 29th. Damaging winds from the severe thunderstorm started in Red Bank. The winds overturned a dozen boats on trailers at the Monmouth Boat Club and overturned two sailboats in the Navesink River. A downed tree trapped two passengers after it fell on it. They were not hurt. Several roads in Fair Haven were closed through the 28th for removal In Little Silver, a house's den was destroyed by a fallen tree. Seven trees were knocked down in Rumson, one fell on a house. In Sea Bright, in addition to the restaurant losing its deck, a downed flag pole damaged two vehicles.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 125K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

They eventually merged into a line of storms as they moved into Racine and Kenosha Counties. Damaging straight-line winds, gusting to an estimated 50 to 56 knots (58 to 65 mph), toppled large trees and/or power lines and poles near Waldo (Sheboygan Co.), east of Spring Prairie (Walworth Co.), near Richmond (Walworth Co.), in the Burlington to Racine area (Racine Co.), around the city of Kenosha (Kenosha Co.), just northwest of Hartford (Washington Co.), from West Allis into Milwaukee (Milwaukee Co.), from the UW-Madison campus to the Capital Square in Madison (Dane Co.), in the city of Waukesha (Waukesha Co.), and in/near Orfordville (Rock Co.).  One person was injured at the State Fair Park in West Allis when the powerful thunderstorm winds blew a fence onto that person's head.  Two homes and several vehicles  in the city of Milwaukee sustained tree damage.  In Orfordville, two buildings were damaged by toppled trees.  Utility companies reported that nearly 40,000 customers lost electrical power as the storms passed through, 19,000 of them in Milwaukee County alone.  Very heavy rains of 1 to 2 inches accompanied the storms, resulting in urban flooding in the city of Milwaukee.  Manhole covers popped in the city and there were reports of 6 inches of water covering some of the city's streets.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 75K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A cold front had slipped into the northwest part of the state and nearly bisected the state by the early evening hours.  Meanwhile, an east-northeast to west-southwest boundary was in place across the central part of the state.  The second boundary was left in place by the convection that occurred earlier in the day.  The airmass remained quite unstable during the evening with dew point temperatures in the mid 60s to around 70.  Colder air continued to slip into the state aloft with the freezing level falling just below 12,000 feet by the early evening.  Another round of thunderstorms fired to the southwest of Iowa and moved into the state during the evening.  Strong winds of 40 kts or more at the 850 mb level pushed over the top of the two boundaries over the state.  Thunderstorms developed rapidly.  This round of thunderstorms produced high winds and some hail.  Though hail was not the predominant form of severe weather with this round, most of the storms did produce at least pea to marble size hail.  Hail of nickle to near one inch in diameter was reported in Adair and Decatur Counties.  The main severe activity this time around was high winds as the storms developed into a series of small bow echoes.  High winds developed in southwest and central Iowa during the early evening.   In Adams County, high winds two 40,000 bushel grain bins were destroyed and blown across the field two miles by downburst winds east of Corning.  North of Corning high winds destroyed a grain elevator, a barn, and damaged several grain bins.  Losses were placed at $250.000.  The storms raced northeast and so did the high winds.  Most of the storms produced winds of 60 MPH or higher.    Winds of 70 MPH ripped through Warren County as one bow element moved east rapidly to the south of the Des Moines Metropolitan area.  The winds flipped over a semi tractor-trailer truck on Interstate 35 just south of Des Moines, west of Cumming.    As the bow echo advanced east, high winds damaged a trailer home in Carlisle, while the roof was blown off of an apartment building.  This was not the only strong bow echo.  Another bow segment moved into Marshall and Jasper Counties.  Winds of 65 to 75 MPH were common in these storms.  Windows were blown out of a house in Jasper County at Newton.  Winds of 70 MPH advanced east into Poweshiek County as well.  A very strong storm moved into Appanoose County during the late evening hours and tore through the county causing considerable damage.  Several mobile homes were destroyed in the town of Centerville by winds near 85 MPH.  One person was injured and was trapped in the debris.  Fortunately, the injury was minor.  A semi tractor-trailer was overturned on the north side of Centerville by the high winds.  A short time before, the storms moved through the Numa area with the high winds completely destroying a farm house there.  It appears the winds from this event were likely a combination of microburst as well as the bow echo itself.  Farther northeast, the main area of thunderstorms that moved through central Iowa passed through the Waterloo area.  Considerable damage was reported in the Waterloo and Cedar Falls areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong area of convection passed through the state during the morning hours.   Though there was only brief clearing, the airmass was able to recharge as winds strengthened aloft and temperatures began to cool.  An upper level disturbance moved rapidly northeast across the state, setting off another round of severe weather in the form of high winds.  A line of thunderstorms developed from north central into southwest Iowa.  Initially they were ahead of an approaching cold front, but soon outran the support of the front.  The upper level system took over changing the line into series of bow echos.  Winds of 60 MPH were first reported in Dallas County of central Iowa.  The storms raced northeast at 60 MPH or more and moved into Story County.  High winds of 60 to 80 MPH were common with these storms as they moved through.  Large trees were downed by the high winds.  One person was injured as the storms moved through Nevada in Story County.  There were several reports of outbuilding damage and damage to grain bins.  Damage was widespread in Story County.  As a result Governor Vilsack declared Story County a disaster area.  In Hardin County west of Hubbard, two barns were destroyed, killing some of the livestock contained within.  The storms continued to move northeast and caused damage to a house northwest of Frederika in Bremer County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The storm was moving to the WSW at about 20 knots.  The microburst had a measured divergent spread of 140 degrees with the left (south) edge of the debris blown to 160 degrees and the right (north) edge of the debris blown to 300 degrees.The destroyed trailer faced south and was hit from the rear by outflow winds from 340 degrees.  This wind direction was about 80 degrees from the path of the storm, implying that there was practically no translational speed added into this wind, therefore, it is thought that the trailer was destoyed by no more than a 60 mph wind.  The trailer was flipped onto its roof, then came apart, and was spread across the road and into the field to the south.  A man and his son were in the trailer at the time of the event.  The man suffered a minor neck injury. A couple of barns and a carport were destroyed as well, and several residences sustained damage ranging from shingles loosened to structural damage of a garage and outside wall.The storm cluster producing this microburst had also produced a microburst over the city of Fort Smith, Arkansas.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

During the heating of the afternoon, thunderstorms erupted in the unstable air.  The freezing level was around 15,000 feet, so hail was not a great threat.  Surface dew point temperatures were in the upper 60s to low 70s with precipitable water values around 1.75 inches.  Thunderstorms fired southwest of the Des Moines metropolitan area.  A tornado touched down in rural Madison County.  The tornado was about 60 feet wide and produced a half mile long path of damage in open country.    As the storms moved northeast they continued to intensity.  One cell dropped a tornado at the Glen Oaks Golf Course in West Des Moines, causing some minor damage there.  The tornado tracked northeast and flipped a semi tractor-trailer truck in Interstate 35 resulting in one injury.  It continued northeast and hit an apartment complex causing damage to the building and destroying an 8-car garage.  The path was more intermittent as it continued northeast into the city.  There were numerous reports of trees and power lines being downed.  The tornado lifted as the event transitioned into a high wind event.  The storms produced wind damage in Johnston as it moved through the area.  High winds of 80 to 85 MPH occurred in northern Polk and southern Story Counties before they weakened.  A grain bin was flattened, along with tree and crop damage, as the storm moved through the Elkhart area.  Just northwest of that, in Slater, high winds took the roof off of a house in southern Story County.  One person in the house was injured.  The storms continued to track northeast, eventually dropping another tornado in Butler and Bremer Counties.  The tornado had a somewhat intermittent track touching down south of Shell Rock and lifting northeast of Waverly.  For the most part the tornado tracked through corn fields there.  One farmstead was hit in Butler County.  A grain bin was destroyed and blown one quarter of a mile across a field, another was blown off its foundation, a shed was destroyed, and crops were damaged.  In Bremer County, one car and a garage were damaged along the tornadoes path.  Another farmstead was hit north of Waverly.  Part of a machine garage was destroyed and blown about 30 feet off of its foundation.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 75K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This storm exhibited very subtle bowing, but otherwise there was little to note about it's structure. Damage from this storm was limited to a residential mobile and modular home area perched on a broad hill. The homes were situated on 1 acre lots, so they were not densely packed.The damage primarily consisted of rolled and broken mobile homes. The damage area was limited to an area less than one mile in diameter. Five mobile homes were rolled and destroyed. Four mobile and modular homes sustained major roof damage. The mobile homes that were destroyed were scattered between homes which were completely undamaged. Examination of destroyed homes indicated that they were not tied down or had inadequate or no skirting at all. Homes that had plywood skirting and were tied down weathered the storm. Debris patterns provided evidence of diffluent winds, suggesting straight-line downburst winds. Five people recieved minor injuries from side being inside rolled mobile homes. Two injuries were the result of wind driven hail after escaping a destroyed mobile home.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 213K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first supercell storm moved into southwest Kalamazoo county just southwest of Schoolcraft. This storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across Kalamazoo, extreme northwest Calhoun, southeast Barry, northwest Eaton, southeast Ionia, northwest Clinton and Gratiot counties. It produced a swath of damage 2 miles wide in which thousands of trees were either broken off or uprooted, and some structural damage occurred to homes, barns and larger buildings. Much of the damage resulted from trees falling on homes. A few older homes had major structural damage when their roofs were blown off and walls knocked down. Power lines were blown down along the entire track of the storm, leaving about 15,000 people without power. Straight line winds of 60 to 70 m.p.h. were common and storm damage indicated that downbursts produced winds of 90 to 100 m.p.h. The second supercell began producing damage in Marshall, in central Calhoun county. The storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across north central Calhoun, southeast Eaton, northwest Ingham, and extreme southeast Clinton counties. This storm generally produced winds between 60 and 80 m.p.h. across Calhoun county, where it blew part of a roof off a hotel in Marshall and also uprooted trees and produced minor structural damage across the rest of the county. The storm intensified as it moved into Eaton county, where it produced straight line wind damage consistent with 90 to 110 m.p.h. winds as it crossed Narrow Lake, near Brookfield. It snapped off trees, caused structural damage to homes, and took out power lines at Narrow Lake. The storm crossed the remainder of the county and uprooted trees, downed power lines, blew a home off its foundation, and blew in garage doors that caused garage roofs to lift up and cave in. The storm damaged about 60 homes across Eaton county and caused about one million dollars worth of damage. The storm entered Ingham county and produced damage consistent with 60 to 80 m.p.h. winds. As it crossed Jolly road, a very localized downburst to 120 m.p.h. snapped 18 inch diameter power poles about 20 feet above the ground. It toppled trees in East Lansing and did minor damage to roofs. The storm blew over and damaged quonset huts utilized for storage at Michigan State Police Headquarters in East Lansing. Only minor additional damage was reported as the storm moved across extreme southeast Clinton county. The third supercell storm began near Tekonsha in south central Calhoun county. It moved northeast between 50 and 55 m.p.h. across Calhoun, northwest Jackson and Ingham county. It produced winds to 90 m.p.h. in Tekonsha where it destroyed a number of mobile homes, causing injuries to 6 people. The storm produced mainly tree damage and minor structural damage along the remainder of it's track, and also blew down a barn just north of Webberville in Ingham county. One fatality occurred 3 miles east of Maple Rapids, where a tree was blown down onto a pickup truck, killing the 46 year old Maple Rapids man who was driving.  The rest of the thunderstorms across the area blew down several trees and power lines but did not cause extensive damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first supercell storm moved into southwest Kalamazoo county just southwest of Schoolcraft. This storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across Kalamazoo, extreme northwest Calhoun, southeast Barry, northwest Eaton, southeast Ionia, northwest Clinton and Gratiot counties. It produced a swath of damage 2 miles wide in which thousands of trees were either broken off or uprooted, and some structural damage occurred to homes, barns and larger buildings. Much of the damage resulted from trees falling on homes. A few older homes had major structural damage when their roofs were blown off and walls knocked down. Power lines were blown down along the entire track of the storm, leaving about 15,000 people without power. Straight line winds of 60 to 70 m.p.h. were common and storm damage indicated that downbursts produced winds of 90 to 100 m.p.h. The second supercell began producing damage in Marshall, in central Calhoun county. The storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across north central Calhoun, southeast Eaton, northwest Ingham, and extreme southeast Clinton counties. This storm generally produced winds between 60 and 80 m.p.h. across Calhoun county, where it blew part of a roof off a hotel in Marshall and also uprooted trees and produced minor structural damage across the rest of the county. The storm intensified as it moved into Eaton county, where it produced straight line wind damage consistent with 90 to 110 m.p.h. winds as it crossed Narrow Lake, near Brookfield. It snapped off trees, caused structural damage to homes, and took out power lines at Narrow Lake. The storm crossed the remainder of the county and uprooted trees, downed power lines, blew a home off its foundation, and blew in garage doors that caused garage roofs to lift up and cave in. The storm damaged about 60 homes across Eaton county and caused about one million dollars worth of damage. The storm entered Ingham county and produced damage consistent with 60 to 80 m.p.h. winds. As it crossed Jolly road, a very localized downburst to 120 m.p.h. snapped 18 inch diameter power poles about 20 feet above the ground. It toppled trees in East Lansing and did minor damage to roofs. The storm blew over and damaged quonset huts utilized for storage at Michigan State Police Headquarters in East Lansing. Only minor additional damage was reported as the storm moved across extreme southeast Clinton county. The third supercell storm began near Tekonsha in south central Calhoun county. It moved northeast between 50 and 55 m.p.h. across Calhoun, northwest Jackson and Ingham county. It produced winds to 90 m.p.h. in Tekonsha where it destroyed a number of mobile homes, causing injuries to 6 people. The storm produced mainly tree damage and minor structural damage along the remainder of it's track, and also blew down a barn just north of Webberville in Ingham county. One fatality occurred 3 miles east of Maple Rapids, where a tree was blown down onto a pickup truck, killing the 46 year old Maple Rapids man who was driving.  The rest of the thunderstorms across the area blew down several trees and power lines but did not cause extensive damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
