The storm moved east across Ballard County, producing quarter-size hail. One-inch diameter hail was reported on U.S. Highway 60 at mile marker 7, near Barlow. Hailstones grew larger as the storm crossed McCracken County, pounding the southwest side of Paducah and Lone Oak with hail from golf ball to tennis ball size. Thousands of vehicles were dented, and hail broke some windshields, including the windshield of a deputy sheriff's vehicle. The roofs of hundreds of buildings sustained at least minor damage. The only known injury occurred in Paducah, when a woman leaving church received cuts and abrasions from hailstones. She was treated at a local hospital. As the storm continued east across northern Marshall County, hail up to baseball size broke the windshields of many vehicles and damaged the siding and roofing of homes. A downburst with estimated 80 MPH winds began along Highway 641 and continued east for 3 miles toward Kentucky Lake. Numerous trees were blown down, some of which landed on houses. In Lyon County, the storm produced golf-ball hail east of Barkley Dam before finally weakening. Although total damage estimates as reported by insurance companies are in the tens of millions of dollars, the exact amount will never be known.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A severe thunderstorm emerged into Cameron County from northern Mexico and dropped large amounts of wind-driven hail upon the city.  The hail destroyed roofs of homes and businesses, broke countless windows of automobiles and homes, and damaged vegetation.  Approximately 10,000 insurance claims have been filed in association with this storm.  Most of the large hail reports occurred between 925 and 950 CDT.The Brownsville Police Department reported that 12 cruisers had windshields shattered by hail, and Hanna High School in central Brownsville reported 285 automobiles with wndows broken by hail.  Much of the northern and central portions of the city suffered damage from this intense and historic storm.  The storm was heavily documented and covered in the media with widespread accounts of its damage.  The storm proceeded eastward and downed power lines in the community of Laguna Vista.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Although individual storms were moving toward the northeast, the line appeared to be moving to the southeast.  The downburst winds were all discharged toward the southwest, as all damage around Crystal City area was blown in that direction.  Damage was severe in Crystal City.  Leaves had been shredded from trees and plastered onto the sides of the cars and houses, and streets were covered with the shredded leaves.  Homes had damage to their outside walls, roofs, and windows.  What was shocking was to see the piles of semi-melted hail still as high as 2 feet in some of the drifts created by the flooding.  In spite of the fact that the hail had been melting for over 24 hours when the survey was made, it was still piled in spotty waves across the city from east to west and north to south.  Hail was reported to have been as large as 1.5 to 2 inches in diameter, with a couple of reports of hail to 3 inches.  The high winds, combined with hail and rain, caused widespread damage to homes, destroying two mobile homes and the roofs of two houses.  Several dozen homes in Crystal City sustained some type of damage.  Some of the worst damage occurred at the library and the H.E.B. grocery store.  The metal roof was blown off the library and deposited on the southwest side of the building.  The roof of the H.E.B. grocery store collapsed.  It appeared to be beneath the area where the air conditioners were positioned on the west side of the store.  This is also where the rain and ice would have accumulated the thickest and would possibly have clogged drainage holes.  One injury was reported in the storms.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Severe thunderstorms were responsible for tornadoes, very large hail and flash flooding, mainly east of Columbus to Hastings line. Fillmore County was hardest hit. A tornado in the northwest corner of the county damaged a center pivot. The county Emergency Manager was injured by flying glass after baseball sized hail pummeled his vehicles' windshield. He was treated and released from the hospital that evening. The hail hammered much of the county over the course of 3 to 4 hours. Geneva sustained some of the more widespread property damage. Damage in Fillmore County totaled in the millions. In York County, a tornado was reported south of Lushton, but not damaged was noted. Drifts of golf ball size hail and heavy rain pounded York County as well. 	Flash flooding was reported in York and Polk counties. In York County, the underpass north of downtown was full of water and the Beaver Creek Trails on the west side of town flooded. In Polk County, there were several roads reported under water around 8 pm in eastern sections of the county. Heavy rain of 1 to 3 inches in eastern Nuckolls County caused damage to county roads around Ruskin and Hardy.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Baseball size hail pounded the vehicle of the Fillmore County Emergency Manager.

They noted widespread damage to trees and vegetation beginning near that point and continuing northward to the San Marcos Tanger Outlet Mall and Prime Time Outlet Mall.  The damage was caused by a combination of large hail and winds gusting 40 to 50 mph.  NWS NEXRAD Radar late Thursday afternoon had indicated severe thunderstorms in that area moving toward the northeast.At the south end of the Malls, the parking lot surface was covered with dents and impressions produced by the wind and hail. Hundreds of vehicles had been damaged in this event but only a few remained in the area.  Most of these had all of the window glass broken out with hundreds of hail dents in the car bodies.  At this part of the Malls, damage to store signs was seen only on the north and west sides of buildings.  There was no damage to signs on the south and east sides.  Therefore, the storm winds had propelled the hail toward the southeast.  In addition to the sign damage, hundreds of roof tiles had been broken and cracked, and many of these had fallen into the parking lot during the storm.As the team drove northward through the Mall areas, the same type of damage to building signs and roofs as well as parking surfaces was seen.  However, at the north end of the Malls, damage to the store signs was confined to the south and west walls of the buildings.  In this part of the Malls, the damaging winds had propelled the hail toward the northeast.  Thus, the pattern of damage was fan-shaped, with the winds generally blowing the hail toward the west, but with a southeast component of motion on the south end of the Malls and a northeast component of motion on the north end of the Malls.  This type of damage is clearly indicative of straight-line winds, also referred to as "downburst winds."  One of the NWS staff members was at the Malls during the storm.  Dents in his vehicle were 4.25 inches in diameter, indicating that at some of the hail stones were as large as grapefruits.  He had estimated windspeeds to be between 60 and 70 mph.The team drove roads in all directions from the Mall areas and concluded that the severe wind and hail had caused the worst damage in an area enclosed by Wonder World Drive, Posey Road, Hunter Road, and FM266 which is also known as Old Bastrop Highway.  Other areas of large hail and damaging winds were reported to the NWS, but the level of damage was generally more isolated and less severe.Damages from this storm were estimated at $100M with up to 10,000 vehicles damaged and another 7000 vehicles in homes in the area.  Losses to businesses as a result of closing the following day were estimated at $500,000.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A cold front extended from northwest Minnesota into central Kansas.  The cold front moved into the northwest corner of Iowa by the mid afternoon hours.  Surface CAPE values were quite high at 3500 to 5500 J/kg, however there was very little 0-3 km shear.  Shear values were under 10 kts.  Afternoon high temperatures reached the mid 80s to mid 90s.  These temperatures, combined with dew point readings around 70, produced lifted indices in the -8 to -11 C. range.  Convection was limited by convection that had occurred during the morning to the south of Iowa.  The outflow boundary moved into the area, tending to stabilize the airmass somewhat for the afternoon hours.  Thunderstorms that did develop tended to produce hail.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the sounding were in the 400 to 700 J/kg range.  These values were quite high, but were countered by the high freezing levels.  Mid afternoon freezing levels were between 13,500 and 14500 feet.  The lower part of the sounding was quite dry, and as a result the LCL value was between 7000 to 8000 feet, significantly reducing the tornado threat.  Thunderstorms developed during the mid afternoon hours over north central Iowa.  One of them produced nickle size hail as it moved east of Northwood in Worth County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A moist and unstable airmass ahead of the cold front provided the fuel to generate severe thunderstorms that included five tornadoes, near record-size hail and damaging winds.  Thousands of homes sustained damage and about 15,000 customers lost power during the storms, some for almost 3 days as trees blocked roads and slowed repair work to power lines.  Four people sustained minor injuries, and total damage from the storms exceeded $60 million.||The first tornado of the outbreak moved across eastern Marathon County shortly after 4:00 PM CDT, producing damage to several homes.  The tornado was rated EF2.||A second thunderstorm produced a weak tornado in Wood County, which was rated EF0.  The same storm responsible for this tornado produced softball size hail that damaged thousands of homes, several businesses and hundreds of vehicles.  One hailstone that fell in Port Edwards measured 5.50 inches in diameter, making it the second largest hailstone on record in Wisconsin.||The same supercell thunderstorm that produced the Marathon County tornado also produced a long-track tornado across northeast Shawano, northwest Menominee, southeast Langlade and northern Oconto counties.  This tornado was on the ground for 47 minutes, covering 40.1 miles, and destroyed 14,400 acres of woodlands (timber loss was estimated at $12.5 million) and dozens of buildings along its path.  The twister, which was over one-half mile at times, was rated EF3, with peak winds estimated of 150 to 160 mph.  The storm responsible for the tornado also produced significant straight-line wind damage as it moved into western Marinette County.  ||The fourth tornado of the outbreak, rated EF1, developed near Cedarville in Marinette Co., which was from the same thunderstorm that produced the long-track tornado. ||The final tornado of the afternoon and evening touched down near Harmony in Marinette Co.  This tornado was rated EF1.||Details of the tornadoes, hail, and wind damage can be found in the event narratives of the affected counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Hail broke the windshield of a FedEx delivery truck.
