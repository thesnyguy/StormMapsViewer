In addition to these tornadoes, a major flood developed over Harris and surrounding counties during the middle of this tornadic outbreak. Over 300 homes, along with hundreds of vehicles, were flooded.These tornadic storms developed over parts of Wharton and Matagorda counties shortly after sunrise with the first confirmed tornado occurring just east of El Campo around 9:00 am. Strong 500mb upper level troughing over the western U.S. moved from west to east across the Southern Plains. The polar jet stream associated with this 500 millibar trough surged into west Texas and then curved sharply northeastward into the Central Plains. The sub-tropical jet stream was oriented west to east across deep southern Texas. This jet stream pattern was the impetus to strong lower level convergence due to the enhanced upper level divergence. Low level moisture had substantially increased and was about 200 percent of normal by 6 AM.

In addition to these tornadoes, a major flood developed over Harris and surrounding counties during the middle of this tornadic outbreak. Over 300 homes, along with hundreds of vehicles, were flooded.These tornadic storms developed over parts of Wharton and Matagorda counties shortly after sunrise with the first confirmed tornado occurring just east of El Campo around 9:00 am. Strong 500mb upper level troughing over the western U.S. moved from west to east across the Southern Plains. The polar jet stream associated with this 500 millibar trough surged into west Texas and then curved sharply northeastward into the Central Plains. The sub-tropical jet stream was oriented west to east across deep southern Texas. This jet stream pattern was the impetus to strong lower level convergence due to the enhanced upper level divergence. Low level moisture had substantially increased and was about 200 percent of normal by 6 AM. Vertical wind profiles also showed a great deal of low level wind shear with the greatest shear occurring in the lowest 2000 feet. In addition, these veering wind speeds rapidly increased with height. A focus for the thunderstorm development was provided by a weak low level boundary which was aligned southwest to northeast, or generally along the U.S. Highway 59 corridor.

The storm produced a 33-mile long tornado that killed two and injured about 33. A small but very damaging downburst occurred several miles  south of the tornado track.  A swath of large hail occurred north of the tornado track. Hailstones up to 2 inches in diameter were reported at and near the intersection of Highways 145 and 147, near the community of Glendale in Pope County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This violent tornado began near Grand Chain and reached its maximum intensity of 210 MPH as it neared the Massac County line. A 53-year-old man was killed when the chimney of his house collapsed on him. The man, who was in his basement, was protecting his son by lying on top of him when the collapse occurred. The son received broken bones. Their house was impaled by some nearby large trees that prevented it from being swept farther away. Along the Pulaski County portion of the tornado path, six single family homes and ten mobile homes were destroyed. Another ten single family homes and a mobile home had major damage. A few dozen other residences received some type of minor damage. A few dozen outbuildings, two businesses, and a campground were destroyed or had major damage. Approximately 13 persons were injured, but only a few of those required hospitalization. All roads in the damage area were impassable due to large numbers of trees and building debris on them. Many of the tornado victims in this county had no insurance on their residences. The area of most intense destruction was along Tick Ridge Road, a state road that follows a ridge above the Ohio River.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A 53-year-old man was killed when the chimney of his house collapsed on him. The man, who was in his basement, was protecting his son by lying on top of him when the collapse occurred. The son received broken bones. Their house was impaled by some nearby large trees that prevented it from being swept farther away. Along the Pulaski County portion of the tornado path, six single family homes and ten mobile homes were destroyed. Another ten single family homes and a mobile home had major damage. A few dozen other residences received some type of minor damage. A few dozen outbuildings, two businesses, and a campground were destroyed or had major damage. Approximately 13 persons were injured, but only a few of those required hospitalization. All roads in the damage area were impassable due to large numbers of trees and building debris on them. Many of the tornado victims in this county had no insurance on their residences. The area of most intense destruction was along Tick Ridge Road, a state road that follows a ridge above the Ohio River.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Estimated winds of 210 MPH disintegrated mobile homes and levelled several modern frame homes. One frame house was swept clean off its foundation, with only the roof left intact in a creek about 200 yards away. Many vehicles were lifted, rolled, or thrown up to 100 yards or more. Numerous cases of missiling were observed, including glass embedded in trees. Tree destruction in forested areas was nearly complete, and a few trees were debarked. The only fatality in Massac County was a 65-year-old female who was killed when her mobile home disintegrated. The official cause of death was blunt trauma to the head. She was found in a water-filled ravine about 100 yards from the former site of her mobile home. The frame of the mobile home was wrapped around the trunks of two trees that were stripped of all their limbs. Most of the levelled frame homes were concentrated on Boaz Road and Rolling Hills Road, in or near Hillerman. After passing through Hillerman, the tornado overturned dozens of railroad cars of a train just west of the Mermet Lake Conservation Area, which is off U.S. Route 45. The Mermet Lake Conservation Area was extensively damaged. An estimated 300 acres of forest were destroyed, boat docks were destroyed, and bathing facilities were destroyed. Dozens of waterfowl were found dead. After destroying additional residences and high tension power lines, the tornado crossed Interstate 24 near mile marker 28, about a mile south of the New Columbia exit. Tractor-trailer rigs and a tour bus were overturned on the interstate, injuring the drivers. The interstate was closed due to grain bins, tree limbs, and some building debris on the highway. Additional residences were destroyed between the interstate and the Pope County line. The tornado crossed into Pope County near where Illinois Route 145 crosses the county line. In Massac County, a total of 15 single-family houses and 13 mobile homes were destroyed. About 20 other single-family houses and 15 mobile homes received major damage. Several dozen other residences had some type of minor damage. Numerous vehicles and farming implements were destroyed, including combines. About 20 persons were injured in Massac County, but only one or two were hospitalized in serious or critical condition. Most of the injuries involved lacerations, bruises, broken bones, and internal injuries. Near Hillerman, a deputy sheriff escaped unhurt after his patrol car was thrown about 50 yards and struck by a flying tree and telephone pole.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

From there, the tornado traveled east-northeast across SR-9 and County Road 55, where it caused considerable damage to greenhouses at a nursery business as well as chicken houses and other farm structures.The tornado then moved through open country for about a mile and a half continuing to uproot trees before destroying a mobile home on Chinch Creek Road. From there, the tornado moved eastward into a wooded area of Cleburne County, across Rattlesnake Mountain, causing sporadic tree damage until it lifted about a half mile east of the Shoal Creek Picnic area.The tornado destroyed two homes and damaged 21 others according to EMA and Red Cross damage assessments.  Alabama Power reported that 250 people were without power.The tornado was rated an F1, mainly based on the amount of damage done to a mobile home on Chinch Creek Road. The tornado path length was about 8.9 miles. The average damage path width directly associated with the tornado was 100-200 yards, although peripheral damage occurred up to a half mile south of center of the tornado path.Begin:  33 45.200/ 85 41.468  End:  33 46.290/85 32.700<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado continued some F2 to F3 damage northeast near 84th Terrace north of Leavenworth Road. This is the location where an 82 year old man was killed in his residence. The tornado continued northeast through Wyandotte county, where another instance of marginal  F4 damage was noted near 79th Street and Cernech. Considerable structural damage was noted in this location, along with four 150 foot-tall metal power poles engineered to withstand maximum winds over 200 mph. The tornado produced F1 to F2 damage up to the Missouri River before crossing into Platte county Missouri, near Riverside and Parkville around 335 pm CST.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One storm near Aurora produced very large hail.  One stone measured by an NWS Storm Survey team was determined to be the largest sized stone to fall in the United States.  It measured 7 inches in diameter and 18.75 inches in circumference.  Many other large stones were noted on the northern side of Aurora.  Given the lack of wind, damage was limited to roofs, a few windows and some crop land near town.  The storm also produced a couple of brief small tornadoes as it slowly moved through northern Hamilton county.At nearly the same time, another very slow moving storm produced several tornadoes, hail and extremely heavy rains in Thayer county. One tornado moved through the town of Deshler going from the southeast side of town to the west.  One man was killed in his garage before he was able to get to shelter.  Over 400 homes in Deshler were damaged with four being completely demolished.  Nearly 100 homes were moderately to severely damaged.  Six businesses in town were considered a complete loss and 25 others reportedly suffered moderate to severe damage.  Seven people were injured, most were minor and were from broken glass.  Later in the evening, a tornado was reported north of Bradshaw in York county.  Storm spotters about 1 mile west of the tornado saw debris being flung through the air.  A farmstead was hit with most of the damage done to an old barn.Despite ongoing drought conditions, widespread flooding was reported in Thayer and southern Fillmore counties.  The flash flood along the Rose Creek at Hubbell provided some of the worst damage.  Water was flowing into houses and businesses on main street to the tune of up to 5 feet deep.  Boats were the only mode of travel through the business district.  Up to 15 residents had to be evacuated by the local Dive and Rescue team using jet skis.  The flooding was caused by extremely heavy rainfall in nearby Republic County, Kansas.Flooding and flash flooding was also a problem throughout Thayer county.  Rainfall of over 12 inches was reported about 5 miles north of Deshler.  Residents reported nearly 5 hours of constant, wind-driven rain.  Windows were blown out and the rain just poured into homes.  Widespread agricultural damage was done due to the rain.  The runoff in the Snake and Spring creeks ravaged Deshler, the town which had already been hammered by tornadoes that evening.  Flooding was concentrated in the southern part of town and most widespread near the park and fairgrounds.Major river flooding was reported along the Little Blue River from just west of Hebron to the Jefferson county line.  One man at his farmstead near Gilead had to be air lifted to safety by the National Guard as flooding waters rose on his property.  Dozens of county roads and bridges were damaged or destroyed.  U. S. Highway 81 was restricted to one lane travel at Hebron due to the high water on the road.  Portions of Highways 81, 136 and 9 were closed for a time due to high water.  The Big Sandy Creek flowed out of its banks at Alexandria and crested at 14.5 feet.  Water was flowing over the highway near town and filling back into the town's sewer drains.  In all, several million dollars in damage was done by the flooding alone.  Some locals said this was the worst flooding in the area in 55 years.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A strong tornado set down on the southeast side of Deshler near the fairgrounds and moved west through the south side of Deshler.

One storm near Aurora produced very large hail.  One stone measured by an NWS Storm Survey team was determined to be the largest sized stone to fall in the United States.  It measured 7 inches in diameter and 18.75 inches in circumference.  Many other large stones were noted on the northern side of Aurora.  Given the lack of wind, damage was limited to roofs, a few windows and some crop land near town.  The storm also produced a couple of brief small tornadoes as it slowly moved through northern Hamilton county.At nearly the same time, another very slow moving storm produced several tornadoes, hail and extremely heavy rains in Thayer county. One tornado moved through the town of Deshler going from the southeast side of town to the west.  One man was killed in his garage before he was able to get to shelter.  Over 400 homes in Deshler were damaged with four being completely demolished.  Nearly 100 homes were moderately to severely damaged.  Six businesses in town were considered a complete loss and 25 others reportedly suffered moderate to severe damage.  Seven people were injured, most were minor and were from broken glass.  Later in the evening, a tornado was reported north of Bradshaw in York county.  Storm spotters about 1 mile west of the tornado saw debris being flung through the air.  A farmstead was hit with most of the damage done to an old barn.Despite ongoing drought conditions, widespread flooding was reported in Thayer and southern Fillmore counties.  The flash flood along the Rose Creek at Hubbell provided some of the worst damage.  Water was flowing into houses and businesses on main street to the tune of up to 5 feet deep.  Boats were the only mode of travel through the business district.  Up to 15 residents had to be evacuated by the local Dive and Rescue team using jet skis.  The flooding was caused by extremely heavy rainfall in nearby Republic County, Kansas.Flooding and flash flooding was also a problem throughout Thayer county.  Rainfall of over 12 inches was reported about 5 miles north of Deshler.  Residents reported nearly 5 hours of constant, wind-driven rain.  Windows were blown out and the rain just poured into homes.  Widespread agricultural damage was done due to the rain.  The runoff in the Snake and Spring creeks ravaged Deshler, the town which had already been hammered by tornadoes that evening.  Flooding was concentrated in the southern part of town and most widespread near the park and fairgrounds.Major river flooding was reported along the Little Blue River from just west of Hebron to the Jefferson county line.  One man at his farmstead near Gilead had to be air lifted to safety by the National Guard as flooding waters rose on his property.  Dozens of county roads and bridges were damaged or destroyed.  U. S. Highway 81 was restricted to one lane travel at Hebron due to the high water on the road.  Portions of Highways 81, 136 and 9 were closed for a time due to high water.  The Big Sandy Creek flowed out of its banks at Alexandria and crested at 14.5 feet.  Water was flowing over the highway near town and filling back into the town's sewer drains.  In all, several million dollars in damage was done by the flooding alone.  Some locals said this was the worst flooding in the area in 55 years.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A strong tornado set down on the southeast side of Deshler near the fairgrounds and moved west through the south side of Deshler.

One supercell produced three tornadoes that affected Moore, southern Oklahoma City, Midwest City, and Choctaw. A few locations in Moore and southeast Oklahoma City had also been hit by an F5 tornado that moved through the area on May 3, 1999. The General Motors Plant in southeast Oklahoma City sustained some of the most significant damage. This event was the second tornadic event of the day. Several tornadoes moved across south central Oklahoma during the early morning hours of May 8th (refer to appropriate data). This event was also the first of two days in a row where the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area was affected by tornadoes (refer to May 9, 2003 data). These thunderstorms developed near and along a strong dryline located across central Oklahoma.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the first segment of a tornado that began in Cleveland County and moved into Oklahoma County before dissipating 2.5 miles south-southeast of Choctaw. The tornado began in the area of Northwest 5th Street and Santa Fe Avenue in Moore, near the Church of Latter Day Saints. Damage intensities increased quickly to F2 and isolated F3 as the tornado, initially narrow, moved east along 5th street. Substantial structural damage in this initial touchdown area was confined to homes on the north side of 5th Street, just east of Santa Fe. Homes on the south side of 5th, and those on 6th Street one block to the north, were relatively undamaged.The damage track then widened quickly to nearly one-fifth of a mile as the tornado turned more to the northeast through residential areas, crossing Markwell Avenue between North 2nd and North 7th Streets. The most significant damage on Markwell, rated F2, was at North 6th Street. Continuing northeast and widening to nearly a quarter of a mile, the tornado crossed Janeway Avenue between Dillon Avenue (south edge) and 12th Street (north edge). Maximum damage on Janeway was to homes near 8th Street, and was rated F2.Damage intensity increased to F3 as the tornado approached 12th Street between Janeway and Interstate 35. A commercial building on the south side of 12th suffered F3 damage, as did several homes on the north side of 12th Street at City Avenue where several homes lost most of their outside walls. Maximum damage intensity on Sunrise Avenue (north of 12th and one block east of City Ave.) was rated strong F2 and consisted mostly of homes being partially or totally unroofed. Several vehicles were tossed into front yards, and in one case nearly into the front of a home.The worst damage produced within the city of Moore was as the tornado approached west sides of Interstate 35, just north of 12th Street. Damage in this area included major damage to two hotels, the First Christian Church, the Young Child Development Center, a Project Headstart building, an office building, and several restaurants. The church, child care center, and office building were leveled. The two hotels, both two-story, had their second floors partially or totally removed by the tornado. At least a half dozen vehicles were tossed in this area, with evidence suggesting that some of them may have traveled 100 yards or more. Had the leveled buildings here shown evidence of better construction, damage might have been rated F4. As it was, damage here was rated strong F3.A southbound moving Greyhound bus was hit by the tornado as it crossed Interstate 35. The bus was carrying twenty-three passengers, some of which chose to disembark to take cover in a ditch while others chose to stay on the bus. The bus rolled several times jostling passengers around the interior. Passengers were trapped between crushed seats and buckled walls while others were left hanging upside down and out broken windows. Of those that hid in the ditch, eleven were injured by flying debris. Eight passengers that stayed on the bus were also injured. Most of the injuries to the passengers were minor.The tornado crossed Interstate 35 0.25 to 0.50 miles north of 12th Street, damaging or destroying several businesses along Broadway, just east of the interstate. Intensity dropped to F2 in this area, but the path width remained close to a quarter of a mile. The tornado continued northeast across south and east parts of the Highland Park residential area, causing F1 and spotty F2 damage. The tornado weakened to F1 intensity and turned slightly to the north-northeast as it crossed Pole Road and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad tracks near and just south of Northeast 27th Street.It should be noted that the damage track of this tornado through Moore was nearly parallel to, and generally a quarter of a mile or less south of, the track of the F5 tornado that struck Moore on 3 May 1999. In fact, Highland Park also suffered extensive damage from the May 3rd tornado, but that damage was mainly in the north and west parts of the area. The damage track through Highland Park on 8 May 2003 was roughly two blocks farther south.The tornado crossed Northeast 27th between Pole Road and Eastern Avenue and continued northeast, crossing Eastern at the Lakeside Golf Course, just east of Eastern and straddling the Oklahoma City and Moore city limits. This golf course also took a direct hit from the tornado on 3 May 1999, and from this point northeastward for about one mile, the two tornado tracks overlapped. The tornado, at this point F1, continued northeast from the golf course into an open field just south of Southeast 89th Street, then struck the northwest part of a subdivision just south of 89th Street and west of Bryant Avenue. More than a dozen residences, including duplexes and single-family homes, were heavily damaged or destroyed in this area. The same northwest part of this subdivision was hit hard on 3 May 1999; many of the homes damaged or destroyed on 8 May had been rebuilt and were less than four years old.This tornado continued into Oklahoma County becoming an F4 and traveling a total of 17.3 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 210M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Passengers were trapped between crushed seats and buckled walls while others were left hanging upside down and out broken windows. Of those that hid in the ditch, eleven were injured by flying debris. Eight passengers that stayed on the bus were also injured. Most of the injuries to the passengers were minor.The tornado crossed Interstate 35 0.25 to 0.50 miles north of 12th Street, damaging or destroying several businesses along Broadway, just east of the interstate. Intensity dropped to F2 in this area, but the path width remained close to a quarter of a mile. The tornado continued northeast across south and east parts of the Highland Park residential area, causing F1 and spotty F2 damage. The tornado weakened to F1 intensity and turned slightly to the north-northeast as it crossed Pole Road and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad tracks near and just south of Northeast 27th Street.It should be noted that the damage track of this tornado through Moore was nearly parallel to, and generally a quarter of a mile or less south of, the track of the F5 tornado that struck Moore on 3 May 1999. In fact, Highland Park also suffered extensive damage from the May 3rd tornado, but that damage was mainly in the north and west parts of the area. The damage track through Highland Park on 8 May 2003 was roughly two blocks farther south.The tornado crossed Northeast 27th between Pole Road and Eastern Avenue and continued northeast, crossing Eastern at the Lakeside Golf Course, just east of Eastern and straddling the Oklahoma City and Moore city limits. This golf course also took a direct hit from the tornado on 3 May 1999, and from this point northeastward for about one mile, the two tornado tracks overlapped. The tornado, at this point F1, continued northeast from the golf course into an open field just south of Southeast 89th Street, then struck the northwest part of a subdivision just south of 89th Street and west of Bryant Avenue. More than a dozen residences, including duplexes and single-family homes, were heavily damaged or destroyed in this area. The same northwest part of this subdivision was hit hard on 3 May 1999; many of the homes damaged or destroyed on 8 May had been rebuilt and were less than four years old.This tornado continued into Oklahoma County becoming an F4 and traveling a total of 17.3 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 210M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One supercell produced three tornadoes that affected Moore, southern Oklahoma City, Midwest City, and Choctaw. A few locations in Moore and southeast Oklahoma City had also been hit by an F5 tornado that moved through the area on May 3, 1999. The General Motors Plant in southeast Oklahoma City sustained some of the most significant damage. This event was the second tornadic event of the day. Several tornadoes moved across south central Oklahoma during the early morning hours of May 8th (refer to appropriate data). This event was also the first of two days in a row where the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area was affected by tornadoes (refer to May 9, 2003 data). These thunderstorms developed near and along a strong dryline located across central Oklahoma.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the final segment of a tornado that moved east-northeast from Cleveland County, 1.5 miles west-northwest of Moore, into Oklahoma County crossing the county line at Southeast 89th Street. The western edge of the damage path along SE 89th Street was about halfway between Eastern Avenue and Bryant Avenue and the eastern edge of the damage path was just east of Bryant Avenue. As the tornado approached Sunnylane Road, it produced significant damage to a manufacturing and distribution plant just west of Sunnylane along Southeast 85th Street. Six people were in the plant when the tornado struck, but were able to seek shelter in a safe room and nobody was injured at the plant. The manufacturing part of the complex was a large, free-span structure that was destroyed. The adjoining office part of the complex to the south was a brick structure that received significant damage to the exterior walls. To the east of the plant along the east side of Sunnylane Road, a car was flipped over. Between Sunnylane Road and Sooner Road, the tornado traveled through an open area narrowly missing a residential area. But as it crossed Sooner Road, it damaged or destroyed a number of businesses including a convenience store and a bank to the south of Interstate 240.The tornado continued east-northeast crossing Interstate 240 and Southeast 74th Street. Along SE 74th, a number of businesses received significant damage including a storage facility, a boat dealership, a Mary Kay Training Center, and a trucking company.Crossing Air Depot Boulevard, the tornado moved onto the property of the General Motors Corporation Assembly Plant causing significant (F4) damage to the plant. A newly built paint shop sustained the heaviest damage exposing equipment and new production parts to the weather. The body shop, power house, and a couple of cooling tanks also sustained significant damage. The stack of one of the boilers was also sheared off. More than 600 newly assembled sport utility vehicles parked outside the plant were damaged or destroyed. Approximately 100 employee vehicles were also damaged with one compact car being flipped vertically and wedged into the side of the paint shop. Two truck drivers making deliveries to the plant sustained minor injuries. However, the more than one thousand plant employees remained uninjured by moving to shelter well before the tornado struck. The nearby United Auto Workers Union headquarters was also heavily damaged in this area.The tornado moved into the southeast section of Tinker Air Force Base, including the south part of the runway complex. An ammunition storage bunker and a guard shack at the gate near Southeast 59th Street and Douglas Boulevard were heavily damaged. The guards and other personnel were able to seek shelter in an underground shelter. After crossing Douglas Boulevard, the tornado continued to slowly veer to the northeast and damaged homes along Berryman Road. The tornado continued to damage homes and downing trees and power lines. Strong F2 to F3 damage was observed on the west side of Post Road to the south of Southeast 44th Street.A number of homes were significantly damaged or destroyed in the north part of the Kennington neighborhood, which is located southeast of Southeast 44th Street and Post Road. Two homes in the north part of the neighborhood were completely destroyed consistent with F4 damage. One of these was a two story home with no roof or walls remaining. Two cars from the garage of a residence on the west side of Kennington Lane were found about 50 yards to the east. Another home farther east was destroyed, although walls remained intact. Other homes were severely damaged. The tornado continued across SE 44th Street and Interstate 40 and went into a residential area just west of Westminister Road. Homes were damaged on Newey Avenue, Randy Street, and Rowlett Avenue with the most significant damage near the intersection of Randy Street and Rowlett Avenue where house damage consistent with an F3 rating was observed. The tornado was likely a multiple-vortex tornado in this area as some of the damage in this area was inconsistent with a single cyclonic rotation.The tornado crossed Westminister Road and damaged more homes along Burning Oaks Drive. F3 damage occurred to a few homes along Burning Oaks Drive between Westminister and Twisted Oaks Drive. To the northeast, homes in another residential area on Southeast 32nd Street were significantly damaged and a number of large trees were also downed. Damage continued to the northeast crossing Anderson Road and Southeast 29th Street moving into the city of Midwest City. There were no known structures to hit as the tornado traveled northeast from near SE 29th and Anderson Road to Hiwassee Road. Significant tree damage was observed and one structure was damaged (F1) along Hiwassee Road just to the south of Southeast 15th Street. A large number of power poles and large trees were downed along SE 15th Street to the east of Hiwassee.To the north of Southeast 15th Street, the tornado moved into the "Hidden Valley" residential area of the city of Choctaw. The only known injury in Choctaw occurred where a woman suffered a broken leg as one home on Hidden Valley Lane was destroyed (F4). Two homes under construction were also destroyed. The tornado was narrower in this area. Other homes in the neighborhood were damaged along Willow Drive, Hummingbird Drive, and Kingbird Drive. In eastern portions of the neighborhood, significant tree damage continued, although there was no significant structural damage. The tornado turned more to the east-northeast again and crossed Henney Road and approached Choctaw Road near Southeast 10th Street where more homes were damaged. The tornado weakened as it moved east-northeast and dissipated southwest of Indian Meridian Road and Reno Avenue.This tornado carved a total path of 17.3 miles moving across the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area with the most significant damage (F4) occurring in Oklahoma County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 160M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One supercell produced three tornadoes that affected Moore, southern Oklahoma City, Midwest City, and Choctaw. A few locations in Moore and southeast Oklahoma City had also been hit by an F5 tornado that moved through the area on May 3, 1999. The General Motors Plant in southeast Oklahoma City sustained some of the most significant damage. This event was the second tornadic event of the day. Several tornadoes moved across south central Oklahoma during the early morning hours of May 8th (refer to appropriate data). This event was also the first of two days in a row where the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area was affected by tornadoes (refer to May 9, 2003 data). These thunderstorms developed near and along a strong dryline located across central Oklahoma.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the final segment of a tornado that moved east-northeast from Cleveland County, 1.5 miles west-northwest of Moore, into Oklahoma County crossing the county line at Southeast 89th Street. The western edge of the damage path along SE 89th Street was about halfway between Eastern Avenue and Bryant Avenue and the eastern edge of the damage path was just east of Bryant Avenue. As the tornado approached Sunnylane Road, it produced significant damage to a manufacturing and distribution plant just west of Sunnylane along Southeast 85th Street. Six people were in the plant when the tornado struck, but were able to seek shelter in a safe room and nobody was injured at the plant. The manufacturing part of the complex was a large, free-span structure that was destroyed. The adjoining office part of the complex to the south was a brick structure that received significant damage to the exterior walls. To the east of the plant along the east side of Sunnylane Road, a car was flipped over. Between Sunnylane Road and Sooner Road, the tornado traveled through an open area narrowly missing a residential area. But as it crossed Sooner Road, it damaged or destroyed a number of businesses including a convenience store and a bank to the south of Interstate 240.The tornado continued east-northeast crossing Interstate 240 and Southeast 74th Street. Along SE 74th, a number of businesses received significant damage including a storage facility, a boat dealership, a Mary Kay Training Center, and a trucking company.Crossing Air Depot Boulevard, the tornado moved onto the property of the General Motors Corporation Assembly Plant causing significant (F4) damage to the plant. A newly built paint shop sustained the heaviest damage exposing equipment and new production parts to the weather. The body shop, power house, and a couple of cooling tanks also sustained significant damage. The stack of one of the boilers was also sheared off. More than 600 newly assembled sport utility vehicles parked outside the plant were damaged or destroyed. Approximately 100 employee vehicles were also damaged with one compact car being flipped vertically and wedged into the side of the paint shop. Two truck drivers making deliveries to the plant sustained minor injuries. However, the more than one thousand plant employees remained uninjured by moving to shelter well before the tornado struck.

Most of the tornadoes occurred after dark. Three of the tornadoes affected western and northern portions of the Oklahoma City Metropolitan area making two days in a row (see May 8, 2003 data) that the Oklahoma City metro area was affected by a tornadic thunderstorm. The strongest tornado, an F3, moved across portions of the northeastern metro area. Large hail and strong straight-line winds associated with the rear-flank downdraft also occurred with this tornadic supercell. Other severe thunderstorms produced damaging large hail and strong winds across portions of Oklahoma.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This long track tornado began 0.25 miles northeast of the intersection of North Kelly Avenue and East Wilshire Boulevard, just northeast of the KWTV-9 TV station and near the WB-34 TV station...neither tall tower was toppled. As the tornado moved northeast to Interstate 35, the width of the damage consistently was a third of a mile wide, and the maximum damage was F1 with widespread tree damage, snapped power poles, and roof damage to a number of homes south of Britton Road. The damage intensified to F2 on the west side of Interstate 35 where the roof was taken off of one wing of the Clara Waters Community Corrections Center. South of East Hefner Road and east of Interstate 35, an industrial building at a horse ranching operation sustained F3 damage. At that location, the steel frame, fastened to the concrete foundation with four one-inch diameter steel rods, was destroyed and steel reinforced concrete was pulled out of the ground. The tornado next produced F2 damage to the front portion of the Oakdale School at North Sooner Road and East Hefner Road. The Witcher Baptist Church, just south of the school, sustained F1 damage. East of Sooner Road and north of Hefner Road, the tornado weakened, producing F1 damage on the southeast side of the River Oaks Golf Club/Community. South of Northeast 122nd Street, between North Air Depot Boulevard and North Midwest Boulevard, the tornado strengthened again and the path widened to over three-quarters of a mile wide as the tornado turned more to the northeast. South of Northeast 122nd, between Midwest Boulevard and Douglas Boulevard, significant damage occurred to homes and trees. One home was completely destroyed (F3), two homes were heavily damaged (F2), and a vehicle was tossed 25 yards. The tornado turned to the southeast and damage weakened to F1 approximately 0.3 miles west of the intersection of North Post Road and Hefner Road. The tornado then turned back east-northeast causing a sheet metal hay barn to be completely blown down with hay intact. Several poles were downed towards the north, 0.25 miles west of the barn. Partial barn roof removal was found southwest of location in an open field. Another area of F1 damage began 0.3 miles north of the intersection of North 108th Street and Westminster Boulevard. A metal roof was peeled off and several tree limbs downed in this location. The tornado intensified to F2 just shortly after this, downing high tension poles 0.5 miles north of the intersection of Anderson Road and 108th Street. A farm just to the west of this location had a roof missing. The roof slid off the garage to the east. Large barn on west side lost west end of roof with debris inside. Northeast wall section of barn was essentially undamaged. A house also had shingle damage and broken windows. To the north of the farm, trees were damaged and poles were snapped.The tornado continued northeast causing the metal roof of a building, located 0.4 miles south of the intersection of Hiwassee Road and Memorial Road (North 136th Street), to peel off and be thrown 30 yards to the south. Tree damage was also found south of this location. A farm was damaged 0.8 miles south of the intersection. A barn was heavily damaged with debris thrown to the north. A pecan fork was also downed. There was also shingle damage just south of the barn. The tornado then caused damage to an outbuilding at the corner of Northeast 122nd Street and Henney Road. In an area just west of the intersection of Choctaw Road and Memorial Road, the northwest part of the roof of a house located on Spruce Valley Drive was removed, along with removing the roof of a mobile home located on Cedar Bend Road.As the tornado continued northeast, it uprooted trees and downed tree limbs. Shortly before the tornado dissipated, a mobile home rolled off of cinder blocks, but was otherwise undamaged. The tornado did some more minor tree damage before dissipating.The tornado first moved northeast causing a damage path which was located from 6.9 miles south of Edmond to 4.8 miles northwest of Jones. The tornado then turned southeast with a path from 4.8 miles northwest of Jones to 3.9 miles west-northwest of Jones. After the tornado turned back to the northeast, the path extended from 3.9 miles west-northwest of Jones to 2.8 miles south of Luther. The tornado traveled a total of 17.8 miles before dissipating.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In an area just west of the intersection of Choctaw Road and Memorial Road, the northwest part of the roof of a house located on Spruce Valley Drive was removed, along with removing the roof of a mobile home located on Cedar Bend Road.As the tornado continued northeast, it uprooted trees and downed tree limbs. Shortly before the tornado dissipated, a mobile home rolled off of cinder blocks, but was otherwise undamaged. The tornado did some more minor tree damage before dissipating.The tornado first moved northeast causing a damage path which was located from 6.9 miles south of Edmond to 4.8 miles northwest of Jones.

This was the first, organized severe weather episode in 2003 for this part of the state - a late start.  The same supercell spawned a tornado in Lafayette County, and then a short time later, another tornado in Iowa County. Refer to the individual tornado events for details.  This supercell maintained its mesocyclone circulation as it moved northeast through western Dane County to southeast Columbia County, and then across northern Dodge County.  A funnel cloud was spotted near Cross Plains (Dane Co.), but there were no additional tornado sightings other than the events in the counties of Lafayette and Iowa.  Synoptically, a line of thunderstorms moved northeast through southern Wisconsin, with a supercell forming on the left edge of the line over southeastern Grant County.  This supercell then moved northeast.  Lightning struck a home near Dane (Dane Co.) resulting in minor fire damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado spun up 5.0 miles southwest of the village Belmont (Lafayette Co.), near the intersection of Pine Tree and Field Drive, and proceeded to track northeast to near Belmont before dissipating 2.7 miles northeast of Belmont (just southeast of the intersection of Cottage Inn Road and Bethel Grove Rd).  Just east of Belmont, the tornado destroyed a farm's mobile home, injuring one of five people inside. In addition, a pole shed on this farm was damaged.  On two other farms, this tornado inflicted minor to extensive damage on homes, barns, wind mills, and decks.

This was the first, organized severe weather episode in 2003 for this part of the state - a late start.  The same supercell spawned a tornado in Lafayette County, and then a short time later, another tornado in Iowa County. Refer to the individual tornado events for details.  This supercell maintained its mesocyclone circulation as it moved northeast through western Dane County to southeast Columbia County, and then across northern Dodge County.  A funnel cloud was spotted near Cross Plains (Dane Co.), but there were no additional tornado sightings other than the events in the counties of Lafayette and Iowa.  Synoptically, a line of thunderstorms moved northeast through southern Wisconsin, with a supercell forming on the left edge of the line over southeastern Grant County.  This supercell then moved northeast.  Lightning struck a home near Dane (Dane Co.) resulting in minor fire damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado spun up 5.0 miles southwest of the village Belmont (Lafayette Co.), near the intersection of Pine Tree and Field Drive, and proceeded to track northeast to near Belmont before dissipating 2.7 miles northeast of Belmont (just southeast of the intersection of Cottage Inn Road and Bethel Grove Rd).  Just east of Belmont, the tornado destroyed a farm's mobile home, injuring one of five people inside. In addition, a pole shed on this farm was damaged.  On two other farms, this tornado inflicted minor to extensive damage on homes, barns, wind mills, and decks.  Law enforcement officials video taped this tornado; estimated at the top end of F1 (about 110 mph).<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

When it crossed the highways, 8 vehicles were damaged and one injury was sustained when a car was overturned by the tornado as it crossed I-74.  It destroyed several three story apartment buildings and severely damaged several others in the complex.  A couple of businesses in the area were destroyed as well.  It then moved through several subdivisions, damaging over 100 homes, some severely.  The tornado eventually weakened and lifted 2.5 miles north of Morton.  In all, 32 people were injured by the tornado, three seriously, but they have since recovered.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It moved east and lifted just before crossing New Jersey State Route 38. The tornado snapped large tree limbs and tossed them. A nine inch wide limb was tossed about 100 feet and struck and killed a 77-year-old woman who was about to enter her vehicle in the Holly Bowl parking lot. She suffered massive head trauma and spinal cord injuries. The same limb damaged her and two neighboring vehicles. The tornado caused small damage to the bowling alley's roof, smashed a fence and toppled a couple of light standards. It was the first tornado related death in New Jersey since August 25, 1941 in Gloucester County. The tornado was on the ground for about a half mile and its maximum path width was 30 yards. The strongest speed of the tornado was estimated at 70 mph.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It moved east and lifted just before crossing New Jersey State Route 38. The tornado snapped large tree limbs and tossed them. A nine inch wide limb was tossed about 100 feet and struck and killed a 77-year-old woman who was about to enter her vehicle in the Holly Bowl parking lot. She suffered massive head trauma and spinal cord injuries. The same limb damaged her and two neighboring vehicles. The tornado caused small damage to the bowling alley's roof, smashed a fence and toppled a couple of light standards. It was the first tornado related death in New Jersey since August 25, 1941 in Gloucester County. The tornado was on the ground for about a half mile and its maximum path width was 30 yards. The strongest speed of the tornado was estimated at 70 mph.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At the surface, a deep low pressure area moved across the eastern Great Lakes, driving a warm front across eastern New York and adjacent New England. The air became very unstable in the warm air mass behind the front. The combination of the unstable air and strong wind shear aloft, produced the most significant severe outbreak of the season across the region, and the largest tornado outbreak since May 31, 1998.   	The first line of thunderstorms worked across the region during the afternoon hours. These produced spotty wind damage, mainly downed trees and wires across portions of Albany, Greene, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga and Schoharie Counties. Torrential rains falling in a very short interval of time caused flash flooding in the city of Schenectady. North Jay Street suddenly flooded and a woman had to be rescued from her car as it became submerged in about three feet of moving water. 	An even stronger line of storms moved east from central New York, into eastern New York during the evening hours. This squall line produced wind damage of its own, with spotty downed trees and wires across portions of Albany and Washington counties. Wind damage was more concentrated in Ulster and Dutchess counties. In Saugherties, Ulster County, downed trees flattened three cars. In Dutchess County, a large swath of trees were downed in the town of East Fishkill and in the town of Tivoli, a state of emergency was declared.    	One cell broke loose from the line, and became a supercell as it reached the Mid Hudson Valley. This storm ultimately spawned a long lived significant tornado. The twister initially touched down in southeastern Greene County, and produced a  discontinous path of 17 miles in Greene County, 12.2 miles in northwestern Columbia County and 4.8 miles in southern Rensselaer County.  The tornada left a swath of destruction including hundreds, if not thousands of trees uprooted and snapped away, along with lots of power and telephone wires. Many roads in each of these counties were impassable due to debris. 	The first confirmed touchdown was in the town of Palenville, Greene County. The tornado was ranked as F1 with a 50 yard wide path and on the ground for a half mile. An unoccupied home had its siding ripped off. Several other homes were severely damaged including a trailor. The tornado next touched downed in the hamlet of Kiskatom, in the town of Catskill, where it increased to F2 intensity and cut a path 150 yards wide and over a mile long. Several homes were destroyed along with seven injuries right off Route 32 in the Brookside Camp Grounds.  Four people were trapped inside one of the trailer homes. Another lady was trapped inside a mobile home as it was lifted into the air then smashed into the ground. The woman was badly bruised but survived the ordeal. The next touchdown was in Athens with a rating of F0, and the last touchdown in Greene County was in Coaxsackie where a manufactured home was hoisted off its foundation, and had insulation pasted to the siding on the downwind side, which is typical of F1 damage.  	The tornado ripped across Columbia County with two touchdowns confirmed in the towns of Kinderhook, the Newtown Hook section in the town of Stuyvesant and the town of Niverville. The touchdown at Kinderhook Lake the strongest, with a ranking of F2. A barn was completely destroyed and the unfortunate farmer stated that some of his haywagons ended up in Kinderhook Lake. A garage was completely leveled and a car was tossed onto the tops of a blown-down tree. Another building had its metal roof partially peeled back. In Niverville, 11 people were given shelter as they were afraid to stay in their damaged homes. Straight-line thunderstorms produced additional tree and wire damage in the towns of Chatham, Hudson and Valatia. A state of emergency was declared throughout Columbia County. There was one injury reported by the newspaper in that county. The only hail reported with these storm took place in Stockpart, where golf ball size stones where reported. A state of emergency was declared in all of Columbia County right after the tornado past on by. 	The supercell and resultant tornado next touched down in the town of Nassua in Rensselaer County, near Route 20 with a rating of F1. The average width of the twister was between 75 and 100 yards and a discontinous path length of more than four miles. More homes and a garage were severly damaged but no injuries were reported. The roof on the Agway was blown off and a gazebo landed across the state highway in a  pile of splintered wood. The NWS Survey team noted that the twister had multiple vortices in this area.  Additional straight line damage was also noted in the same town. The last touchdowns were in the town of Schaghticoke with an F1 rating.  	During the height of the storms, as many as 63,000 customers were reported to have lost power in eastern New York, nearly 7,000 of those in Greene County alone. Power restoration was not completed until the following Friday.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At the surface, a deep low pressure area moved across the eastern Great Lakes, driving a warm front across eastern New York and adjacent New England. The air became very unstable in the warm air mass behind the front. The combination of the unstable air and strong wind shear aloft, produced the most significant severe outbreak of the season across the region, and the largest tornado outbreak since May 31, 1998.   	The first line of thunderstorms worked across the region during the afternoon hours. These produced spotty wind damage, mainly downed trees and wires across portions of Albany, Greene, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga and Schoharie Counties. Torrential rains falling in a very short interval of time caused flash flooding in the city of Schenectady. North Jay Street suddenly flooded and a woman had to be rescued from her car as it became submerged in about three feet of moving water. 	An even stronger line of storms moved east from central New York, into eastern New York during the evening hours. This squall line produced wind damage of its own, with spotty downed trees and wires across portions of Albany and Washington counties. Wind damage was more concentrated in Ulster and Dutchess counties. In Saugherties, Ulster County, downed trees flattened three cars. In Dutchess County, a large swath of trees were downed in the town of East Fishkill and in the town of Tivoli, a state of emergency was declared.    	One cell broke loose from the line, and became a supercell as it reached the Mid Hudson Valley. This storm ultimately spawned a long lived significant tornado. The twister initially touched down in southeastern Greene County, and produced a  discontinous path of 17 miles in Greene County, 12.2 miles in northwestern Columbia County and 4.8 miles in southern Rensselaer County.  The tornada left a swath of destruction including hundreds, if not thousands of trees uprooted and snapped away, along with lots of power and telephone wires. Many roads in each of these counties were impassable due to debris. 	The first confirmed touchdown was in the town of Palenville, Greene County. The tornado was ranked as F1 with a 50 yard wide path and on the ground for a half mile. An unoccupied home had its siding ripped off. Several other homes were severely damaged including a trailor. The tornado next touched downed in the hamlet of Kiskatom, in the town of Catskill, where it increased to F2 intensity and cut a path 150 yards wide and over a mile long. Several homes were destroyed along with seven injuries right off Route 32 in the Brookside Camp Grounds.  Four people were trapped inside one of the trailer homes. Another lady was trapped inside a mobile home as it was lifted into the air then smashed into the ground. The woman was badly bruised but survived the ordeal. The next touchdown was in Athens with a rating of F0, and the last touchdown in Greene County was in Coaxsackie where a manufactured home was hoisted off its foundation, and had insulation pasted to the siding on the downwind side, which is typical of F1 damage.  	The tornado ripped across Columbia County with two touchdowns confirmed in the towns of Kinderhook, the Newtown Hook section in the town of Stuyvesant and the town of Niverville. The touchdown at Kinderhook Lake the strongest, with a ranking of F2. A barn was completely destroyed and the unfortunate farmer stated that some of his haywagons ended up in Kinderhook Lake. A garage was completely leveled and a car was tossed onto the tops of a blown-down tree. Another building had its metal roof partially peeled back. In Niverville, 11 people were given shelter as they were afraid to stay in their damaged homes. Straight-line thunderstorms produced additional tree and wire damage in the towns of Chatham, Hudson and Valatia. A state of emergency was declared throughout Columbia County. There was one injury reported by the newspaper in that county. The only hail reported with these storm took place in Stockpart, where golf ball size stones where reported. A state of emergency was declared in all of Columbia County right after the tornado past on by. 	The supercell and resultant tornado next touched down in the town of Nassua in Rensselaer County, near Route 20 with a rating of F1. The average width of the twister was between 75 and 100 yards and a discontinous path length of more than four miles. More homes and a garage were severly damaged but no injuries were reported. The roof on the Agway was blown off and a gazebo landed across the state highway in a  pile of splintered wood. The NWS Survey team noted that the twister had multiple vortices in this area.  Additional straight line damage was also noted in the same town. The last touchdowns were in the town of Schaghticoke with an F1 rating.  	During the height of the storms, as many as 63,000 customers were reported to have lost power in eastern New York, nearly 7,000 of those in Greene County alone. Power restoration was not completed until the following Friday.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Witnesses reported a multiple vortex tornado just prior to its arrival in Granville.  The tornado hit Granville at 1647-1648 CST which coincided with the failure of the main power feed into town.  The town was bisected by the half mile wide tornado with 12 buildings destroyed, 45 with major damage, and 26 with minor damage (mainly residential).  The Granville State National Bank lost its roof and Hopkins Elementary School lost the roof over the old gymnasium with damage in nearly all the classrooms.  Significant damage also occurred to Granville Drugs, the only drug store in town.  In a strange twist of irony, the town had finally recovered from a major fire 4 years earlier that decimated much of the business district.  The tornado continued northeast out of Granville and crossed over into La Salle County (WFO LOT) at 1653 CST (2253 Z), 3.8 miles Northeast of Granville.	The Granville/Utica tornado was the first significant test of a new statewide mutual aid response agreement.  In Granville 5 people were injured by the tornado, including an eldery female who suffered a heart attack during the tornado and was eventually Life Flighted to a Peoria hospital.

As the tornado continued northeast, F2 intensity damage was done to several homes in a subdivision near the intersection of East 250th and 2569th Roads.  Several roofs were blown off homes along with damage to external walls.  Significant tree damage was done as well.  Path width was estimated at 50 yards at this location.  The tornado then continued northeast, crossing the Illinois River twice as it moved toward the town of Utica, downing a steel high tension tower on the north bank of the river, immediately west of Illinois 251.  The tornado moved into the southwest side of Utica where it was F0 intensity. Homes along Washington Street only had tree and minor roof damage. A church steeple was damaged on Division between Johnson and Washington. Roofs and trees were more severely damaged on the south side of Johnson Street. The tornado rapidly increased to F3 intensity on the north side of Johnson Street where one home had its roof taken off and north walls blown out. A machinery building was completely destroyed on the south side of the canal and a semi-tractor trailer was blown into the canal. A large grain bin was blown across the canal and flattened. The tornado then moved north of the canal into the heart of town where several homes were severely damaged, garages were destroyed and brick buildings collapsed. Eight people died and seven were rescued from the basement of a turn of the century sandstone building at Clark and Church Streets. The tornado was approximately 250 yards wide at this point.

Most of the injured were in a mobile home on the north side of U.S. Highway 60. Their mobile home was picked up and thrown into some trees. One person was critically injured. The critically injured person was paralyzed when her back and neck was broken, and she was airlifted to a St. Louis area hospital. Another person received a broken arm, and most of the remaining injuries were scrapes and cuts. The tornado destroyed a total of three mobile homes, a storage facility, and numerous sheds. Two homes and one business were severely damaged. Numerous vehicles were damaged.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 600K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At least two supercell storms produced giant hail and one strong tornado over the region.A supercell thunderstorm tracked across Terrell County in the west Texas Lower Trans Pecos region during the late afternoon hours. Multiple reports of large hail including two different instances of tennis ball sized stones were received as this storm tracked east along U.S. Highway 90 between Sanderson and Dryden.A second area of convection erupted over the eastern Permian Basin by late afternoon and continued into the evening hours. A severe storm associated with this activity produced half-dollar size hail in the Westbrook community. An isolated classic supercell evolved from this complex of storms and took on a distinctly deviant southeastward storm motion. This storm took on radar characteristics consistent with a classic tornadic supercell. Hail up to the size of golfballs was observed southeast of Colorado City as the storm evolved into its tornadic phase. A long-lived significant tornado tracked across mainly rural areas of Mitchell County just after sunset. The tornado resulted in three injuries when it crossed State Route 208 and blew a vehicle off of the highway. Severe rear flank downdraft winds also resulted in widespread wind damage south of the tornado's path.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service damage survey team concluded that a significant tornado struck rural areas of southeastern Mitchell County during the evening of the 11th. The team examined a damage path marked by shredded vegetation (mostly mesquite trees),  downed utility poles, agricultural fences, and a complex of destroyed mobile homes that extended over ten miles in a continuous horseshoe shaped path that crossed State Route 208 twenty miles south-southeast of Colorado City.The tornado developed seventeen miles south-southeast of Colorado City around 2028 CST. Damage indicates the tornado's motion was initially toward the southeast then east as it crossed the heavily traveled State Route 208. Two Texas Tech University students traveling north on 208 (south of the tornado's path) watched as a Ford Expedition drove into the tornadic circulation. The large sports utility vehicle was blown 100 yards off of the highway. Evidence supports the vehicle was rolled a considerable distance by the tornadic winds, but it is unclear whether it became airborne. Three motorists were transferred to local hospitals. One person sustained serious injuries that included a broken back.A detailed damage path analysis and corresponding radar data suggest that the tornado then tracked very slowly east a few miles before curving to the northeast. Similar curved damage paths (turning left of the tornado's original motion) are commonly observed when well-developed tornadoes enter the dissipation stage.

At least two supercell storms produced giant hail and one strong tornado over the region.A supercell thunderstorm tracked across Terrell County in the west Texas Lower Trans Pecos region during the late afternoon hours. Multiple reports of large hail including two different instances of tennis ball sized stones were received as this storm tracked east along U.S. Highway 90 between Sanderson and Dryden.A second area of convection erupted over the eastern Permian Basin by late afternoon and continued into the evening hours. A severe storm associated with this activity produced half-dollar size hail in the Westbrook community. An isolated classic supercell evolved from this complex of storms and took on a distinctly deviant southeastward storm motion. This storm took on radar characteristics consistent with a classic tornadic supercell. Hail up to the size of golfballs was observed southeast of Colorado City as the storm evolved into its tornadic phase. A long-lived significant tornado tracked across mainly rural areas of Mitchell County just after sunset. The tornado resulted in three injuries when it crossed State Route 208 and blew a vehicle off of the highway. Severe rear flank downdraft winds also resulted in widespread wind damage south of the tornado's path.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service damage survey team concluded that a significant tornado struck rural areas of southeastern Mitchell County during the evening of the 11th. The team examined a damage path marked by shredded vegetation (mostly mesquite trees),  downed utility poles, agricultural fences, and a complex of destroyed mobile homes that extended over ten miles in a continuous horseshoe shaped path that crossed State Route 208 twenty miles south-southeast of Colorado City.The tornado developed seventeen miles south-southeast of Colorado City around 2028 CST. Damage indicates the tornado's motion was initially toward the southeast then east as it crossed the heavily traveled State Route 208. Two Texas Tech University students traveling north on 208 (south of the tornado's path) watched as a Ford Expedition drove into the tornadic circulation. The large sports utility vehicle was blown 100 yards off of the highway. Evidence supports the vehicle was rolled a considerable distance by the tornadic winds, but it is unclear whether it became airborne. Three motorists were transferred to local hospitals. One person sustained serious injuries that included a broken back.A detailed damage path analysis and corresponding radar data suggest that the tornado then tracked very slowly east a few miles before curving to the northeast. Similar curved damage paths (turning left of the tornado's original motion) are commonly observed when well-developed tornadoes enter the dissipation stage. The tornado proved to remain very dangerous, however, as eight mobile homes were destroyed by the tornado near the end of its life cycle twenty miles southeast of Colorado City. The light weight and unanchored structures were blown over and shredded by the dissipation stage tornadic winds. The trailers were arranged in a complex and were used to provide shelter for groups of hunters that frequent the ranch property. They were not occupied when the tornado struck.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It initially touched down 3 miles west of Daykin in northern Jefferson county.  The tornado was rated an f0 or f1 in Jefferson county damaging farm outbuildings, grain bins and trees. From there the tornado crossed into Saline county southwest of Western and remained an f0 or f1 until it struck the southern portion of Wilber where it strengthened to f2. Roofs were blown off of homes just southeast of Wilber.The tornado traveled from Wilber into Gage county, crossing the county line west of Clatonia where it grew to its most intense stage, f4.  The tornado remained nearly at this strength as it crossed into Lancaster county near Hallam with a damage path of around 2 1/2 miles.  Many well-built homes were demolished from Clatonia to Hallam, along with grain bins, farm sheds, and outbuildings.  Many trees were destroyed or uprooted.  Although Hallam itself escaped the strongest winds from the storm, which occurred just south of town, 95 percent of the buildings in town were either destroyed or severely damaged.  The lone fatality from the tornado occurred in Hallam.  The storm also toppled several hopper cars from a freight train on the west edge of town.  In total 55 railroad cars were derailed.From Hallam the tornado traveled east for several miles prior to turning northeast again just north of Cortland. The storm then tracked 2 miles north of Firth, severely damaging the Firth-Norris high school and a nearby middle school.  School busses were tossed in this area.  Several homes northeast of the schools were flattened as the tornado regained its f4 strength.The damage path continued northeast to Holland and then to 2 miles north of Panama where the tornado weakened to around an f2 and the damage path began to narrow.  The track then curved more toward the north, passing just south of Bennet where a few homes sustained f3 damage.  After passing south of Bennet, the storm moved back to the northeast and began to weaken to f0 or f1 strength as it crossed into Otoe county southwest of Palmyra.  The tornado finally dissipated 1 miles west southwest of Palmyra.In total the tornado was on the ground for around 54 miles with a maximum intensity of f4.  Besides the fatality, 38 people sustained injuries, 158 homes were leveled and 57 others were seriously damaged. The dollar amount of damage was estimated at 160 million, with 60 million of that agricultural including 100 cattle and 50 hogs lost.  Some 150,000 acres of crop land sustained significant damage.

At the surface a warm frontal boundary extended nearly east to west across the state and provided the focus for thunderstorm development.  By the late afternoon, lifted indices were approaching -10 C. with CAPE values around 5000 J/kg over western Iowa.  Surface temperatures warmed into the upper 80s with dew points in the low to mid 70s.  A southwest surface wind of 15 to 25 kts pushed over the front.  Northeast of the frontal boundary winds were easterly around 10 to 15 kts.  Actually, the surface boundary was further enhanced by outflow from convective complexes during the day, further sharpening the contrast.  Thunderstorms continued to fire along and north of the boundary through the afternoon and into the evening.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding as very heavy rains fell on areas that had had significant rainfall the previous night.  There were reports in north central into northeast Iowa of 2 to 4 inches of rainfall in a little more than an hours time.  Major flooding took place in the Mason City area where evacuations were taking place.  The thunderstorms became most intense during the afternoon into the early evening.  There were several tornadoes across northeast into north central Iowa.  Most were relatively brief touchdowns and were in open areas.  Reports of multi-vortex tornadoes were received from Grundy County.  The days most significant tornado touched down in Pocahontas County east of Rolfe and tracked into Humboldt County through the Bradgate area.  The tornado damaged or destroyed over 75% of the town of Bradgate (pop 120).  Tornado damage in Bradgate was very extensive impacting most of the town.  Hardly a building was not impacted.   Outbuildings, light structures and garages were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Two homes were destroyed.  Several homes were damaged ranging from minor to extensive.  The Survey Team found that the majority of the damage was F1, with a few cases of F2 damage.  The F2 damage was to the snapping of very large trees just west of town and the structural damage to two buildings.  Nearly all of the 53 homes there reported damage with several totally destroyed.  Significant widespread property damage was reported in the tornadoes path.  There were several injuries in the town, the most significant being a broken leg.  A police officer was reportedly hit by debris from the tornado and suffered a broken leg.  According to law officials, the damage path of the tornado was 2 miles wide and about 8 miles long.  Storm chasers on the scene reported the tornado itself to be one half mile wide at one point.  Reports of hail were numerous through the afternoon and evening.  Most of the hail was in the three quarter inch to one inch diameter range.  There were a few reports of golf ball size hail from the stronger storms.  Winds were not a major problem with the activity.  There were spotty reports of winds to around 60 MPH, but most reports were in the 40 to 50 MPH range.  One of the stronger wind reports was a 64 MPH wind gust in Tripoli in Bremer County.  This gust was measured by a mesonet station there.  During the mid evening hours, thunderstorms rumbled across Grundy County.  Lightning struck the Sheriff's office there and destroyed a significant amount of office equipment.  Damage was reported around $100,000.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Tornado intensified as it approached Bradgate.

At the surface a warm frontal boundary extended nearly east to west across the state and provided the focus for thunderstorm development.  By the late afternoon, lifted indices were approaching -10 C. with CAPE values around 5000 J/kg over western Iowa.  Surface temperatures warmed into the upper 80s with dew points in the low to mid 70s.  A southwest surface wind of 15 to 25 kts pushed over the front.  Northeast of the frontal boundary winds were easterly around 10 to 15 kts.  Actually, the surface boundary was further enhanced by outflow from convective complexes during the day, further sharpening the contrast.  Thunderstorms continued to fire along and north of the boundary through the afternoon and into the evening.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding as very heavy rains fell on areas that had had significant rainfall the previous night.  There were reports in north central into northeast Iowa of 2 to 4 inches of rainfall in a little more than an hours time.

The first tornado touched down  about 1.5 miles north of Taylor (Jackson County) around 6:22 p.m.  It caused intermittent damage during the first two miles of its path as it moved east southeastward across Highway 95.  It then strengthened and stayed on the ground for another 3 miles.  Many trees were knocked down, and it also demolished a garage and took the roof off two other structures. The tornado reached F1 strength (estimated 75-85 mph winds) briefly as it moved through the Davis and Taylor Road areas where it demolished a garage approximately 2 miles northeast of Taylor. This tornado appeared to lift approximately 4 miles east of Taylor around 6:28 p.m. About 3 tenths of a mile to the south of where the first tornado lifted, a second tornado formed. This tornado primarily caused tree damage. Shortly after formation, it reached F1 strength (estimated 80-100 mph winds), clearing out a path about 30 yards wide through a wooded area just north of West Pine Creek Road. This tornado weakened about 5 miles east of Taylor, but caused sporadic F0 damage until it finally lifted around 6:32 p.m. about 8 miles east of Taylor in the East Pine Creek Road area.  Total path length of these two tornadoes was nearly 9 miles. They were on the ground for about 10 minutes. A third tornado quickly developed about 3 miles west of Warrens (Monroe County) near Arctic Road, just west of Interstate 94 around 7:00 p.m.  It hit a home along Interstate 94, then crossed the Interstate hitting a semi-truck, before moving into Jellystone Campground just west of Warrens.  The tornado and associated strong winds around the storm knocked down hundreds of trees in this area, and damaged several tents, buildings, campers, and cars in Jellystone Campground.  One gentleman was seriously injured when a tree fell on him during a rescue attempt.  He was in a coma for a period of time, but survived with lasting disabilities.  The tornado continued just southwest of Warrens and hit a home, blowing the roof off, south of the village along County Road O.  It lifted about 2 miles southeast of Warrens around 7:12 p.m.  The tornado path was approximately 4.5 miles in total length, with a maximum width of 50 yards. The tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Damage Scale. Wind speeds were likely 90 to 112 mph, with most of the damage related to downburst winds around the actual tornado.  At least 3 people were hospitalized briefly for injuries, but there no fatalities. The fourth tornado formed in extreme eastern Juneau County, about 2 miles west of Castle Rock Dam. The tornado moved east-northeast across Castle Rock Lake and into western Adams County.  It tracked near or along Edgewood Ave, with extensive tree damage to the Quincy Bluff area, including the lookout ranger tower there. Hundreds of trees were blown down from strong winds rotating around the tornadic thunderstorm, which were in excess of 90 mph at times.  The tornado intermittently tracked east to areas just north of Edgewood Drive crossing Highway 13 approximately 5 miles south of Adams/Friendship (Adams County).  Downburst winds on the south side of the storm demolished at least 8 mobile homes in Edgewood Estates that were orientated north-south and took the full brunt of the cross wind.  This was the same area hit by severe weather in September 2000.  Most of the Town of Easton (Adams County) had extensive damage with hundreds of trees down.  It continued to move east-southeast before lifting shortly before the Adams-Marquette County line about 3 miles southeast of Grand Marsh around 7:55 pm.  A broad area of straight line wind damage was found south of this tornado track with widespread tree damage occurring up to 1 mile south of the track.  The tornado path was approximately 17 to 18 miles in length. The tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Damage Scale with estimated wind speeds in the 73 to 112 mph range.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This tornado weakened about 5 miles east of Taylor, but caused sporadic F0 damage until it finally lifted around 6:32 p.m. about 8 miles east of Taylor in the East Pine Creek Road area.  Total path length of these two tornadoes was nearly 9 miles. They were on the ground for about 10 minutes. A third tornado quickly developed about 3 miles west of Warrens (Monroe County) near Arctic Road, just west of Interstate 94 around 7:00 p.m.  It hit a home along Interstate 94, then crossed the Interstate hitting a semi-truck, before moving into Jellystone Campground just west of Warrens.  The tornado and associated strong winds around the storm knocked down hundreds of trees in this area, and damaged several tents, buildings, campers, and cars in Jellystone Campground.  One gentleman was seriously injured when a tree fell on him during a rescue attempt.  He was in a coma for a period of time, but survived with lasting disabilities.  The tornado continued just southwest of Warrens and hit a home, blowing the roof off, south of the village along County Road O.  It lifted about 2 miles southeast of Warrens around 7:12 p.m.  The tornado path was approximately 4.5 miles in total length, with a maximum width of 50 yards. The tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Damage Scale. Wind speeds were likely 90 to 112 mph, with most of the damage related to downburst winds around the actual tornado.  At least 3 people were hospitalized briefly for injuries, but there no fatalities. The fourth tornado formed in extreme eastern Juneau County, about 2 miles west of Castle Rock Dam. The tornado moved east-northeast across Castle Rock Lake and into western Adams County.  It tracked near or along Edgewood Ave, with extensive tree damage to the Quincy Bluff area, including the lookout ranger tower there. Hundreds of trees were blown down from strong winds rotating around the tornadic thunderstorm, which were in excess of 90 mph at times.  The tornado intermittently tracked east to areas just north of Edgewood Drive crossing Highway 13 approximately 5 miles south of Adams/Friendship (Adams County).  Downburst winds on the south side of the storm demolished at least 8 mobile homes in Edgewood Estates that were orientated north-south and took the full brunt of the cross wind.  This was the same area hit by severe weather in September 2000.  Most of the Town of Easton (Adams County) had extensive damage with hundreds of trees down.  It continued to move east-southeast before lifting shortly before the Adams-Marquette County line about 3 miles southeast of Grand Marsh around 7:55 pm.  A broad area of straight line wind damage was found south of this tornado track with widespread tree damage occurring up to 1 mile south of the track.  The tornado path was approximately 17 to 18 miles in length. The tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Damage Scale with estimated wind speeds in the 73 to 112 mph range.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado traveled southeast for about 2.5 miles, before beginning a temporary eastward jog between county roads 1300E and 1400E. The tornado curved southeast again, striking the Parsons Company, Inc.'s manufacturing plant around 241 pm CDT.  The plant was severely damaged by the tornado.  Approximately 140 people were in the plant at the time, but all personnel made it to storm shelters in time (approximately 3 to 5 minutes before the tornado arrived).  Steel beams and metal siding from the plant were found approximately three quarters of a mile east in a farm field. From the plant, the tornado continued east, just south of Illinois Route 116/117, affecting 4 farmsteads approximately 1/2 to 1 mile east of the plant.  Two of the farmsteads closest to the plant (about 1/2 to 3/4 mile east) had the 2-story houses completely blown away, with only debris remaining in the basements and nearby property.  The other two farmsteads had significant damage to the 2-story houses with outbuildings demolished.  The center of the tornado tracked about 100 yards south of the houses located on the south side of the road.From the plant to the farmsteads, the average width of the tornado was 400 yards and was close to 1/4 mile wide at times.  The greatest tornado intensity was during this approximately 1 mile stretch and has been rated F4 by the National Weather Service.At this point, the tornado began to move more east-southeast and caused significant damage to a barn near the intersection of County Roads 1300N and 1600E, about 2.5 miles southwest of Roanoke. The tornado continued to move east-southeast and damaged a house about 1.25 miles south-southwest of Roanoke, near the intersection of County Roads 1300N and 1700E.  The tornado crossed 1300N shortly afterward and curved sharply to the southeast. The tornado lifted around 254 pm about 2 miles southeast of Roanoke, at County Road 1900E.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A large corrugated metal workshop on the south side of FM 485 had the roof blown into some trees, and the walls blown down.  The fatality occurred in this building.

A warm front moving north through the area resulted in favorable vertical wind shear to allow for supercell development.The 1st round of severe weather was due to a broken line of intense thunderstorms moving  across Walworth, Milwaukee, Racine and Kenosha counties.  Hail of up to 1 inch in diameter and torrential rainfall accompanied these storms before they moved over Lake Michigan and weakened.  The 2nd round of severe weather was dominated by 2 cyclic supercells - one moved east/southeast through Marquette, Green Lake, Fond du Lac, and Washington Counties, spinning up 5 separate tornadoes, dumping hail stones up to 3 inches in diameter, and hurricane-force downburst winds.  The large hail dented several vehicles.  Two of these were rated F3.  Refer to the individual tornado reports for more details.  A more southerly supercell tracked across extreme southern Sauk County and then made a partial right turn and headed southeast through Dane County, spinning up 2 tornadoes in the process, as well as large hail and downburst winds.  One powerful downburst wind in Madison (Dane Co.) blew equipment off the roof of a business at the Midvale Shopping Mall.  A semi southwest of Ft. Atkinson was blown over by straight-line wind gusts.  This southern supercell eventually spun up another tornado in south-central Jefferson County which moved into north-central Walworth County.  Refer to the individual tornado reports for more details.Both supercells had downbursts that generated large hail and powerful, hurricane-force winds north and south of their tracks.  Over all of Wisconsin, 16 tornadoes were documented on June 23rd, which is the 4th highest single-day total (record is 24 on May 8, 1988).

Byrne State Forest. The Development Center is a state run home for about 500 developmentally disabled adults. The tornado touched down in a wooded area about one mile south of the intersections of State Routes 70 and 72. A second much smaller and weaker funnel also briefly touched down in that area. The tornado proceeded east through the New Lisbon Development Center where all the property damage and injuries occurred and crossed State Route 72 into the Brendan Byrne State Forest. Two staff members (male and female) were injured. The male was injured when the van he was in was overturned by the tornado. The female was injured when flying glass and debris shattered the windows of the separate vehicle she was in on State Route 72. A thrift store on campus was destroyed and several apartments in the same attached building was also destroyed. None of the residents were injured. The roof and walls from the thrift shop were tossed more than one hundred yards. A metal bench was found in a tree. The tornado also badly damaged the administration center building. A tractor-trailer used for storage near the thrift shop was found in the woods. Several vehicles were overturned. The tornado uprooted and snapped trees, bent bird cage poles and ripped light poles from the ground. One-hundred-year-old trees were snapped. The tornado then proceeded into the Brendan Byrne State Forest where approximately 350 acres of trees were damaged or destroyed. Several hiking trails were closed through the 31st until the debris was cleared. The tornado lifted in the forest, but debris from it fell in Manchester Township in adjacent Ocean County. New Jersey State Route 72 was closed through the night and about 100 people lost power. The tornado was rate an F1 with maximum winds estimated at the high end of the scale, approximately 110 miles an hour. The tornado remained on the ground for about 2.6 miles and its path width was around 100 yards.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado continued to snap and uproot large trees as it moved toward Welcome Church Rd, where 4 mobile homes were damaged and a frame home received minor roof damage. The damage path continued northeast, but ended about 200 yards north of highway 14. After briefly lifting, the tornado struck a tire distribution center just north of the highway 221 I-385 exchange. The roof of a building at the plant was damaged, which sparked a large fire in the building, burning it to the ground. An employee at the plant received minor injuries when debris fell on him. The tornado dissipated near highway 221 north of Laurens.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Sixteen tornadoes were documented on this day in south-central and southeast Wisconsin, a new single-day record.  A line of supercells developed and pushed across south-central Wisconsin during the afternoon hours, and then pushed east across southeast Wisconsin during the evening hours.   Most of the tornadoes were associated with two supercells.  One main supercell tracked across Sauk County and then into Columbia, producing one F0 and one F2 tornado.  The F2 tornado crossed into Columbia County.  Another main supercell produced an F3 tornado that devastated the area north of city of Stoughton (Dane Co.), and a weaker F1 tornado just south of the city of Rockdale (Dane Co.).  This supercell then tracked into southwestern Jefferson County a short time later, producing two F0 tornadoes and four F1 tornadoes.  The sixteen (16) tornadoes contributed largely to both the new state record of 27 tornadoes on a single day, and 62 tornadoes for a calendar year.  In additiion, there were scattered reports of funnel clouds, damaging straight-line, downburst winds, and large hail across south-central and southeast Wisconsin.  The total direct damage estimate for the afternoon and evening tornado and severe weather outbreak in south-central and southeast Wisconsin on August 18th was about $36.6 M ($35.7 property and $948 K crop).  Additional indirect costs totaled almost $1.9 M, resulting in a total direct and direct cost of about $38.5 M. Synoptically, a surface low pressure system was located over extreme southeast Minnesota early in the afternoon.  A warm front extended east southeast from the low with dew points pooling in the lower 70s along it.  The surface low moved east into east central Wisconsin by 2100CST that evening.  Favorable wind shear associated with the warm front, combined with the strong instability supplied by the heat and humidity, helped to produce numerous tornadic supercells.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A strong and destructive tornado spun up at 1715CST about 2.8 miles southeast of the geographic center of Fitchburg (or 2.0 miles north of center of Oregon), about 400 yards southwest of the intersection of CTH MM and Schnieder Rd.  It continued east-southeast to the southern edge of Lake Kegonsa and tore through residential neighborhoods about 1/3 to 1/2 mile north of CTH B (Civil Towns of Dunn and Pleasant Springs, and far-northern Stoughton).  It moved over the crossing of CTH A with Interstate 90/39, and stayed close to CTH A to its exit point at 1905CST where CTH A crosses into Jefferson County, about 2.8 miles south-southwest of Rockdale.  One person was crushed to death in their basement from fireplace and chimney bricks that crashed through the floor.  Twenty-three (23) other people were directly injured.  In addition, Emergency Management officials received reports of 2 other indirectly-related deaths associated with this strong tornado.  In these two cases, the people were already very ill or suffering from a life-ending  disease.  Injuries they received during the tornado contributed (secondary) to their death, but were not the primary cause of death, based on medical examiner reports.  Consequently, these additional two deaths do not appear in the official death tally in the header strip of this event.  Numerous homes, businesses, farm buildings, vehicles, power-lines, trees, and other personal effects were either damaged or destroyed along its path that grew to a maximum width of about 600 yards north of Stoughton.  As for residential structures, 220 sustained minor damage, 84 had major damage, and 69 were destroyed.  As for business structures, 6 sustained minor damage, 1 had major damage, and 1 was destroyed.  As for agricultural structures, 5 sustained minor damage, 5 had major damage, and 40 were destroyed.  Total estimated damage amounts (directly-related) for private and public sectors combined was $35.06 M, broken down to $34.31 M in property damage and $750 K in crop losses, for the tornado segment in Dane County.  This tornado was probably the 3rd most costly tornado in Wisconsin's recorded history (1996 Oakfield tornado and 1984 Barneveld tornadoes were more costly). The $34.31 M in property damage was broken down to private losses (total of 32.29 M) and public losses (total of $2.02 M), per Emergency Manager reports and NWS estimates.  The private losses included a total of $25.45 M for residential structures, $1.29 M for businesses, $4.25 M for agricultural structures, $1.00 M for damage to vehicles, boats, and other personal effects, $200 K to agricultural machinery and tools, and $96 K in public road system damage.  The public losses making up part of the $34.31 M consisted of $2.02 M in damage to public utility systems.  The $750 K in damage attributed to crop losses occurred on an estimated 1,550 acres of land.  Additional monetary costs incurred in the public sector (totaling $1.84 M) which are considered indirectly-related damage expenses, and not included in the "direct" totals listed in the header-strip of this event, include: $1.38 M in debris clearance, $308 K in protective measures, and miscellaneous damage/expenses of $144 K.  Therefore, the grand total of direct and indirect damage amounts and expenses attributed to this tornado segment in Dane county totaled about $36.89 M.Just south of the tornado, extending out another mile or so, tree and power-line damage resulted from rear-flank downdraft damage - in some cases south to STH 51.  This damage is separate from tornado damage, and isn't included in the numbers in previous sentences.  Debris from this tornado was lofted by the parent's updraft and carried downstream to scattered locations in the counties of Jefferson, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Walworth, Racine, and Kenosha.  This tornado was extensively photographed and video-taped by storm spotters (amateur radio operators, etc.), storm chasers, and private citizens.  On occasions, this tornado displayed multiple-vortex characteristics.  Due to partial back-building (to the west-southwest) of the supercell's updraft tower, this tornado moved slowly, and was described by some eyewitnesses and spotters as being nearly stationary at times north of Stoughton.  The overall slow movement (supercell moved at 12-17 knots, or 10-15 mph), coupled with structures that were not thoroughly reinforced (based on NWS damage survey), allowed the tornado's cyclonic winds to more severely damage buildings in its path.  Consequently, although some of the worst damage resembled what would be left by a F4 tornado for well-built homes, this tornado was rated at the top of the F3 category with estimated winds near 174 knots (200 mph).  The F3 category has estimated wind speeds of 137-179 knots (158-206 mph).  A sampling of newspaper headlines and personal quotes included: "The Sky Just Exploded,"  "Hard to Believe There Weren't More Deaths," "New Technology Lowers Tornado Deaths,"  "Counting Losses, Blessings," "It Was Probably The Most Intense Storm In The Country This Year," "It's a Mess Out Here," and "I've Never Experienced Anything Like This."  The tornado cut electrical power for 1700 customers in the Stoughton area.  The estimated average path length was about 175 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 34.31M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Sixteen tornadoes were documented on this day in south-central and southeast Wisconsin, a new single-day record.  A line of supercells developed and pushed across south-central Wisconsin during the afternoon hours, and then pushed east across southeast Wisconsin during the evening hours.   Most of the tornadoes were associated with two supercells.  One main supercell tracked across Sauk County and then into Columbia, producing one F0 and one F2 tornado.  The F2 tornado crossed into Columbia County.  Another main supercell produced an F3 tornado that devastated the area north of city of Stoughton (Dane Co.), and a weaker F1 tornado just south of the city of Rockdale (Dane Co.).  This supercell then tracked into southwestern Jefferson County a short time later, producing two F0 tornadoes and four F1 tornadoes.  The sixteen (16) tornadoes contributed largely to both the new state record of 27 tornadoes on a single day, and 62 tornadoes for a calendar year.  In additiion, there were scattered reports of funnel clouds, damaging straight-line, downburst winds, and large hail across south-central and southeast Wisconsin.  The total direct damage estimate for the afternoon and evening tornado and severe weather outbreak in south-central and southeast Wisconsin on August 18th was about $36.6 M ($35.7 property and $948 K crop).  Additional indirect costs totaled almost $1.9 M, resulting in a total direct and direct cost of about $38.5 M. Synoptically, a surface low pressure system was located over extreme southeast Minnesota early in the afternoon.  A warm front extended east southeast from the low with dew points pooling in the lower 70s along it.  The surface low moved east into east central Wisconsin by 2100CST that evening.  Favorable wind shear associated with the warm front, combined with the strong instability supplied by the heat and humidity, helped to produce numerous tornadic supercells.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A strong and destructive tornado spun up at 1715CST about 2.8 miles southeast of the geographic center of Fitchburg (or 2.0 miles north of center of Oregon), about 400 yards southwest of the intersection of CTH MM and Schnieder Rd.  It continued east-southeast to the southern edge of Lake Kegonsa and tore through residential neighborhoods about 1/3 to 1/2 mile north of CTH B (Civil Towns of Dunn and Pleasant Springs, and far-northern Stoughton).  It moved over the crossing of CTH A with Interstate 90/39, and stayed close to CTH A to its exit point at 1905CST where CTH A crosses into Jefferson County, about 2.8 miles south-southwest of Rockdale.  One person was crushed to death in their basement from fireplace and chimney bricks that crashed through the floor.  Twenty-three (23) other people were directly injured.  In addition, Emergency Management officials received reports of 2 other indirectly-related deaths associated with this strong tornado.  In these two cases, the people were already very ill or suffering from a life-ending  disease.  Injuries they received during the tornado contributed (secondary) to their death, but were not the primary cause of death, based on medical examiner reports.  Consequently, these additional two deaths do not appear in the official death tally in the header strip of this event.  Numerous homes, businesses, farm buildings, vehicles, power-lines, trees, and other personal effects were either damaged or destroyed along its path that grew to a maximum width of about 600 yards north of Stoughton.  As for residential structures, 220 sustained minor damage, 84 had major damage, and 69 were destroyed.  As for business structures, 6 sustained minor damage, 1 had major damage, and 1 was destroyed.  As for agricultural structures, 5 sustained minor damage, 5 had major damage, and 40 were destroyed.  Total estimated damage amounts (directly-related) for private and public sectors combined was $35.06 M, broken down to $34.31 M in property damage and $750 K in crop losses, for the tornado segment in Dane County.  This tornado was probably the 3rd most costly tornado in Wisconsin's recorded history (1996 Oakfield tornado and 1984 Barneveld tornadoes were more costly). The $34.31 M in property damage was broken down to private losses (total of 32.29 M) and public losses (total of $2.02 M), per Emergency Manager reports and NWS estimates.  The private losses included a total of $25.45 M for residential structures, $1.29 M for businesses, $4.25 M for agricultural structures, $1.00 M for damage to vehicles, boats, and other personal effects, $200 K to agricultural machinery and tools, and $96 K in public road system damage.  The public losses making up part of the $34.31 M consisted of $2.02 M in damage to public utility systems.  The $750 K in damage attributed to crop losses occurred on an estimated 1,550 acres of land.  Additional monetary costs incurred in the public sector (totaling $1.84 M) which are considered indirectly-related damage expenses, and not included in the "direct" totals listed in the header-strip of this event, include: $1.38 M in debris clearance, $308 K in protective measures, and miscellaneous damage/expenses of $144 K.  Therefore, the grand total of direct and indirect damage amounts and expenses attributed to this tornado segment in Dane county totaled about $36.89 M.Just south of the tornado, extending out another mile or so, tree and power-line damage resulted from rear-flank downdraft damage - in some cases south to STH 51.  This damage is separate from tornado damage, and isn't included in the numbers in previous sentences.  Debris from this tornado was lofted by the parent's updraft and carried downstream to scattered locations in the counties of Jefferson, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Walworth, Racine, and Kenosha.  This tornado was extensively photographed and video-taped by storm spotters (amateur radio operators, etc.), storm chasers, and private citizens.  On occasions, this tornado displayed multiple-vortex characteristics.  Due to partial back-building (to the west-southwest) of the supercell's updraft tower, this tornado moved slowly, and was described by some eyewitnesses and spotters as being nearly stationary at times north of Stoughton.  The overall slow movement (supercell moved at 12-17 knots, or 10-15 mph), coupled with structures that were not thoroughly reinforced (based on NWS damage survey), allowed the tornado's cyclonic winds to more severely damage buildings in its path.  Consequently, although some of the worst damage resembled what would be left by a F4 tornado for well-built homes, this tornado was rated at the top of the F3 category with estimated winds near 174 knots (200 mph).  The F3 category has estimated wind speeds of 137-179 knots (158-206 mph).  A sampling of newspaper headlines and personal quotes included: "The Sky Just Exploded,"  "Hard to Believe There Weren't More Deaths," "New Technology Lowers Tornado Deaths,"  "Counting Losses, Blessings," "It Was Probably The Most Intense Storm In The Country This Year," "It's a Mess Out Here," and "I've Never Experienced Anything Like This."  The tornado cut electrical power for 1700 customers in the Stoughton area.  The estimated average path length was about 175 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 34.31M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Three mobile homes were totally destroyed, two mobile homes suffered major damage, and at least 4 others sustained minor damage on McAllister Road. Two male occupants of a mobile home were injured when the high winds demolished the home. One man was hospitalized. The tornado continued northeastward and crossed County Road 140, US Highway 82 and County Road 21. Several more structures sustained minor roof damage along the path.

The first tornado touched down briefly just west of Centerville (Trempealeau County). The only damage reported with this tornado was several trees knocked down just north of Highway 35 along County Road G.  A second and stronger tornado occurred just north of County Highway KK, or just west of Esofea (Vernon County).  There was tree, agricultural and structural damage.  A moblie home, which was on cement blocks, was completely destroyed.  The occupant of the mobile home was taken to a hospital with minor injuries.  Another residence sustained minor damage, with windows blown out, outbuildings destroyed and a car turned 90 degrees.  Power poles were snapped, corn was flattened and there was significant tree damage.  The third and strongest tornado touched down just west of Liberty (Vernon County), then tracked along a continous path just north of Highway 56, to the northern most block of the town of Viola (Richland County).  Three people were reported injured in Viola and almost every tree in the town was damaged or downed.  Most homes in the village had at least minor damage, while a few sustained major damage, including roofs blown off.  Many garages facing west or southwest were destroyed by the direct impact of the winds.  Wind speeds associated with the tornado were estimated at 100 to 120 mph.  The tornado path became more sporadic as it moved east of Viola across northern Richland County.  The damage path extended from just north of County Highway MM and Highway 56 into Bloom City (Richland County), which apparently took a direct hit from the storm.  The tornado continued on an east-southeast track, before lifting just west of Hub City (Richland County).  A fourth tornado touched down along County Road N, or just east of the location where Interstate 90 and 94 split in eastern Monroe County.  This tornado continued on a 10 mile track into Juneau County, ending just west of the Necedah Wildlife Refuge Headquarters.  There was tree, agricultural and structural damage.  A home, which was under construction, was completely destroyed.  Three other homes sustained minor damage.  Corn was flattened and there was significant tree damage as well.  A fifth tornado touched down in the town of Muscoda (Grant County) causing minor damage to homes, but knocking down or shearing off numerous trees.  This tornado crossed the Wisconsin River into the small community of Orion (Richland County).  Several mobile homes were damaged, including several reportedly tossed into the air.  Many trees were damaged there as well.  The sixth and final tornado briefly touched down near the intersection of Highway 82 and 13 in Adams County.  Mobile homes were damaged, along with nearby trees.  Richland and Vernon County were declared federal disaster areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first tornado touched down briefly just west of Centerville (Trempealeau County). The only damage reported with this tornado was several trees knocked down just north of Highway 35 along County Road G.  A second and stronger tornado occurred just north of County Highway KK, or just west of Esofea (Vernon County).  There was tree, agricultural and structural damage.  A moblie home, which was on cement blocks, was completely destroyed.  The occupant of the mobile home was taken to a hospital with minor injuries.  Another residence sustained minor damage, with windows blown out, outbuildings destroyed and a car turned 90 degrees.  Power poles were snapped, corn was flattened and there was significant tree damage.  The third and strongest tornado touched down just west of Liberty (Vernon County), then tracked along a continous path just north of Highway 56, to the northern most block of the town of Viola (Richland County).  Three people were reported injured in Viola and almost every tree in the town was damaged or downed.  Most homes in the village had at least minor damage, while a few sustained major damage, including roofs blown off.  Many garages facing west or southwest were destroyed by the direct impact of the winds.  Wind speeds associated with the tornado were estimated at 100 to 120 mph.  The tornado path became more sporadic as it moved east of Viola across northern Richland County.  The damage path extended from just north of County Highway MM and Highway 56 into Bloom City (Richland County), which apparently took a direct hit from the storm.  The tornado continued on an east-southeast track, before lifting just west of Hub City (Richland County).  A fourth tornado touched down along County Road N, or just east of the location where Interstate 90 and 94 split in eastern Monroe County.  This tornado continued on a 10 mile track into Juneau County, ending just west of the Necedah Wildlife Refuge Headquarters.  There was tree, agricultural and structural damage.  A home, which was under construction, was completely destroyed.  Three other homes sustained minor damage.  Corn was flattened and there was significant tree damage as well.  A fifth tornado touched down in the town of Muscoda (Grant County) causing minor damage to homes, but knocking down or shearing off numerous trees.  This tornado crossed the Wisconsin River into the small community of Orion (Richland County).  Several mobile homes were damaged, including several reportedly tossed into the air.  Many trees were damaged there as well.  The sixth and final tornado briefly touched down near the intersection of Highway 82 and 13 in Adams County.  Mobile homes were damaged, along with nearby trees.  Richland and Vernon County were declared federal disaster areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Cooler and drier air was to the north of the front, with very warm and unstable air to the south.  Dew point temperatures approached 70 to the south of the boundary during the morning hours of the 8th.  A short wave tracked southeast across the area in a general northwest flow.  The air mass became quite unstable in the vicinity of the boundary with lifted indices around -7 C.  The shear profile was favorable with about 40 kts of shear in the lower layers.  Plenty of deep moisture was available with the system with precipitable water values in the 1.5 to 1.8 inch range.  Hail was somewhat limited with the storms, but not absent with freezing levels in the 12,500 to 13,000 foot range.  CAPE values ahead of the storms were in the 1500 to 2000 J/kg range, with CAPE in the -10 C to -30 C layer of the atmosphere in the 400 J/kg range.  Thunderstorms which began well to the northwest during the previous night tracked southeast into Iowa during the morning of the 8th.  A steady flow of moisture was transported into the area with a feed at 850 mb of about 25 kts.  The storms were fast moving and the area tended to bow out.  Wind damage was wide spread with numerous reports of winds of 60 to 70 MPH.  An intense cluster of storms moved through the central Iowa area with measured wind gusts of 83 MPH reported at both Ames and Ankeny with the gust front passage.  There was one reported tornado with the system in Ames.  The tornado touched down near the power plant o nthe ISU Campus.  Eight people were injured by the tornado.  One was injured seriously enough to be taken to hospital.  Initial damage estimates were around $150,000.  Many of the storms produced hail, however much of the hail was below severe limits. Reports of penny size hail were received from several locations.   The largest hail came with the cluster in central Iowa.  Golf ball size hail fell west of Elkhart in Polk County.  The storm and high winds resulted in power outages to 8700 customers in the Des Moines area.  The high winds caused a semi-tractortrailer and a camper to oberturn on INterstate 80 just west of exit 141 in Polk County.  The thunderstorms also produced locally heavy rainfall.

A strong upper level system moved through the area with mid and upper level winds in the 70 to 90 kt range.  Low level winds of 35 to 50 kts transported moisture north into the system.  High temperatures reached the mid 60s to low 70s, with dew point readings approaching 60 by late afternoon.  A surface low developed over northern Kansas during the previous night and lifted northeast into eastern South Dakota during the afternoon of the 12th, then into central Minnesota as a 985 mb low by late evening.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with CAPE values reaching 1000 J/kg by late afternoon.  The Lifted Index values were in the -5 C. range.  Being as it was in November, the freezing level was quite low during the event, in the 10,000 to 11,000 foot range.  Though the soundings were quite unidirectional, there was plenty of shear with zero to 6 km shear values around 65 kts. Thunderstorms erupted during the afternoon in west central in to southwest Iowa.  The storms became severe quite quickly.  Initially the storms produce quarter to golf ball size hail, with 2 1/2 inch diameter hail falling in Dallas County.  Hail up to baseball size fell in Greene County as well.  The system transitioned into a tornadic system within an hour with several tornadoes touching down in the central sections of the state.  At least 9 communities were hit by tornadoes and 65 homes damaged or destroyed.  An 82 year old woman was killed in Stratford when the tornado demolished her home.  In a 2 or 3 block area of downtown Woodward, at least 12 houses were totally destroyed.  There was one minor injury in Ames,  two serious injuries in the Woodward area, and three injuries in Stratford.  Due to the extensive damage to property caused by the tornadoes, Iowa Governor Vilsack declared Boone, Story, Webster, Dallas and Hamilton Counties disaster areas.A long-lived tornado tracked through several counties across central Iowa during the late afternoon hours of Nov. 12, 2005.  The tornado path is estimated at 27.5 miles long and between 100 and 150 yards wide along the damage path.Tornado (1) initially touched down just west of E Avenue (just south of Boxholm in northwest Boone county), one half mile south of Boone County Highway E18 at approximately 4:27 p.m as an F1 tornado.  The tornado then tracked northeast across E Avenue, hitting a farm just north of E18, damaging the home and some out buildings.  It also flipped over one pickup truck and killed two horses at this location.The tornado continued northeast, spreading debris across F Avenue just north of 125th Street as it maintained F1 intensity.  Two additional homes were damaged with outbuildings destroyed as the tornado tracked northeast across G and H Avenues near 105th Avenue.  It then intensified to an F2 tornado as it crossed the Boone/Webster county line.  Another home was heavily damaged and a large outbuilding destroyed just north of the Boone/Webster county line.  The tornado quickly moved northeast, crossing 390th Street and headed toward the Des Moines River, weakening to an F1 tornado.A continuous, but weak damage path was observed crossing the river as the tornado tracked across open farmland and land adjacent the Des Moines River.  The tornado has been rated an F1 tornado during this time.  After crossing County D64 in Webster county, the tornado struck another farm near 370th Street and Washington Avenue, damaging the residence and destroying a machine shed along with most of its contents.  The tornado again intensified to an F2 at this location.The tornado then headed toward Stratford, crossing the Webster and Hamilton county line just west of County Road D54.  The tornado entered Stratford at 4:46 p.m. on the west-central end of town, heavily damaging many homes.  The tornado crossed the city park and then exited the city near the north-central portion of Stratford.  Numerous homes were heavily damaged with one fatality.As the tornado left Stratford, it continued on a northeast track, lifting and dropping to the ground several times as an F0 and F1 tornado.  It damaged three additional farms northeast of Stratford with the last damaged farm north of 320th Street and west of County Road R21 in Hamilton County.Tornado (2) touched down one mile west of Minburn in Dallas County  according to the aerial survey.  The tornado tracked northeast for about eight miles, producing F0-F1 damage before intensifying near Highway 141.  The tornado produced F2 damage at a farm one mile southwest of Woodward, and continued to produce F2 damage through the south and east portions of Woodward.  The tornado dissipated one mile northeast of Woodward.  Severe houses slid off their foundations in Woodward, and a double-wide home was flipped upside down into the street.  Total path length was 11 miles.Tornado (3) touched down in open fields one mile northwest of Madrid.  It hit a home three miles north of Madrid on Highway 17, producing F1 damage.  One other farm site sustained damage as the tornado moved northeast.  The tornado dissipated after a six mile track.Tornado (4) started just west of Ames near the Highway 30 and Lincoln Way Split, according to the aerial survey.  The tornado produced F1-F2 damage on the northwest fringe of Ames.  It weakened as it moved northeast, before intensifying again and produced F2 damage to a farm site just south of Gilbert.  F1 damage occurred as the tornado crossed highway 69.  The tornado dissipated three miles south of Story City after a 10 mile track.Tornado (5) was a short-lived satellite tornado that was on the ground for 1.6 miles ending at the southwest edge of Story City.  The aerial survey showed very minor damage.Tornado (6) developed one mile west of Roland and tracked across the extreme southeast corner of Hamilton county before entering Hardin county.  The tornado produced damage up to F1 intensity to rural farm sites in far northern Story county and five miles south of Radcliffe in Hardin county.  The KCCI-TV aerial survey indicated the track was nine miles in length.Tornado (7) was a brief touchdown just south of Williams in Hamilton County.  No damage was found from this brief tornado and it is not shown here.Tornado (8) was briefly sighted near Blakesburg in Monroe County.  The tornado produced minor damage to a farm building but was not surveyed.Tornado (9) touched down briefly north of Steamboat Rock in Hardin County.  The tornado caused little damage.Tornado (10) was actually the first tornado of the day.  It formed from the same supercell that eventually moved northeast into the Stratford area.  The tornado caused little damage as it moved through fields south of the Scranton Area.Tornado (11) was a brief touchdown on the southwest edge of the Ames City limits.  This tornado was from the same parent cell as the previous tornado that touched down in Ames, but was distinct.  The tornado was weak and lifted lawn chairs and caused some shingle damage.  This tornado was ANTICYCLONIC in nature.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Tornado moved from Boone County into Story County.

High temperatures reached the mid 60s to low 70s, with dew point readings approaching 60 by late afternoon.  A surface low developed over northern Kansas during the previous night and lifted northeast into eastern South Dakota during the afternoon of the 12th, then into central Minnesota as a 985 mb low by late evening.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with CAPE values reaching 1000 J/kg by late afternoon.  The Lifted Index values were in the -5 C. range.  Being as it was in November, the freezing level was quite low during the event, in the 10,000 to 11,000 foot range.  Though the soundings were quite unidirectional, there was plenty of shear with zero to 6 km shear values around 65 kts. Thunderstorms erupted during the afternoon in west central in to southwest Iowa.  The storms became severe quite quickly.  Initially the storms produce quarter to golf ball size hail, with 2 1/2 inch diameter hail falling in Dallas County.  Hail up to baseball size fell in Greene County as well.  The system transitioned into a tornadic system within an hour with several tornadoes touching down in the central sections of the state.  At least 9 communities were hit by tornadoes and 65 homes damaged or destroyed.  An 82 year old woman was killed in Stratford when the tornado demolished her home.  In a 2 or 3 block area of downtown Woodward, at least 12 houses were totally destroyed.  There was one minor injury in Ames,  two serious injuries in the Woodward area, and three injuries in Stratford.  Due to the extensive damage to property caused by the tornadoes, Iowa Governor Vilsack declared Boone, Story, Webster, Dallas and Hamilton Counties disaster areas.A long-lived tornado tracked through several counties across central Iowa during the late afternoon hours of Nov. 12, 2005.  The tornado path is estimated at 27.5 miles long and between 100 and 150 yards wide along the damage path.Tornado (1) initially touched down just west of E Avenue (just south of Boxholm in northwest Boone county), one half mile south of Boone County Highway E18 at approximately 4:27 p.m as an F1 tornado.  The tornado then tracked northeast across E Avenue, hitting a farm just north of E18, damaging the home and some out buildings.  It also flipped over one pickup truck and killed two horses at this location.The tornado continued northeast, spreading debris across F Avenue just north of 125th Street as it maintained F1 intensity.  Two additional homes were damaged with outbuildings destroyed as the tornado tracked northeast across G and H Avenues near 105th Avenue.  It then intensified to an F2 tornado as it crossed the Boone/Webster county line.  Another home was heavily damaged and a large outbuilding destroyed just north of the Boone/Webster county line.  The tornado quickly moved northeast, crossing 390th Street and headed toward the Des Moines River, weakening to an F1 tornado.A continuous, but weak damage path was observed crossing the river as the tornado tracked across open farmland and land adjacent the Des Moines River.  The tornado has been rated an F1 tornado during this time.  After crossing County D64 in Webster county, the tornado struck another farm near 370th Street and Washington Avenue, damaging the residence and destroying a machine shed along with most of its contents.  The tornado again intensified to an F2 at this location.The tornado then headed toward Stratford, crossing the Webster and Hamilton county line just west of County Road D54.  The tornado entered Stratford at 4:46 p.m. on the west-central end of town, heavily damaging many homes.  The tornado crossed the city park and then exited the city near the north-central portion of Stratford.  Numerous homes were heavily damaged with one fatality.As the tornado left Stratford, it continued on a northeast track, lifting and dropping to the ground several times as an F0 and F1 tornado.  It damaged three additional farms northeast of Stratford with the last damaged farm north of 320th Street and west of County Road R21 in Hamilton County.Tornado (2) touched down one mile west of Minburn in Dallas County  according to the aerial survey.  The tornado tracked northeast for about eight miles, producing F0-F1 damage before intensifying near Highway 141.  The tornado produced F2 damage at a farm one mile southwest of Woodward, and continued to produce F2 damage through the south and east portions of Woodward.  The tornado dissipated one mile northeast of Woodward.  Severe houses slid off their foundations in Woodward, and a double-wide home was flipped upside down into the street.  Total path length was 11 miles.Tornado (3) touched down in open fields one mile northwest of Madrid.  It hit a home three miles north of Madrid on Highway 17, producing F1 damage.  One other farm site sustained damage as the tornado moved northeast.  The tornado dissipated after a six mile track.Tornado (4) started just west of Ames near the Highway 30 and Lincoln Way Split, according to the aerial survey.  The tornado produced F1-F2 damage on the northwest fringe of Ames.  It weakened as it moved northeast, before intensifying again and produced F2 damage to a farm site just south of Gilbert.  F1 damage occurred as the tornado crossed highway 69.  The tornado dissipated three miles south of Story City after a 10 mile track.Tornado (5) was a short-lived satellite tornado that was on the ground for 1.6 miles ending at the southwest edge of Story City.  The aerial survey showed very minor damage.Tornado (6) developed one mile west of Roland and tracked across the extreme southeast corner of Hamilton county before entering Hardin county.  The tornado produced damage up to F1 intensity to rural farm sites in far northern Story county and five miles south of Radcliffe in Hardin county.  The KCCI-TV aerial survey indicated the track was nine miles in length.Tornado (7) was a brief touchdown just south of Williams in Hamilton County.  No damage was found from this brief tornado and it is not shown here.Tornado (8) was briefly sighted near Blakesburg in Monroe County.  The tornado produced minor damage to a farm building but was not surveyed.Tornado (9) touched down briefly north of Steamboat Rock in Hardin County.  The tornado caused little damage.Tornado (10) was actually the first tornado of the day.  It formed from the same supercell that eventually moved northeast into the Stratford area.  The tornado caused little damage as it moved through fields south of the Scranton Area.Tornado (11) was a brief touchdown on the southwest edge of the Ames City limits.  This tornado was from the same parent cell as the previous tornado that touched down in Ames, but was distinct.  The tornado was weak and lifted lawn chairs and caused some shingle damage.  This tornado was ANTICYCLONIC in nature.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Tornado moved from Boone County into Story County.

It was in the area of Tatum Rd through Rushwood Rd that two fatalities occurred, both of them elderly residents.  The majority of the injuries also occurred in this area.  After leaving the Rushwood Rd area, the storm began to weaken and decreasing in path width.  Except for minor structural damage to buildings in Lawson, trees downed or broken was the main damage for the latter part of the track.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong upper level system moved through the area with mid and upper level winds in the 70 to 90 kt range.  Low level winds of 35 to 50 kts transported moisture north into the system.  High temperatures reached the mid 60s to low 70s, with dew point readings approaching 60 by late afternoon.  A surface low developed over northern Kansas during the previous night and lifted northeast into eastern South Dakota during the afternoon of the 12th, then into central Minnesota as a 985 mb low by late evening.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with CAPE values reaching 1000 J/kg by late afternoon.  The Lifted Index values were in the -5 C. range.  Being as it was in November, the freezing level was quite low during the event, in the 10,000 to 11,000 foot range.  Though the soundings were quite unidirectional, there was plenty of shear with zero to 6 km shear values around 65 kts. Thunderstorms erupted during the afternoon in west central in to southwest Iowa.  The storms became severe quite quickly.  Initially the storms produce quarter to golf ball size hail, with 2 1/2 inch diameter hail falling in Dallas County.  Hail up to baseball size fell in Greene County as well.  The system transitioned into a tornadic system within an hour with several tornadoes touching down in the central sections of the state.  At least 9 communities were hit by tornadoes and 65 homes damaged or destroyed.  An 82 year old woman was killed in Stratford when the tornado demolished her home.  In a 2 or 3 block area of downtown Woodward, at least 12 houses were totally destroyed.  There was one minor injury in Ames,  two serious injuries in the Woodward area, and three injuries in Stratford.  Due to the extensive damage to property caused by the tornadoes, Iowa Governor Vilsack declared Boone, Story, Webster, Dallas and Hamilton Counties disaster areas.A long-lived tornado tracked through several counties across central Iowa during the late afternoon hours of Nov. 12, 2005.  The tornado path is estimated at 27.5 miles long and between 100 and 150 yards wide along the damage path.Tornado (1) initially touched down just west of E Avenue (just south of Boxholm in northwest Boone county), one half mile south of Boone County Highway E18 at approximately 4:27 p.m as an F1 tornado.  The tornado then tracked northeast across E Avenue, hitting a farm just north of E18, damaging the home and some out buildings.  It also flipped over one pickup truck and killed two horses at this location.The tornado continued northeast, spreading debris across F Avenue just north of 125th Street as it maintained F1 intensity.  Two additional homes were damaged with outbuildings destroyed as the tornado tracked northeast across G and H Avenues near 105th Avenue.  It then intensified to an F2 tornado as it crossed the Boone/Webster county line.  Another home was heavily damaged and a large outbuilding destroyed just north of the Boone/Webster county line.  The tornado quickly moved northeast, crossing 390th Street and headed toward the Des Moines River, weakening to an F1 tornado.A continuous, but weak damage path was observed crossing the river as the tornado tracked across open farmland and land adjacent the Des Moines River.  The tornado has been rated an F1 tornado during this time.  After crossing County D64 in Webster county, the tornado struck another farm near 370th Street and Washington Avenue, damaging the residence and destroying a machine shed along with most of its contents.  The tornado again intensified to an F2 at this location.The tornado then headed toward Stratford, crossing the Webster and Hamilton county line just west of County Road D54.  The tornado entered Stratford at 4:46 p.m. on the west-central end of town, heavily damaging many homes.  The tornado crossed the city park and then exited the city near the north-central portion of Stratford.  Numerous homes were heavily damaged with one fatality.As the tornado left Stratford, it continued on a northeast track, lifting and dropping to the ground several times as an F0 and F1 tornado.  It damaged three additional farms northeast of Stratford with the last damaged farm north of 320th Street and west of County Road R21 in Hamilton County.Tornado (2) touched down one mile west of Minburn in Dallas County  according to the aerial survey.  The tornado tracked northeast for about eight miles, producing F0-F1 damage before intensifying near Highway 141.  The tornado produced F2 damage at a farm one mile southwest of Woodward, and continued to produce F2 damage through the south and east portions of Woodward.  The tornado dissipated one mile northeast of Woodward.  Severe houses slid off their foundations in Woodward, and a double-wide home was flipped upside down into the street.  Total path length was 11 miles.Tornado (3) touched down in open fields one mile northwest of Madrid.  It hit a home three miles north of Madrid on Highway 17, producing F1 damage.  One other farm site sustained damage as the tornado moved northeast.  The tornado dissipated after a six mile track.Tornado (4) started just west of Ames near the Highway 30 and Lincoln Way Split, according to the aerial survey.  The tornado produced F1-F2 damage on the northwest fringe of Ames.  It weakened as it moved northeast, before intensifying again and produced F2 damage to a farm site just south of Gilbert.  F1 damage occurred as the tornado crossed highway 69.  The tornado dissipated three miles south of Story City after a 10 mile track.Tornado (5) was a short-lived satellite tornado that was on the ground for 1.6 miles ending at the southwest edge of Story City.  The aerial survey showed very minor damage.Tornado (6) developed one mile west of Roland and tracked across the extreme southeast corner of Hamilton county before entering Hardin county.  The tornado produced damage up to F1 intensity to rural farm sites in far northern Story county and five miles south of Radcliffe in Hardin county.  The KCCI-TV aerial survey indicated the track was nine miles in length.Tornado (7) was a brief touchdown just south of Williams in Hamilton County.  No damage was found from this brief tornado and it is not shown here.Tornado (8) was briefly sighted near Blakesburg in Monroe County.  The tornado produced minor damage to a farm building but was not surveyed.Tornado (9) touched down briefly north of Steamboat Rock in Hardin County.  The tornado caused little damage.Tornado (10) was actually the first tornado of the day.  It formed from the same supercell that eventually moved northeast into the Stratford area.  The tornado caused little damage as it moved through fields south of the Scranton Area.Tornado (11) was a brief touchdown on the southwest edge of the Ames City limits.  This tornado was from the same parent cell as the previous tornado that touched down in Ames, but was distinct.  The tornado was weak and lifted lawn chairs and caused some shingle damage.

A strong upper level system moved through the area with mid and upper level winds in the 70 to 90 kt range.  Low level winds of 35 to 50 kts transported moisture north into the system.  High temperatures reached the mid 60s to low 70s, with dew point readings approaching 60 by late afternoon.  A surface low developed over northern Kansas during the previous night and lifted northeast into eastern South Dakota during the afternoon of the 12th, then into central Minnesota as a 985 mb low by late evening.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with CAPE values reaching 1000 J/kg by late afternoon.  The Lifted Index values were in the -5 C. range.  Being as it was in November, the freezing level was quite low during the event, in the 10,000 to 11,000 foot range.  Though the soundings were quite unidirectional, there was plenty of shear with zero to 6 km shear values around 65 kts. Thunderstorms erupted during the afternoon in west central in to southwest Iowa.  The storms became severe quite quickly.  Initially the storms produce quarter to golf ball size hail, with 2 1/2 inch diameter hail falling in Dallas County.  Hail up to baseball size fell in Greene County as well.  The system transitioned into a tornadic system within an hour with several tornadoes touching down in the central sections of the state.  At least 9 communities were hit by tornadoes and 65 homes damaged or destroyed.  An 82 year old woman was killed in Stratford when the tornado demolished her home.  In a 2 or 3 block area of downtown Woodward, at least 12 houses were totally destroyed.  There was one minor injury in Ames,  two serious injuries in the Woodward area, and three injuries in Stratford.  Due to the extensive damage to property caused by the tornadoes, Iowa Governor Vilsack declared Boone, Story, Webster, Dallas and Hamilton Counties disaster areas.A long-lived tornado tracked through several counties across central Iowa during the late afternoon hours of Nov. 12, 2005.  The tornado path is estimated at 27.5 miles long and between 100 and 150 yards wide along the damage path.Tornado (1) initially touched down just west of E Avenue (just south of Boxholm in northwest Boone county), one half mile south of Boone County Highway E18 at approximately 4:27 p.m as an F1 tornado.  The tornado then tracked northeast across E Avenue, hitting a farm just north of E18, damaging the home and some out buildings.  It also flipped over one pickup truck and killed two horses at this location.The tornado continued northeast, spreading debris across F Avenue just north of 125th Street as it maintained F1 intensity.  Two additional homes were damaged with outbuildings destroyed as the tornado tracked northeast across G and H Avenues near 105th Avenue.  It then intensified to an F2 tornado as it crossed the Boone/Webster county line.  Another home was heavily damaged and a large outbuilding destroyed just north of the Boone/Webster county line.  The tornado quickly moved northeast, crossing 390th Street and headed toward the Des Moines River, weakening to an F1 tornado.A continuous, but weak damage path was observed crossing the river as the tornado tracked across open farmland and land adjacent the Des Moines River.  The tornado has been rated an F1 tornado during this time.  After crossing County D64 in Webster county, the tornado struck another farm near 370th Street and Washington Avenue, damaging the residence and destroying a machine shed along with most of its contents.  The tornado again intensified to an F2 at this location.The tornado then headed toward Stratford, crossing the Webster and Hamilton county line just west of County Road D54.  The tornado entered Stratford at 4:46 p.m. on the west-central end of town, heavily damaging many homes.  The tornado crossed the city park and then exited the city near the north-central portion of Stratford.  Numerous homes were heavily damaged with one fatality.As the tornado left Stratford, it continued on a northeast track, lifting and dropping to the ground several times as an F0 and F1 tornado.  It damaged three additional farms northeast of Stratford with the last damaged farm north of 320th Street and west of County Road R21 in Hamilton County.Tornado (2) touched down one mile west of Minburn in Dallas County  according to the aerial survey.  The tornado tracked northeast for about eight miles, producing F0-F1 damage before intensifying near Highway 141.  The tornado produced F2 damage at a farm one mile southwest of Woodward, and continued to produce F2 damage through the south and east portions of Woodward.  The tornado dissipated one mile northeast of Woodward.  Severe houses slid off their foundations in Woodward, and a double-wide home was flipped upside down into the street.  Total path length was 11 miles.Tornado (3) touched down in open fields one mile northwest of Madrid.  It hit a home three miles north of Madrid on Highway 17, producing F1 damage.  One other farm site sustained damage as the tornado moved northeast.  The tornado dissipated after a six mile track.Tornado (4) started just west of Ames near the Highway 30 and Lincoln Way Split, according to the aerial survey.  The tornado produced F1-F2 damage on the northwest fringe of Ames.  It weakened as it moved northeast, before intensifying again and produced F2 damage to a farm site just south of Gilbert.  F1 damage occurred as the tornado crossed highway 69.  The tornado dissipated three miles south of Story City after a 10 mile track.Tornado (5) was a short-lived satellite tornado that was on the ground for 1.6 miles ending at the southwest edge of Story City.  The aerial survey showed very minor damage.Tornado (6) developed one mile west of Roland and tracked across the extreme southeast corner of Hamilton county before entering Hardin county.  The tornado produced damage up to F1 intensity to rural farm sites in far northern Story county and five miles south of Radcliffe in Hardin county.  The KCCI-TV aerial survey indicated the track was nine miles in length.Tornado (7) was a brief touchdown just south of Williams in Hamilton County.  No damage was found from this brief tornado and it is not shown here.Tornado (8) was briefly sighted near Blakesburg in Monroe County.  The tornado produced minor damage to a farm building but was not surveyed.Tornado (9) touched down briefly north of Steamboat Rock in Hardin County.

This second crossing was from Vanderburgh County, Indiana into Henderson County. The tornado then crossed the river a third time less than a mile west of the U.S. Highway 41 twin bridges. The river does not form the state line at the third crossing. From the bridges, extensive tree damage was visible along both sides of the Ohio River. Almost immediately after crossing the river, the tornado slammed into a horse racing facility named Ellis Park. There was extensive damage to grandstands and housing facilities for jockeys. A few race horses were killed. This facility was the first major facility to be impacted by the tornado. All of the Henderson County tornado injuries were at Ellis Park. The tornado then crossed back into Vanderburgh County, Indiana after striking Ellis Park.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado was on the ground for 3 miles in Concordia parish before it moved into Tensas parish. The damage in Clayton and just to the northeast was confined to a few trees uprooted and snapped with one tree landing on a mobile home causing 1 injury. The tornado became more intense as it moved across southern Tensas parish. The tornado tracked nearly 6 miles across swamp land before it slammed into a small church on Highway 566. The church was totally destroyed as it was blown off its pillars and deposited in a tree and across the Highway. After traveling across more fields for 2 miles the tornado hit the "Thunderbird House". Here the tornado was at its peak intensity and caused the most significant damage. All the trees on the property were uprooted and mangled, a john boat was wrapped in a tree like tin foil and the large barn in the back yard was totally destroyed. The large house had its second story torn off and deposited 1/4 to 1/2 a mile down the path. This house was around 100 years old, between 5000-6000 sq ft and firmly built. The tornado picked the house up and moved it 4 feet and tore off 2 of the side walls. Additionally, both vehicles in the driveway were moved some 10-15 feet and heavily damaged by debris. The tornado continued to the northeast were it destroyed another home blowing off the roof and all the exterior walls. At this location, a car was picked up and flipped over onto a pile of downed trees. A house on the edge of the path had widows blown out and part of the roof blown off.This tornado had a total path length of 14 miles across Concordia and Tensas parishes. Overall the tornado was not very wide but it was very intense. Fortunately, the tornado moved across a sparsely populated and rural area keeping significant damage to a minimum.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the tornado moved quickly northeast across Marshall County, it reached its peak intensity of 200 MPH as it approached the Kentucky Lake resort campgrounds and boatyards. Until the tornado reached U.S. Highway 641 south of Benton, mostly F-1 damage occurred. Garages and barns sustained varying degrees of damage, and numerous trees were down. The most serious damage, ranging up to F-3 intensity, occurred from Big Bear Highway to Moor's Resort on Kentucky Lake. The occupant of a destroyed mobile home was killed in this area. The mobile home was thrown 40 feet and overturned before catching fire. At Moor's Resort, a year-round camping area was struck directly. A total of 115 RV's were destroyed, and the campground was devastated. A dock was demolished, taking a number of boats with it. Although the harbor and campground were destroyed, cabins and other lodging facilities outside of the tornado path were untouched. The average path width of this tornado was 275 yards, but it grew to a maximum of 500 yards in Marshall County.

As the tornado moved quickly northeast across Marshall County, it reached its peak intensity of 200 MPH as it approached the Kentucky Lake resort campgrounds and boatyards. Until the tornado reached U.S. Highway 641 south of Benton, mostly F-1 damage occurred. Garages and barns sustained varying degrees of damage, and numerous trees were down. The most serious damage, ranging up to F-3 intensity, occurred from Big Bear Highway to Moor's Resort on Kentucky Lake. The occupant of a destroyed mobile home was killed in this area. The mobile home was thrown 40 feet and overturned before catching fire. At Moor's Resort, a year-round camping area was struck directly. A total of 115 RV's were destroyed, and the campground was devastated. A dock was demolished, taking a number of boats with it. Although the harbor and campground were destroyed, cabins and other lodging facilities outside of the tornado path were untouched. The average path width of this tornado was 275 yards, but it grew to a maximum of 500 yards in Marshall County. In Marshall County, approximately 19 homes were destroyed, 36 suffered major damage, and 65 received minor damage. The tornado then moved over Kentucky Lake and crossed into Lyon County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One strongly rotating supercell produced three tornadoes, two of them rated strong F3, over southern portions of central Indiana.

A resident sustained an ankle injury when moving quickly down into his basement with his family to take cover.

Genevieve County near Highway NN and just west of the community of Giboney. The tornado moved northeast, crossing Interstate 55 only about one-half mile from the Ste. Genevieve County line. Two fatalities and F3 damage occurred in the vicinity of where the tornado crossed U.S. Route 61. The two fatalities occurred on U.S. 61, where a vehicle was picked up and thrown into a propane tank. The truck in which they were riding was likely picked up, flipped over, and slammed into the ground several times. The coroner stated that the victims died instantly. One of the victims was ejected from the truck, which then struck the top of a large propane tank. Because of the ensuing propane leak, the victim still in the truck could not be removed until the following day, when the propane was off-loaded from the tank. Both of the victims in the vehicle were residents of a mobile home who were trying to flee the tornado. The home from which they fled sustained only minor damage. At least four other people were significantly injured as they were picked up by tornadic winds and hurled 100 yards. Their injuries were compounded by wind-blown debris. Eight victims were admitted to a local hospital to remove debris which penetrated their bodies, and two others were sent to regional hospitals for serious injuries. Three mobile homes were flattened, a brick house had its roof and several walls blown off, and numerous vehicles were tossed around. A total of about a dozen residences were destroyed or severely damaged in Perry County. Perry County was designated a federal disaster area, enabling individual residents to apply for relief. The dashboard camera in a sheriff deputy's patrol car captured the tornado on film as it crossed U.S. 61 at F3 intensity. Peak winds were estimated near 170 MPH.  The tornado crossed into Randolph County, Illinois at Old River, near some railroad tracks about 1.5 miles southeast of St. Marys.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Genevieve County near Highway NN and just west of the community of Giboney. The tornado moved northeast, crossing Interstate 55 only about one-half mile from the Ste. Genevieve County line. Two fatalities and F3 damage occurred in the vicinity of where the tornado crossed U.S. Route 61. The two fatalities occurred on U.S. 61, where a vehicle was picked up and thrown into a propane tank. The truck in which they were riding was likely picked up, flipped over, and slammed into the ground several times. The coroner stated that the victims died instantly. One of the victims was ejected from the truck, which then struck the top of a large propane tank. Because of the ensuing propane leak, the victim still in the truck could not be removed until the following day, when the propane was off-loaded from the tank.

Damage was first found on Highway Y where a home suffered roof damage. On West Boonslick Road a porta potty business suffered roof damage in addition to having about 20 porta potties destroyed, a few of which were missing. A garbage bin was blown about 100 yards into a field and a mobile home just north of the business was blown onto its side and destroyed. Damage in this area was rated F1 and was 100 yards wide. The tornado crossed Interstate 70 at mile marker 83 where it pushed a tractor-trailer off the highway. The tornado then produced damage as it crossed Highway E. Several homes suffered roof damage and several garage and barn type structures were destroyed. The tornado continued northeast and caused extensive damage as it crossed Oak Hall Road (County Road 250). The CC Pallet Company was destroyed and two mobile homes were destroyed. A 73 year old woman suffered broken bones and a back injury in one of the mobile homes. The tornado at this location was 200 yards wide and was rated F2. The tornado moved northeast causing tree damage as it moved across primarily open fields. Just north of Highway NN a new home was destroyed, tress were mangled and another home suffered roof damage.

The Perry County segment of the tornado was rated at its maximum intensity and width shortly after crossing the county line. Shortly after crossing into Perry County, some coal trucks were blown over, and a modular home was totally destroyed on Route 154 near Route 150. Two persons in the home were trapped inside for a time, but they sustained only minor injuries that were treated at a local hospital.

Several eyewitnesses at this location reported two funnels. As the tornado continued its northeast movement, passing northwest of Pinckneyville, it weakened to F1 intensity. Near where it crossed Illinois Route 13, trees were uprooted, roofs were blown off, and power poles were snapped. Siding was blown off a house. Near the end of the tornado track, just northwest of Tamaroa, a metal building was destroyed. Debris from the building was blown about 400 yards. A nearby house lost all of its shingles. Along the 20-mile path through Perry County, dozens of barns and outbuildings were severely damaged or destroyed. Dozens of homes sustained varying degrees of damage, ranging from minor to major. Hundreds of trees were uprooted or snapped.  Peak winds on this county segment were estimated at 140 MPH, mainly near the Randolph County line. The average path width was close to 200 yards. A deputy sheriff reported a tornado crossing U.S. Highway 51 north of Tamaroa.

These storms evolved into splitting supercells, and resulted in large hail up to two inches in diameter in Dickens and Motley Counties. The anticyclonic member from one of the mentioned storms propagated northward over Childress County during the early evening hours. The storm effectively lowered temperature-to-dewpoint depressions and locally backed the near-surface winds. A classic supercell subsequently propagated southeastward out of the Texas Panhandle and over Hall County. This storm interacted with the "outflow boundary" left by the departing anticyclonic storm. The southeastward propagating storm rapidly became tornadic near the northwestern corner of Childress. Large hail, damaging RFD winds, and the significant (F2) tornado resulted in nearly $6 million in damages and injured one. A school net weather instrument located at the heavily damaged Childress High School measured a peak wind gust of 109 MPH as the tornado destroyed the school's gymnasium.A second round of isolated severe storms produced large hail over the extreme southeastern Texas Panhandle as clean-up crews worked in the damaged areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado resulted in significant (F2) damage along a one and half mile path through the north side of Childress during the evening hours of the 9th. The tornado developed in a residential are of northwest Childress at 20:30 CST. Damage in the neighborhood was characterized as weak, with numerous downed trees, street signs, and damaged roofs. A resident was injured when a tree fell and struck him, breaking his arm and causing minor lacerations.The tornado then moved east toward the high school. Damage to the high school was extensive. A local television network, KVII-TV in Amarillo, operates an automated weather station on the campus as part of a regional school net.

These storms evolved into splitting supercells, and resulted in large hail up to two inches in diameter in Dickens and Motley Counties. The anticyclonic member from one of the mentioned storms propagated northward over Childress County during the early evening hours. The storm effectively lowered temperature-to-dewpoint depressions and locally backed the near-surface winds. A classic supercell subsequently propagated southeastward out of the Texas Panhandle and over Hall County. This storm interacted with the "outflow boundary" left by the departing anticyclonic storm. The southeastward propagating storm rapidly became tornadic near the northwestern corner of Childress. Large hail, damaging RFD winds, and the significant (F2) tornado resulted in nearly $6 million in damages and injured one. A school net weather instrument located at the heavily damaged Childress High School measured a peak wind gust of 109 MPH as the tornado destroyed the school's gymnasium.A second round of isolated severe storms produced large hail over the extreme southeastern Texas Panhandle as clean-up crews worked in the damaged areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado resulted in significant (F2) damage along a one and half mile path through the north side of Childress during the evening hours of the 9th. The tornado developed in a residential are of northwest Childress at 20:30 CST. Damage in the neighborhood was characterized as weak, with numerous downed trees, street signs, and damaged roofs. A resident was injured when a tree fell and struck him, breaking his arm and causing minor lacerations.The tornado then moved east toward the high school. Damage to the high school was extensive. A local television network, KVII-TV in Amarillo, operates an automated weather station on the campus as part of a regional school net. The instrument measured a 109 MPH wind gust as the tornado ripped through the facility at 20:32 CST. Damage at Childress High School was rated F1, with large brick walls blown inn and portions of the building's roof removed.

This path took it through the southeast corner of the University of Iowa campus.  This was the first tornado to hit near the campus in 35 years and the University was closed on Friday April 14th for safety reasons.The KIOW ASOS at the airport on the southwest side of the city recorded a peak wind gust of 49 knots (57 mph) at 1931 CST.  This gust was likely the result of the rear flank downdraft as the tornado neared the intersection of U.S. 6 and highway 1 northeast of the airport.  Hard times for the location of the tornado are 1930 CST at the Wal-Mart.  At 1932-1933 CST power was lost at the Johnson County Sheriff Office with telephone lines, LAN, and automated systems going down as the tornado passed over the building.  While the tornado was passing over the sheriff's office, someone flipped the outdoor warning sirens from automatic to manual override and activated the sirens one final time.Damage totals are still being evaluated and the $12 million amount will likely be closer to $15 million or possibly higher.  Known damage amounts include; Iowa City and Johnson County $4 million with an additional $755,000 of uninsured loses (traffic lights, signs, street lights), University of Iowa $6 million with the motor pool headquarters a total loss and 31 vehicles damaged, and $1.3 million in damage to residences/businesses.  Three automobile dealerships were damaged; one dealership had 200 vehicles damaged, a second had 60-70 vehicles damaged, and a third had nearly every vehicle sustaining some type of damage.A total of 1,016 residential and 35 commercial buildings were damaged with some destroyed.  Some well known landmark buildings known to citizens, college students, and alumni were lost or heavily damaged.  These included the Dairy Queen (lost) and St. Patrick's Church (heavily damaged).  Several historic buildings were damaged downtown and it is unknown whether or not they can or will be saved.  The tornado damaged the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house and damaged many student apartments located just off the campus on Iowa, Dodge, and Governor streets.Given the strength and width of the tornado it is amazing that only 30 injuries (many minor) occurred.  Many U of I students were unaware of what was happening or dashed to a nearby parking garage for safety with the tornado approaching a few blocks behind them.  Several foreign exchange students, many of whom had never seen, experienced, or heard of a tornado, were in awe and disbelief over the magnitude of the event.  At St. Patrick's Church, the Maundy Thursday evening service had just ended.  Upon being told of an approaching tornado by Decon Jerome Miller, the Reverend Rudolph Juarez ushered 50 to 75 parishioners (many elderly) to the safety of the rectory basement next door.  This action saved the lives of everyone as the tornado tore off the roof off the church and collapsed the top portion of the brick facade and the steeple into the main congregation area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Rated very high F2 with winds estimated at 155 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 12M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several large trees and large limbs were downed by the tornado. The damage width at this location was 60 yards wide while damage intensity was rated F0. The tornado traveled northeast through a small subdivision southwest of Lincoln Trail (US 50) and Cathy Lane. There was minor roof damage to several homes, a two car garage was damaged and several large trees were either uprooted or snapped half way up. On the east side of Cathy Lane the roof of an apartment building was damaged while a second establishment sustained side and roof damage. Damage was rated F1 intensity while the damage width ranged from 60 to 80 yards. On the north side of US 50 several large power poles were snapped off. Other establishments along the north side of US 50 sustained various degrees of damage. Light poles and tree damage revealed a convergent damage pattern indicative of a tornado. The tornado then hit the south side of the K & G clothing store. The front center part of the roof collapsed while debris from this area was pushed along the east side of the large store. There was one fatality and 11 injuries at this store. The damage width ranged between 80 to 100 yards in this area while the damage intensity was rated lower end of F2. The tornado continued northeast across St. Clair Square Mall, Interstate 64, and then hit a church on Old Collinsville Road. The tornado damaged the steeple and roof of the church. The tornado then damaged three homes and one farm just west of the intersection of Milburn School Road and Pausch Road 2 miles northeast of Fairview Heights. Several large trees were also damaged over this area. The damage width was approximately 60 yards wide while damage Intensity was rated F1. The tornado then crossed the intersection of Kyle and Simmons Road and caused only minor roof damage to six homes in a subdivision north of Kyle Road. The tornado continued to travel northeast and caused damage to several homes in the Crown Point subdivision just south of O\`Fallon-Troy Road. The roof of one home was completely uplifted and tossed over 100 yards to the northeast. The damage width was 100 yards wide while damage intensity was rated F2. The tornado then crossed O\`Fallon-Troy Road and totally destroyed a machine shed at a farm. Debris from the machine shed was tossed over 1/3 mile to the northeast. Two other homes 1/4 mile north of the intersection of Weil and O\`Fallon road sustained varying degrees of damage. The roof of one home was uplifted and displaced to the northeast. Several trees in this area were also damaged. The width of the tornadic damage was 100 yards while damage intensity was rated F1. Insulation debris from both homes was tossed over 300 yards across an open field and line of large trees. The total tornadic damage track was approximately 7 miles. This tornado was a type referred to as a non-supercell tornado. Given that the line of thunderstorm which produced this tornado was moving 60 mph, the tornado was only on the ground for about 8 minutes.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado then hit the south side of the K & G clothing store. The front center part of the roof collapsed while debris from this area was pushed along the east side of the large store. There was one fatality and 11 injuries at this store. The damage width ranged between 80 to 100 yards in this area while the damage intensity was rated lower end of F2. The tornado continued northeast across St. Clair Square Mall, Interstate 64, and then hit a church on Old Collinsville Road. The tornado damaged the steeple and roof of the church. The tornado then damaged three homes and one farm just west of the intersection of Milburn School Road and Pausch Road 2 miles northeast of Fairview Heights. Several large trees were also damaged over this area. The damage width was approximately 60 yards wide while damage Intensity was rated F1. The tornado then crossed the intersection of Kyle and Simmons Road and caused only minor roof damage to six homes in a subdivision north of Kyle Road. The tornado continued to travel northeast and caused damage to several homes in the Crown Point subdivision just south of O\`Fallon-Troy Road. The roof of one home was completely uplifted and tossed over 100 yards to the northeast. The damage width was 100 yards wide while damage intensity was rated F2. The tornado then crossed O\`Fallon-Troy Road and totally destroyed a machine shed at a farm. Debris from the machine shed was tossed over 1/3 mile to the northeast. Two other homes 1/4 mile north of the intersection of Weil and O\`Fallon road sustained varying degrees of damage. The roof of one home was uplifted and displaced to the northeast. Several trees in this area were also damaged. The width of the tornadic damage was 100 yards while damage intensity was rated F1. Insulation debris from both homes was tossed over 300 yards across an open field and line of large trees. The total tornadic damage track was approximately 7 miles. This tornado was a type referred to as a non-supercell tornado. Given that the line of thunderstorm which produced this tornado was moving 60 mph, the tornado was only on the ground for about 8 minutes.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado began less than two miles from the Trigg County line with an east-southeast movement, then curved slightly left before crossing Highway 91. The tornado moved east-northeast across central Christian County, passing less than four miles north of downtown Hopkinsville, before crossing into Todd County less than a mile north of Pilot Rock. Near the beginning of the damage path, a church was levelled. Across the county, 91 homes were destroyed, and another 171 homes sustained varying degrees of damage. Several people were pulled from the debris of their homes during a door-to-door search that lasted into the next morning. Of the 22 people directly injured by the tornado, 17 were checked in at the local hospital, and five were transferred to regional hospitals. Another ten or so people received injuries not directly inflicted by the tornado, such as driving into fallen trees. None of the injuries, which consisted mostly of cuts, bruises, and fractures, were considered life-threatening. Numerous garages, barns, and outbuildings were destroyed. Some vehicles were damaged or destroyed. Hundreds of trees were downed, snapped, or uprooted. Power was out to most of the city of Hopkinsville for about six hours as a result of downed steel towers that carry primary transmission lines. Peak winds were estimated near 185 MPH. The average path width was 500 yards. It should be noted that the initial tornado reformed or reorganized about 7 miles northeast of Hopkinsville, leaving a break in the tornado path less than a mile long. Downburst wind damage occurred both north and south of the area where the tornado reorganized, resulting in a two-mile wide swath of damage along Highway 107. The webcam at the local hospital captured the tornado as it passed north of downtown Hopkinsville.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 35M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

None of the injuries, which consisted mostly of cuts, bruises, and fractures, were considered life-threatening. Numerous garages, barns, and outbuildings were destroyed. Some vehicles were damaged or destroyed. Hundreds of trees were downed, snapped, or uprooted. Power was out to most of the city of Hopkinsville for about six hours as a result of downed steel towers that carry primary transmission lines. Peak winds were estimated near 185 MPH. The average path width was 500 yards. It should be noted that the initial tornado reformed or reorganized about 7 miles northeast of Hopkinsville, leaving a break in the tornado path less than a mile long. Downburst wind damage occurred both north and south of the area where the tornado reorganized, resulting in a two-mile wide swath of damage along Highway 107. The webcam at the local hospital captured the tornado as it passed north of downtown Hopkinsville.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 35M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Two tornadic damage tracks were uncovered across a lake west of Highway OO along County Roads 271 and 272.  Over 20 homes, mobile homes and machine sheds sustained varying degrees of damage.  Several witnesses observed twin tornadoes merging into one large tornado over this area.  The width of the damage path of the northern track was approximately 150 yards wide while the southern damage path was about 100 yards wide.  The damage intensity ranged from F1 to F2 in this location.  As the large tornado crossed Highway OO, five homes, four mobile homes and several machine sheds sustained varying degrees of damage.  The damage path was 300 yards wide and high end F1 intensity.  The tornado continued east along County Road 217.  Four homes sustained F1 to F2 damage with debris from two of the homes thrown between 50 to 100 yards to the east.  Also, numerous trees were either snapped or uprooted in this area.  The width of the damage path in this area was about 250 yards.  Further east, two tornadic damage tracks were uncovered about half a mile to a mile north of the intersection of County Roads 215 and 217.  Four homes sustained varying degrees of damage while one mobile home was completely destroyed.  One person was critically injured near the destroyed mobile home.  Debris from the mobile home was tossed over 150 yards to the east.  The width of the northern damage path was about 150 yards, while the width of the southern track was about 50 yards.  The damage was rated high end F1 in this location.  Witnesses observed the twin tornadoes merge again into one large funnel as it crossed a second small lake north of County Road 217.  Four homes and several machine sheds sustained damage.  Also, over a thousand trees around the lake were snapped or uprooted.  The damage path was a quarter of a mile wide in this location and was rated F1 to low end F2.  The tornado continued eastward into northeast Madison County crossing County Road 219 just south of the Madison/St. Francois County line.  Three homes were damaged and three machine sheds were destroyed, as well as thousands of trees snapped or uprooted.  The width of the damage path in this area was half a mile and was rated F2.  The tornado then crossed into extreme southeastern St. Francois County near Martin Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Along the Perry County portion of the tornado track, 62 homes were destroyed, 17 had major damage, and 23 received minor damage. Ten of the destroyed homes were mobile homes, and seven that sustained major damage were mobile homes. Three churches were destroyed or heavily damaged. Numerous vehicles were tossed. Over 100 utility poles were broken off. Hundreds of trees were broken off or uprooted. The tornado first touched down at County Road 302 near Friedenburg, where F-1 winds destroyed a barn and partially unroofed a two-story house. There were also downed trees, including a few that fell on a house. As the tornado continued northeast across County Road 316 between Crosstown and Friedenburg, it widened to about 100 yards. Scores of trees were broken off or uprooted, and the roof was blown off a house. The tornado strengthened to F-3 intensity as it reached the junction of Highways P and C in Crosstown. The roof was torn off a church, windows were broken, and other structural damage occurred. Nearby, the roof was blown off a two-story brick store that was over 100 years old. An overturned vehicle was in the front yard, and trees were mangled. The width increased to 220 yards. In the center of Crosstown on Highway C, the tornado reached F-4 intensity. This is where a site-built house was levelled. The F-4 damage continued east along County Road 350 in Crosstown, where two more site-built houses were levelled. Only the bolted-down floor of one residence remained. An eyewitness along County Road 350 stated he took shelter in the basement after seeing fog coming directly toward him. His house remained mostly intact, except for the roof and garage. The tornado weakened to F-3 intensity about one to two miles east of Crosstown, where a modular home was destroyed except for the bathroom. A vehicle was tossed in the yard. The weakening trend continued east along County Road 350 to the Mississippi River, where many trees were uprooted and broken off. Some outbuildings were thrown around. The path width decreased to 75 yards as the intensity lowered to F-1. The average path width was 150 yards. There were five injuries requiring medical attention, including one broken arm. Two people were moderately injured when the vehicle they were driving was tossed into a house. Dozens of other residents received minor injuries but did not seek medical attention. Where the tornado crossed the Mississippi River, a barge loaded with coal was pushed to the shoreline. The windows were blown out of the tug boat, and enough coal was blown into the tug boat that it was shovelled out. The tornado crossed the Mississippi River into Jackson County, Illinois.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Scores of trees were broken off or uprooted, and the roof was blown off a house. The tornado strengthened to F-3 intensity as it reached the junction of Highways P and C in Crosstown. The roof was torn off a church, windows were broken, and other structural damage occurred. Nearby, the roof was blown off a two-story brick store that was over 100 years old. An overturned vehicle was in the front yard, and trees were mangled. The width increased to 220 yards. In the center of Crosstown on Highway C, the tornado reached F-4 intensity. This is where a site-built house was levelled. The F-4 damage continued east along County Road 350 in Crosstown, where two more site-built houses were levelled. Only the bolted-down floor of one residence remained. An eyewitness along County Road 350 stated he took shelter in the basement after seeing fog coming directly toward him. His house remained mostly intact, except for the roof and garage. The tornado weakened to F-3 intensity about one to two miles east of Crosstown, where a modular home was destroyed except for the bathroom. A vehicle was tossed in the yard. The weakening trend continued east along County Road 350 to the Mississippi River, where many trees were uprooted and broken off. Some outbuildings were thrown around. The path width decreased to 75 yards as the intensity lowered to F-1. The average path width was 150 yards. There were five injuries requiring medical attention, including one broken arm. Two people were moderately injured when the vehicle they were driving was tossed into a house. Dozens of other residents received minor injuries but did not seek medical attention. Where the tornado crossed the Mississippi River, a barge loaded with coal was pushed to the shoreline. The windows were blown out of the tug boat, and enough coal was blown into the tug boat that it was shovelled out. The tornado crossed the Mississippi River into Jackson County, Illinois.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado weakened from its maximum F-4 intensity to F-2 intensity by the time it entered Jackson County in the Mississippi River bottomlands near Wilkinson Island. At this location, the wall of an old two-story farmhouse was blown out, and the roof was blown off. Hundreds of trees were broken off. Tree damage was visible across the river in Perry County, Missouri. The path width was estimated to be 200 yards wide on the Jackson County side of the river. Before reaching Illinois Route 3, the F-2 tornado widened to 250 yards and destroyed a mobile home. A resident of the mobile home was sent to the hospital. Nearby, a house was unroofed, and trees were snapped or uprooted. Another house lost a room that was added on. A swing set was blown 200 yards and wrapped around a mailbox. An empty tractor trailer rig was overturned. An empty grain bin was blown 100 yards into a field. Full grain bins were severely damaged but remained in place. The roof was blown off a brick house. As the tornado crossed Route 3, high tension utility poles were snapped off, hundreds of acres of corn were flattened, and trees were uprooted. Route 3 was closed for nine hours. From Route 3, the tornado proceeded east-northeast through mostly rural areas of the county, including the Kinkaid Lake State Wildlife Area. The tornado weakened to F-0 intensity before reaching Kinkaid Lake. At the Kinkaid Lake marina, about 50 RV's and boats were damaged, and trees were broken off. The tornado finally lifted shortly after crossing Highway 127 north of Murphysboro. The damage along Highway 127 was about 75 yards wide and consisted of broken tree limbs. A state trooper videotaped the tornado before it lifted. Storm chasers also videotaped the tornado. Peak winds where F-2 damage occurred in western Jackson County were estimated near 150 MPH. The average path width was about 150 yards. A total of about six homes were destroyed or severely damaged, and a dozen others were damaged to a lesser degree. Dozens of other non-residential buildings, such as garages, sheds, barns, and carports, were destroyed. Along the path, striations were evident in fields, and scores of utility poles were snapped off. There were numerous reports of debris falling from the sky in neighboring Perry County, Illinois. Debris as large as pieces of siding and roofing was reported in Du Quoin.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 800K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado tossed a car and 2 pickups up to 50 feet at the same farm. Another non life threatening injury occurred southeast of Wolsey, again on a farm where the house and all buildings were destroyed. Several vehicles were destroyed or damaged. The tornado killed 10 head of cattle at one farmstead just south of Wolsey. The tornado snapped off numerous power poles, caused widespread tree damage, and severely damaged a bridge where it crossed U.S. Highway 14. The tornado also caused crop damage, but the amount of crop damage was not known.

One of the destroyed houses and several destroyed small buildings were on a farmstead 2 miles south of Wessington, and five large high voltage transmission towers were blown down about 3 miles southeast of Wessington. A woman was cut on the neck at one farm southwest of Wolsey where the house and all other buildings were destroyed; the injury was not life threatening. The tornado tossed a car and 2 pickups up to 50 feet at the same farm. Another non life threatening injury occurred southeast of Wolsey, again on a farm where the house and all buildings were destroyed. Several vehicles were destroyed or damaged. The tornado killed 10 head of cattle at one farmstead just south of Wolsey. The tornado snapped off numerous power poles, caused widespread tree damage, and severely damaged a bridge where it crossed U.S. Highway 14. The tornado also caused crop damage, but the amount of crop damage was not known. The tornado dissipated one and a half miles southwest of Huron.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This strong weather system developed as a very strong jet stream, with winds between 160-200 mph, slammed into Oregon and Washington State. All that energy moved over the Rocky Mountains and caused a strong area of surface low pressure to develop. This low intensified as it moved east across the Red River Valley and then lifted across Arkansas and into Tennessee as it deepened to 990 mb! The strength of this deepening low caused warm and unstable air to lift northward across Louisiana and into central Mississippi. It was this northward moving warm front that became the focus of an area where tornadic supercell thunderstorms could thrive in an unstable and highly sheared environment.|This large and powerful storm system produced numerous tornadoes across the south and south eastern United States where many were of the strong (F2 or F3) variety. Within the Jackson, MS forecast area, there were a total of 5 tornadoes to impact the counties serviced. Two F3s, one in Lamar County and the other in Jones County. The Jones County tornado actually contained a satellite tornado, F1, which briefly rotated around the parent tornado. Next was an F1 tornado in southern Marion County which was actually the end of a strong tornado that moved out of Walthall County. Lastly, a brief F1 tornado occurred in central Lamar County. Tornadoes were not the only type of severe weather, scattered wind damage also occurred across northeast Louisiana and portions of central Mississippi between midnight and 10 am Wednesday November 15th 2006.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This strong tornado touched down near the Glade and Tuckers Crossing Communities and tracked east northeast to near the Mill Creek Community before entering Wayne County near Highway 84. Around 25 homes suffered significant damage. The most intense damage was along a path from near the intersection of Highway 15 and Orange Drive northeast to the area along Township Road. Two metal high tension electric power truss towers were destroyed, hundreds of trees were snapped and uprooted, at least two mobile homes were destroyed, a travel trailer being used for post-Katrina housing was annihilated, and several houses suffered significant structural damage. Northeast of this area, the path continued all the way to the county line with Wayne County, but damage was generally less, F0 to occasionally F1, and limited to tree damage. The one exception was near the Mill Creek community, where a storage building was destroyed and a couple of homes suffered roof damage. Total path length across Jones and Wayne Counties was 17 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.70M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This strong weather system developed as a very strong jet stream, with winds between 160-200 mph, slammed into Oregon and Washington State. All that energy moved over the Rocky Mountains and caused a strong area of surface low pressure to develop. This low intensified as it moved east across the Red River Valley and then lifted across Arkansas and into Tennessee as it deepened to 990 mb! The strength of this deepening low caused warm and unstable air to lift northward across Louisiana and into central Mississippi. It was this northward moving warm front that became the focus of an area where tornadic supercell thunderstorms could thrive in an unstable and highly sheared environment.|This large and powerful storm system produced numerous tornadoes across the south and south eastern United States where many were of the strong (F2 or F3) variety. Within the Jackson, MS forecast area, there were a total of 5 tornadoes to impact the counties serviced. Two F3s, one in Lamar County and the other in Jones County. The Jones County tornado actually contained a satellite tornado, F1, which briefly rotated around the parent tornado. Next was an F1 tornado in southern Marion County which was actually the end of a strong tornado that moved out of Walthall County. Lastly, a brief F1 tornado occurred in central Lamar County. Tornadoes were not the only type of severe weather, scattered wind damage also occurred across northeast Louisiana and portions of central Mississippi between midnight and 10 am Wednesday November 15th 2006.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This strong tornado touched down to the southwest of Sumrall and tracked east northeast across northern Lamar County and then into a small portion of extreme northwest Forrest County before dissipating. Approximately 25 homes were damaged, 16 of those suffering major damage or total destruction. The worst damage was along Old Salt Road, where a wood frame home on a concrete block foundation was totally destroyed, with the foundation cleared and the remnants of the home displaced dozens of yards away. A minivan was picked up and thrown/rolled a distance of approximately 150 yards, landing on top of a tractor and totally destroyed. Some large trees at this location were snapped at the base, denuded, and partially debarked. Heavy damage of F2 intensity was also observed along Foster Road, JD Hatten Road, and Rocky Branch road. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted, and a few frame homes totally lost their roofs. Other damage along the path was weaker and generally of F1 intensity.

The ground became saturated on the 15th due to scattered convection before the more organized thunderstorms moved into the area shortly after midnight. These storms produced heavy rainfall due to their training nature. A brief break occurred during mid-day which allowed area creeks and bayous to recede before the onset of additional afternoon rainfall.

Very high shear and low instability created an environment favorable for tornadoes.  A strong surface low pressure system and warm front located in southern North Texas increased the probablitity for low-level rotation.  In addition to tornadoes, severe reports of large hail and flash flooding were widespread.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The National Weather Service in Fort Worth conducted a damage survey and found that the tornado which originated in Hill County continued on its destructive northeast path into Johnson County.  Damage to sheds and vegetation was noted along County Roads 1205 and 1204.  The most significant damage to structures was found near FM 916, CR 1202, and CR 1205, northeast to near Highway 171.  Several structures were unroofed while others suffered partial roof loss.  Major damage to trees was also noted here.  Damage to homes and trees continued along the track near CR 421, CR 423, and CR 415 just north of Highway 4.  The tornado then crossed FM 2415.  The last observed damage was along the south shore of Lake Alvarado.  County officials reported that twenty-two residences were destroyed, twenty were heavily damaged, and twenty more had minor damages.  Ten people were taken to local hospitals.  Most were for minor injuries, but two suffered more serious injuries and were released from the hospital the next day.

Several structures were unroofed while others suffered partial roof loss.  Major damage to trees was also noted here.  Damage to homes and trees continued along the track near CR 421, CR 423, and CR 415 just north of Highway 4.  The tornado then crossed FM 2415.  The last observed damage was along the south shore of Lake Alvarado.  County officials reported that twenty-two residences were destroyed, twenty were heavily damaged, and twenty more had minor damages.  Ten people were taken to local hospitals.  Most were for minor injuries, but two suffered more serious injuries and were released from the hospital the next day.

The tornado then crossed Interstate 85 at Bell Road and continued northeastward to the Atlanta Highway, just west of Taylor Road. Numerous trees were snapped off or downed along the path with minor roof damage to numerous homes. Near the Atlanta Highway, the tornado crossed the A.U.M. ball field complex and struck the Montgomery Postal Processing and Distribution Center and Post Office. The main doors of the post office were blown in and portions of the roof were lifted off to the north. Numerous trees were snapped off at ground level on the south and west sides of the building. A tractor trailer was completely turned around and moved 30 yards and flipped over. Other postal vehicles and cars in the parking lot were moved or received significant damage. Just to the north, the tornado produced major damage to the Fun Zone Skating Rink. This was a large metal building structure which was nearly totally destroyed. Several vehicles were tossed around and significantly damaged or crushed by debris from the building. As the tornado crossed the Atlanta Highway, several metal power poles were either significantly bent or downed. At the Saddleback Ridge Apartment Complex, at least two apartment buildings lost their roofs and portions of the second floor. The tornado continued another 2.25 miles northeastward, ending in a field just south of Wares Ferry Road.

The tornado crossed just across the border into Muscogee county before lifting.  Moderate damage was observed within the Main Post area of Fort Benning along a 150-yard wide, 1.5-mile long path.

The average date for isolated first reports of damaging hail over the past 20 years has been March 24th with the location typically confined to far southeast New Mexico. The March 23rd 2007 episode produced a number of large hail events from Roswell to Tucumcari and peaked with multiple tornadoes from near Tatum north to Clovis and northeast of Tucumcari. A tornado at Clovis resulted in the death of two elderly citizens, the first tornado fatalities in New Mexico since October of 1974. The episode was characterized by a slow moving upper level low that produced strong speed shear but nearly uniform southerly directional flow aloft across the eastern and southeastern sections of the state. Storms with large hail developed first during early and mid afternoon from near Roswell north to Tucumcari. Towards late afternoon and early evening as storms migrated north northeast they encountered an increasing but shallow easterly surface flow that enhanced low level shear resulting in brief but shallow tornadoes.

Damage along the track as it moved over the west side of Logan was intermittent with damage indicators pointing to winds of general 80 to 90 mph with peak winds near the south and north ends of the track estimated at 105 mph. Average track width was around 100 yards. Logan had no tornado siren system but citizens reported nearly 30 to 50 minutes notice of an approaching severe thunderstorm. About a dozen injuries were reported with only two transported to Tucumcari for brief treatment in hospital. Heaviest damage was mainly confined to about 50 manufactured homes and recreational vehicles tossed and rolled mainly on the south end of the lake resort community. Damage to site constructed homes and buildings was limited to window, roof and soffit damage except for one 1910 era frame home that lost its roof.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Additionally, numerous trees, both pines and hardwoods, were snapped and uprooted along with several power lines down along the path. A shop was also destroyed, camper trailer heavily damaged and two other homes suffered significant roof damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado then tracked northeast across William Bill Dannelly Reservoir moving ashore on Sand Island Drive. This is where most of the severe damage occurred with numerous homes damaged or destroyed.|One resident had arrived at his home on the lake to eat lunch when the tornado hit and he was killed when his newer model manufactured home was destroyed. The straps holding the home down all snapped in the same place. He was thrown out of his home and later found in the debris. Neighbors next door had sought shelter in an underground storm shelter outside their house seconds before the tornado hit. When they safely emerged from the shelter, they found their home destroyed. Most of the homes on Sand Island are vacation homes with part-time residents. If the tornado had struck on the weekend when more people are present, the loss of life would likely have been greater.|Around 40 homes(four of these were slab homes)were damaged or destroyed along Sand Island Drive with some of the debris scattered up to two miles downstream. The tornado continued quickly to the northeast through sparsely populated areas. Damage did occur to homes and hunting camps along this path. However, the damage here was only rated as EF-0 and EF-1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  The tornado crossed into Dallas County.|In all, one person died and two people were slightly injured by the tornado. The injuries occurred along Sand Island Drive when a single wide trailer was destroyed with the occupants being thrown from the trailer. They were protected from flying debris by part of the trailer that had fallen on top of them. The highest wind speed of the tornado was estimated at 185 mph.|<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One of these thunderstorms produced a significant tornado in Wilcox County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A significant tornado first touched down around 1227 pm at State Highway 28 near Miller's Ferry dam. The tornado then tracked northeast across William Bill Dannelly Reservoir moving ashore on Sand Island Drive. This is where most of the severe damage occurred with numerous homes damaged or destroyed.|One resident had arrived at his home on the lake to eat lunch when the tornado hit and he was killed when his newer model manufactured home was destroyed. The straps holding the home down all snapped in the same place. He was thrown out of his home and later found in the debris. Neighbors next door had sought shelter in an underground storm shelter outside their house seconds before the tornado hit. When they safely emerged from the shelter, they found their home destroyed. Most of the homes on Sand Island are vacation homes with part-time residents. If the tornado had struck on the weekend when more people are present, the loss of life would likely have been greater.|Around 40 homes(four of these were slab homes)were damaged or destroyed along Sand Island Drive with some of the debris scattered up to two miles downstream. The tornado continued quickly to the northeast through sparsely populated areas. Damage did occur to homes and hunting camps along this path. However, the damage here was only rated as EF-0 and EF-1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  The tornado crossed into Dallas County.|In all, one person died and two people were slightly injured by the tornado. The injuries occurred along Sand Island Drive when a single wide trailer was destroyed with the occupants being thrown from the trailer. They were protected from flying debris by part of the trailer that had fallen on top of them. The highest wind speed of the tornado was estimated at 185 mph.|<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

During the afternoon hours, thunderstorms began to show brief, but persistent signs of rotation, that later resulted in three tornadoes. The most significant tornado of the day struck the western Oklahoma City metro area, producing EF2 damage. Other tornadoes were reported near Okeene, and over northwest Garfield county. Damage was reported with each of these thunderstorms, which included roof damage, tree and power line damage, and automobile accidents. No fatalities were reported, but five direct injuries were reported in western Oklahoma City.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado developed around 1505 CST near the intersection of NW 39th Street and Sara Road in western Oklahoma City, and moved north northeast. In this area several homes suffered roof and garage door damage. The tornado continued north along and just west of the Kilpatrick Turnpike. Significant damage was noted along NW 63rd Street, where a home was heavily damaged, several travel trailers and a boat were rolled and damaged. Several vehicles were also pushed by the wind.|Another area of significant damage was noted along Wilshire Blvd., just west of the Kilpatrick Turnpike. In this area a travel trailer was destroyed, with additional damage to a home and several outbuildings. Two people were directly injured in the travel trailer. In addition, several hardwood trees were snapped, indicative of EF2 damage.|The tornado appeared to have been at its widest toward the end of its path along Morgan Road just north of NW 122nd Street, and it was at this point along the path where the intensity appeared to have been at its highest. Several homes sustained significant roof and siding damage and several wooden power poles were snapped. A metal building was severely damaged. Just to the east of this location, three large electrical transmission towers were damaged.

During the afternoon hours, thunderstorms began to show brief, but persistent signs of rotation, that later resulted in three tornadoes. The most significant tornado of the day struck the western Oklahoma City metro area, producing EF2 damage. Other tornadoes were reported near Okeene, and over northwest Garfield county. Damage was reported with each of these thunderstorms, which included roof damage, tree and power line damage, and automobile accidents. No fatalities were reported, but five direct injuries were reported in western Oklahoma City.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado developed around 1505 CST near the intersection of NW 39th Street and Sara Road in western Oklahoma City, and moved north northeast. In this area several homes suffered roof and garage door damage. The tornado continued north along and just west of the Kilpatrick Turnpike. Significant damage was noted along NW 63rd Street, where a home was heavily damaged, several travel trailers and a boat were rolled and damaged. Several vehicles were also pushed by the wind.|Another area of significant damage was noted along Wilshire Blvd., just west of the Kilpatrick Turnpike. In this area a travel trailer was destroyed, with additional damage to a home and several outbuildings. Two people were directly injured in the travel trailer. In addition, several hardwood trees were snapped, indicative of EF2 damage.|The tornado appeared to have been at its widest toward the end of its path along Morgan Road just north of NW 122nd Street, and it was at this point along the path where the intensity appeared to have been at its highest. Several homes sustained significant roof and siding damage and several wooden power poles were snapped. A metal building was severely damaged. Just to the east of this location, three large electrical transmission towers were damaged. Spotty light damage continued a little further north before the tornado dissipated along Morgan Road north of Memorial Road at 1525 CST. Three additional people were directly injured on the Kilpatrick Turnpike. This EF2 tornado injured 5 people and caused an estimated half of a million dollars in damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The average date for isolated first reports of damaging hail over the past 20 years has been March 24th with the location typically confined to far southeast New Mexico. The March 23rd 2007 episode produced a number of large hail events from Roswell to Tucumcari and peaked with multiple tornadoes from near Tatum north to Clovis and northeast of Tucumcari. A tornado at Clovis resulted in the death of two elderly citizens, the first tornado fatalities in New Mexico since October of 1974. The episode was characterized by a slow moving upper level low that produced strong speed shear but nearly uniform southerly directional flow aloft across the eastern and southeastern sections of the state. Storms with large hail developed first during early and mid afternoon from near Roswell north to Tucumcari. Towards late afternoon and early evening as storms migrated north northeast they encountered an increasing but shallow easterly surface flow that enhanced low level shear resulting in brief but shallow tornadoes. Multiple small but elevated vortices were observed circulating around well defined wall clouds with occasional spin downs into brief tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado that developed in Roosevelt County continued north northwest into Curry County for about 3.5 miles then tracked north northeast an additional 4.6 miles into southern and east central sections of Clovis. Intensity of the tornado appeared to wane from EF2 120 mph in Roosevelt County to EF1 100 mph as it moved north into Curry County along Highway 70 where damage was limited to power lines and farm irrigation equipment. Intensity increased again to EF2 level 125 mph for a segment extending from about 4 miles south of Clovis northward into southeast Clovis which sustained the heaviest and most consistent damage as indicated by structural damage and downed power poles. The tornado appeared to wane again as it move north over Highway 60/84 just east of the intersection with Highway 70. The tornado track became intermittent north of Highway 60/84 with winds likely less than 85 mph before a final one half mile track of heavier damage and EF2 level winds of 120-125 mph. Average width was estimated at 200 yards. About 500 homes and other facilities sustained at least some damage ranging from complete destruction of mobile homes in southeast Clovis and wall collapse at several businesses along Highway 60/84 to the loss of roof shingles and roof top air conditioning units. Thirty five people suffered treatment injuries including five that required hospitalization.

A 150kt jet was located over the region at 250mb with a strong 50kt low-level jet from central Alabama into central Tennessee.  A wedge of cool air was present over much of north central and northeast Georgia. Rain, which spread over this area early in the day, helped enhance the wedge of cool air.  Little to no severe weather was noted north of the wedge boundary across north Georgia where the air mass remained relatively cool and stable. Meanwhile...a warm, humid air mass was present across much of central and south Georgia where dewpoints had risen well into the 60s during the afternoon.  The strong upper dynamics present over this region combined with the instability just south of the wedge provided a very favorable environment for long lived, strong tornadoes.  A total of 14 tornadoes affecting 17 counties tracked across central and east central Georgia and within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area during the late afternoon and evening hours of March 1st.  This was the second greatest number of tornadoes recorded to have occurred in the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area within a 24-hour period, second only to the 16 tornadoes, affecting 18 counties, associated with Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005.  The March 1st tornadoes spanned an area from Stewart county in the far southwest part of the county warning area to Warren county in the far east central portion of the county warning area.  The first tornado touched down in Stewart county at 4:11 pm EST and the last tornado lifted in Marion county at 10:55 pm EST.  By far the hardest hit county was Sumter county, and especially the city of Americus, where hundreds of homes and business, including the regional hospital, were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Additional tornadoes were reported further south in Tallahassee and Jacksonville's, Florida's forecast areas.  Federal disaster assistance had been approved for 1,836 households across the state for a total of $14.2 million.  Another $5.8 million had been approved for public assistance of debris removal and to repair infrastructure.  The Small Business Association also approved $7 million in disaster assistance loans.  Overall damages, however, are estimated to be several hundred million.|Substantial rainfall fell across much of the state, but rainfall amounts of three to five inches were common across central and east central areas.  The heaviest rainfall fell in the Hancock, Putnam, and Baldwin county areas, where some spots received in excess of six inches of rain.  Some flooding was reported in these areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service in Peachtree City, GA concluded that a strong, violent, and long-lived EF3 tornado tracked across southeast Webster, much of Sumter, and far southern Macon counties.  The tornado touched down near Chambliss on the Webster/Terrell county line and tracked east-northeast exiting the county into Sumter county near Bottsford.  While the overall path length of the tornado was around 40 miles, the path length within Webster county was between seven and eight miles.  While the tornado reached its maximum path width of 1.0 mile in Sumter county near Americus, it was determined to be less than this within Webster county.  A path of significant damage was noted across southeast Webster county.  A concrete block house and two machine shops on East Centerpoint Road just northeast of Chambliss were completely destroyed.  Three injuries resulted from the damage here.  Twenty-five feet of asphalt in front of the home was also ripped up by the tornado.  On a nearby farm, five cows were killed when they were tossed about by the tornado.  A tractor-trailer traveling on Georgia Highway 520 near Chambliss was overturned causing it to catch on fire and burn.  Very nearby, at the intersection of Georgia Highway 520 and TV Tower Road, a 1096 foot Georgia Public Television transmission tower was destroyed when two-thirds of the tower was twisted off by the tornado and destroyed.  Only 150 feet of the 1096 foot tower was left standing after the tornado passed.  Numerous trees and power lines were also down in the area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A 150kt jet was located over the region at 250mb with a strong 50kt low-level jet from central Alabama into central Tennessee.  A wedge of cool air was present over much of north central and northeast Georgia. Rain, which spread over this area early in the day, helped enhance the wedge of cool air.  Little to no severe weather was noted north of the wedge boundary across north Georgia where the air mass remained relatively cool and stable. Meanwhile...a warm, humid air mass was present across much of central and south Georgia where dewpoints had risen well into the 60s during the afternoon.  The strong upper dynamics present over this region combined with the instability just south of the wedge provided a very favorable environment for long lived, strong tornadoes.  A total of 14 tornadoes affecting 17 counties tracked across central and east central Georgia and within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area during the late afternoon and evening hours of March 1st.  This was the second greatest number of tornadoes recorded to have occurred in the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area within a 24-hour period, second only to the 16 tornadoes, affecting 18 counties, associated with Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005.  The March 1st tornadoes spanned an area from Stewart county in the far southwest part of the county warning area to Warren county in the far east central portion of the county warning area.  The first tornado touched down in Stewart county at 4:11 pm EST and the last tornado lifted in Marion county at 10:55 pm EST.  By far the hardest hit county was Sumter county, and especially the city of Americus, where hundreds of homes and business, including the regional hospital, were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Additional tornadoes were reported further south in Tallahassee and Jacksonville's, Florida's forecast areas.  Federal disaster assistance had been approved for 1,836 households across the state for a total of $14.2 million.  Another $5.8 million had been approved for public assistance of debris removal and to repair infrastructure.  The Small Business Association also approved $7 million in disaster assistance loans.  Overall damages, however, are estimated to be several hundred million.|Substantial rainfall fell across much of the state, but rainfall amounts of three to five inches were common across central and east central areas.  The heaviest rainfall fell in the Hancock, Putnam, and Baldwin county areas, where some spots received in excess of six inches of rain.  Some flooding was reported in these areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service in Peachtree City, GA concluded that a strong, violent, and long-lived EF3 tornado tracked across southeast Webster, much of Sumter, and far southern Macon counties.  The tornado touched down near Chambliss on the Webster/Terrell county line and tracked east-northeast exiting the county into Sumter county near Bottsford.  While the overall path length of the tornado was around 40 miles, the path length within Webster county was between seven and eight miles.  While the tornado reached its maximum path width of 1.0 mile in Sumter county near Americus, it was determined to be less than this within Webster county.  A path of significant damage was noted across southeast Webster county.  A concrete block house and two machine shops on East Centerpoint Road just northeast of Chambliss were completely destroyed.  Three injuries resulted from the damage here.  Twenty-five feet of asphalt in front of the home was also ripped up by the tornado.  On a nearby farm, five cows were killed when they were tossed about by the tornado.  A tractor-trailer traveling on Georgia Highway 520 near Chambliss was overturned causing it to catch on fire and burn.  Very nearby, at the intersection of Georgia Highway 520 and TV Tower Road, a 1096 foot Georgia Public Television transmission tower was destroyed when two-thirds of the tower was twisted off by the tornado and destroyed.  Only 150 feet of the 1096 foot tower was left standing after the tornado passed.  Numerous trees and power lines were also down in the area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Reports from west of the Rio Grande indicate that a large and devastating tornado stuck Piedras Negras from the west, then dissipated on the west side of the Rio Grande.  The supercell crossed the Rio Grande near 6:00 pm CST and struck the community of Rosita Valley near 6:01pm CST. Severe outflow winds from the storm estimated at between 80 mph and 100 mph struck the community first, causing minor damage to houses and mobile homes. Roofs were partially lifted, exteriors of homes were damaged, and trees were knocked over. Following the wind damage, hail to the size of golfballs struck the area, along with very heavy rain.|Following the winds and hail, the tornado struck next. The team found the tornado touchdown point approximately one-quarter mile to the southwest of the Rosita Valley Elementary School. It struck a four room home��� destroying the outer walls and leaving only the interior walls standing. This damage was rated as EF-2 damage. The tornado then moved toward the east-northeast, directly toward the school. Along its path it damaged three more homes and destroyed a fourth. Damage to the three homes was rated EF-1 with the destroyed home rated EF-2. The tornado next struck a mobile home, tearing off its frame and tossing the debris into the school building. This also indicated EF-2 damage.  Then the tornado crossed Rosita Valley Road, destroying mobile homes and damaging homes and tossing the debris into the south and west sides of the Rosita Valley Elementary School building. The initial strike points at the school showed only minor EF-0 damage. However damage was severe from the center of the school northeastward. It appeared that the tornadic winds were able to open enough of the center part of the roof to enter the interior of the school. These winds as well as winds that entered through wall openings caused severe damage to the north and south wings of the building. This damage indicated wind speeds approaching 140 mph and damage at EF-3 level. To the northwest of the school were two brick retail buildings; both were well-constructed. Outer walls were destroyed in each with damage to interior walls in one of the structures. This also suggested wind speeds near 140 mph and EF-3 level damage.|Finally as the tornado exited the school area it struck an area of single family houses some 200 yards to the northeast. Most of the houses were swept off their foundations and many of them were completely flattened. This damage suggested wind speeds approaching 150 mph, the highest speeds found at Rosita Valley. This was mid-range EF-3 damage.  In conclusion���the tornado was rated EF-3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale with a path width near one-quarter mile and a path length near four miles.  |In all the tornado destroyed one elementary school, along with 59 manufactured homes and 57 houses.

Reports from west of the Rio Grande indicate that a large and devastating tornado stuck Piedras Negras from the west, then dissipated on the west side of the Rio Grande.  The supercell crossed the Rio Grande near 6:00 pm CST and struck the community of Rosita Valley near 6:01pm CST. Severe outflow winds from the storm estimated at between 80 mph and 100 mph struck the community first, causing minor damage to houses and mobile homes. Roofs were partially lifted, exteriors of homes were damaged, and trees were knocked over. Following the wind damage, hail to the size of golfballs struck the area, along with very heavy rain.|Following the winds and hail, the tornado struck next. The team found the tornado touchdown point approximately one-quarter mile to the southwest of the Rosita Valley Elementary School. It struck a four room home��� destroying the outer walls and leaving only the interior walls standing. This damage was rated as EF-2 damage. The tornado then moved toward the east-northeast, directly toward the school. Along its path it damaged three more homes and destroyed a fourth. Damage to the three homes was rated EF-1 with the destroyed home rated EF-2. The tornado next struck a mobile home, tearing off its frame and tossing the debris into the school building. This also indicated EF-2 damage.  Then the tornado crossed Rosita Valley Road, destroying mobile homes and damaging homes and tossing the debris into the south and west sides of the Rosita Valley Elementary School building. The initial strike points at the school showed only minor EF-0 damage. However damage was severe from the center of the school northeastward. It appeared that the tornadic winds were able to open enough of the center part of the roof to enter the interior of the school. These winds as well as winds that entered through wall openings caused severe damage to the north and south wings of the building. This damage indicated wind speeds approaching 140 mph and damage at EF-3 level. To the northwest of the school were two brick retail buildings; both were well-constructed. Outer walls were destroyed in each with damage to interior walls in one of the structures. This also suggested wind speeds near 140 mph and EF-3 level damage.|Finally as the tornado exited the school area it struck an area of single family houses some 200 yards to the northeast. Most of the houses were swept off their foundations and many of them were completely flattened. This damage suggested wind speeds approaching 150 mph, the highest speeds found at Rosita Valley. This was mid-range EF-3 damage.  In conclusion���the tornado was rated EF-3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale with a path width near one-quarter mile and a path length near four miles.  |In all the tornado destroyed one elementary school, along with 59 manufactured homes and 57 houses.  Major damage was reported to 21 manufactured homes and 19 houses with minor damage to10 manufactured homes, 22 houses, and 9 apartments.  There were seven deaths in Rosita Valley as a result of the tornado.  A family of five in one mobile home were killed as it was destroyed and rolled into the Rosita Valley Elementary School.  Two other victims were found, one in a permanent home that had collapsed and one in another mobile home.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 80.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The west Texas South Plains and the extreme southern Texas Panhandle were affected by a series of significant tornadoes. At least five tornadoes were spawned by a single cyclic supercell thunderstorm that resulted in more than $3.5 million in damages.|The most severely impacted communities included Olton (Lamb County) and Tulia (Swisher County). Both of these west Texas towns were impacted by EF-2 tornadoes that destroyed property and injured four people, and more than 14,000 customers were without electrical power throughout the night.|The tornado outbreak was caused by a potent storm system that progressed east over the Four Corners region of the western U.S. on the 21st. A potent upper level jet stream spread over the Southern Plains of the U.S., and helped to create a favorable environment for supercell thunderstorms and tornadoes along a dryline that was stretched across west Texas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A strong tornado delivered a crippling impact on the local economy of Tulia, Texas, when it devastated industrial and residential sections of the small community of 5,000 residents around 19:00 CST on the 21st. A two block wide swath of damage paralleled U.S. Highway 87 in west Tulia for fifteen blocks. Three persons were treated at area hospitals for injuries, almost thirty homes sustained damage or were destroyed along with twenty businesses, and approximately five hundred people were displaced or made homeless.|Local officials and newspaper accounts indicated that several of the businesses that were heavily damaged during the tornado served as staples to the Tulia economy prior to the storm. U.S. President George W. Bush declared Swisher County a federal disaster area on May 1, 2007. |This destructive tornado developed near a power plant at the intersection of Broadway Street and U.S. Highway 87 in west Tulia at 18:57 CST. The tornado moved north and caused extensive damage to a local supermarket at the intersection of U.S. Highway 87 and |Sixth Street. A large portion of the roof was removed on the east side of the structure, and one exterior wall collapsed inward. Smaller sections of two additional exterior walls additionally collapsed. |A local auto dealership, located near the supermarket, also sustained a large amount of structural and inventory damage. Forty-one vehicles were damaged by flying debris, and a motor home on the property was overturned. A large overhead door on the east side of the structure's show room failed, resulting in the failure of the west wall. A large storage container was blown into the southwest corner of the building and caused the partial collapse of the roof.|Several large metal industrial-style buildings sustained major damage due to the failure of large overhead doors and buckling of roof purlins on the south side of the buildings. One such structure collapsed onto a collection of classic cars, and resulted in a $250,000 loss. |Two storm chasers escaped injuries when they were struck by the tornado along the industrial stretch of U.S. Highway 87. Their vehicle was blown into a brick building, and then a tractor-trailer was blown broadside against the chase vehicle.|Damage also was observed to the north and northeast of the industrial area, with severe damage in residential areas including a mobile home community between Eighth and Ninth Streets just west of Highland Elementary School. Five mobile homes were damaged, with two others completely destroyed. |The most significant residential damage occurred in a subdivision along Northwest Ninth Street through Northwest Eleventh Street. Across this area, a number of homes suffered roof losses. Roofs were totally removed from at least two single-family homes on Tenth Street near Airport Road, with partial exterior wall collapses also noted.  |The tornado dissipated near the Tulia Municipal Airport at 19:01 CST.|Meteorologists from the National Weather Service in Lubbock, Texas, Texas Tech University, and engineers from numerous private and governmental agencies surveyed the Tulia damage. All indications suggest that the maximum winds with the Tulia tornado were between 125 and 135 mph. This makes the Tulia tornado an EF-2 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale for tornado intensity. The total economic loss is estimated at $2.0 million.|<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A potent upper level jet stream spread over the Southern Plains of the U.S., and helped to create a favorable environment for supercell thunderstorms and tornadoes along a dryline that was stretched across west Texas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A strong tornado delivered a crippling impact on the local economy of Tulia, Texas, when it devastated industrial and residential sections of the small community of 5,000 residents around 19:00 CST on the 21st. A two block wide swath of damage paralleled U.S. Highway 87 in west Tulia for fifteen blocks. Three persons were treated at area hospitals for injuries, almost thirty homes sustained damage or were destroyed along with twenty businesses, and approximately five hundred people were displaced or made homeless.|Local officials and newspaper accounts indicated that several of the businesses that were heavily damaged during the tornado served as staples to the Tulia economy prior to the storm. U.S. President George W. Bush declared Swisher County a federal disaster area on May 1, 2007. |This destructive tornado developed near a power plant at the intersection of Broadway Street and U.S. Highway 87 in west Tulia at 18:57 CST. The tornado moved north and caused extensive damage to a local supermarket at the intersection of U.S. Highway 87 and |Sixth Street. A large portion of the roof was removed on the east side of the structure, and one exterior wall collapsed inward. Smaller sections of two additional exterior walls additionally collapsed. |A local auto dealership, located near the supermarket, also sustained a large amount of structural and inventory damage. Forty-one vehicles were damaged by flying debris, and a motor home on the property was overturned. A large overhead door on the east side of the structure's show room failed, resulting in the failure of the west wall. A large storage container was blown into the southwest corner of the building and caused the partial collapse of the roof.|Several large metal industrial-style buildings sustained major damage due to the failure of large overhead doors and buckling of roof purlins on the south side of the buildings. One such structure collapsed onto a collection of classic cars, and resulted in a $250,000 loss. |Two storm chasers escaped injuries when they were struck by the tornado along the industrial stretch of U.S. Highway 87. Their vehicle was blown into a brick building, and then a tractor-trailer was blown broadside against the chase vehicle.|Damage also was observed to the north and northeast of the industrial area, with severe damage in residential areas including a mobile home community between Eighth and Ninth Streets just west of Highland Elementary School. Five mobile homes were damaged, with two others completely destroyed. |The most significant residential damage occurred in a subdivision along Northwest Ninth Street through Northwest Eleventh Street. Across this area, a number of homes suffered roof losses. Roofs were totally removed from at least two single-family homes on Tenth Street near Airport Road, with partial exterior wall collapses also noted.  |The tornado dissipated near the Tulia Municipal Airport at 19:01 CST.|Meteorologists from the National Weather Service in Lubbock, Texas, Texas Tech University, and engineers from numerous private and governmental agencies surveyed the Tulia damage. All indications suggest that the maximum winds with the Tulia tornado were between 125 and 135 mph. This makes the Tulia tornado an EF-2 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale for tornado intensity. The total economic loss is estimated at $2.0 million.|<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado traveled east-northeast across Turkey Creek Church Road, lifting approximately 5.5 miles south-southeast of Dublin near the Oconee River.  The tornado had a path length of approximately six miles and a maximum path width of 200 yards.  Maximum wind speeds were estimated at 120 mph.  Most of the damage caused by the tornado was along Turkey Creek Church Road between U.S. Highway 441 and the Oconee River.  A tied-down double-wide mobile home was completely destroyed along Turkey Creek Church Road resulting in two injuries.  Another tied-down mobile home was destroyed in the same area with two adults and two children inside.  All occupants survived, but one sustained minor injuries.  The carport of a site-built home was removed as well as a portion of the roof.  Several other mobile homes and site-built homes sustained minor damage from wind and fallen trees.  A large greenhouse was also destroyed.  A number of trees and power lines were down all along the path of the tornado.

A 150kt jet was located over the region at 250mb with a strong 50kt low-level jet from central Alabama into central Tennessee.  A wedge of cool air was present over much of north central and northeast Georgia. Rain, which spread over this area early in the day, helped enhance the wedge of cool air.  Little to no severe weather was noted north of the wedge boundary across north Georgia where the air mass remained relatively cool and stable. Meanwhile...a warm, humid air mass was present across much of central and south Georgia where dewpoints had risen well into the 60s during the afternoon.  The strong upper dynamics present over this region combined with the instability just south of the wedge provided a very favorable environment for long lived, strong tornadoes.  A total of 14 tornadoes affecting 17 counties tracked across central and east central Georgia and within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area during the late afternoon and evening hours of March 1st.  This was the second greatest number of tornadoes recorded to have occurred in the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area within a 24-hour period, second only to the 16 tornadoes, affecting 18 counties, associated with Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005.  The March 1st tornadoes spanned an area from Stewart county in the far southwest part of the county warning area to Warren county in the far east central portion of the county warning area.  The first tornado touched down in Stewart county at 4:11 pm EST and the last tornado lifted in Marion county at 10:55 pm EST.  By far the hardest hit county was Sumter county, and especially the city of Americus, where hundreds of homes and business, including the regional hospital, were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Additional tornadoes were reported further south in Tallahassee and Jacksonville's, Florida's forecast areas.  Federal disaster assistance had been approved for 1,836 households across the state for a total of $14.2 million.  Another $5.8 million had been approved for public assistance of debris removal and to repair infrastructure.  The Small Business Association also approved $7 million in disaster assistance loans.  Overall damages, however, are estimated to be several hundred million.|Substantial rainfall fell across much of the state, but rainfall amounts of three to five inches were common across central and east central areas.  The heaviest rainfall fell in the Hancock, Putnam, and Baldwin county areas, where some spots received in excess of six inches of rain.  Some flooding was reported in these areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service in Peachtree City, Georgia concluded that the EF3 tornado that first touched down in southeast Webster county continued to track northeast from the southwest to the northeast corner of Sumter county and then continued into extreme southern Macon county before finally lifting.  The tornado tracked a total distance on the ground of approximately 40 miles.  The tornado entered Sumter county about 4.75 miles southwest of Plains in southwest Sumter county and exited the northeast part of the county about 9 miles north of Methvins in northeast Sumter county.  This was by far the most violent and devastating tornado of the March 1st outbreak.  The tornado tracked roughly 32 miles across Sumter county with a maximum path width of 1.0 mile wide, which occurred in the Americus area.  Damage within the city of Americus was extensive, although structures, trees, and power lines were down along the entire path of the tornado.  The most significant damage in Americus was to the Sumter Regional Hospital, of which a significant portion was destroyed.  Hundreds of homes and businesses in the Americus area were either totally destroyed or sustained significant damage.  Hunderds of vehicles were also damaged or destroyed by debris and/or tossed about like matchsticks.  The majority of the damage was within the vicinity of the Sumter Regional Hospital.  Two deaths were reported at a home in Americus when a wall collapsed on a 43 year-old male and a 53-year old female.  At least eight injuries were documented, but there may have been more.||Within the city of Americus, proper, there were 1235 total structures damaged or destroyed, including 217 businesses, 993 residences, 3 cemeteries, 10 churches, 1 fire station, 1 hospital, 8 recreational facilities/parks, and 2 schools.

Both of these west Texas towns were impacted by EF-2 tornadoes that destroyed property and injured four people, and more than 14,000 customers were without electrical power throughout the night.|The tornado outbreak was caused by a potent storm system that progressed east over the Four Corners region of the western U.S. on the 21st.

Total damages from the tornado were estimated to exceed $1.2 million, and one person was injured. |The development of this significant tornado was witnessed by storm chasers between Fieldton and Otlon at 17:57 CST. A National Weather Service damage survey team noted that the first damages to occur as a result of the tornado included five medium voltage power poles downed just east of the intersection of Farm to Market Road 168 and County Road 162.

At this location, a historic multi-story house that was originally constructed in 1913 suffered severe roof damage. A portion of the roof was blown off of the structure toward the southeast. The owners of the home were within days of completing a two year-long renovation. In addition, the skirting was removed from a mobile home across the street from the historic home. Several outbuildings near the residence also sustained minor damage.|The tornado continued northeastward and destroyed several more center pivot irrigation systems and snapped utility poles three to five feet above the ground along County Road 321. The tornado's damage path was measured at seven-tenths of a mile wide in this area. |As the tornadic circulation crossed U.S. Highway 70 two miles east of Olton, four homes were heavily damaged.

The warm front was part of a large upper level system that brought several days of severe weather and flooding to the region. |Heavy rain and flooding was reported with some of the activity Saturday morning, along with isolated severe thunderstorm reports.  However, during the afternoon the severe weather became more widespread over northeast Nebraska where supercells spawned several tornadoes.  At this time, thunderstorms, some severe with heavy rain, produced flash flooding over parts of southeast Nebraska.  By evening the severe weather, including supercell producing tornadoes, shifted into southwest Iowa, although isolated severe thunderstorms persisted over parts of eastern Nebraska until after midnight cdt.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A grain bin was damaged as this tornado initially touched down along with two or three large power line support structures northwest of Crofton.  The tornado tracked toward Lewis and Clark Lake taking the roof off of a house and destroying a garage.  The tornado also caused other roof damage as it continued tracking toward Lewis and Clark Lake.  When it reached the lake it caused significant damage to a recreation area and marina.  The tornado also caused 3 minor injuries when it apparently lifted a large SUV off the ground and carried it a hundred feet or so before setting it down with the windows blown in.

The tornado also caused other roof damage as it continued tracking toward Lewis and Clark Lake.  When it reached the lake it caused significant damage to a recreation area and marina.  The tornado also caused 3 minor injuries when it apparently lifted a large SUV off the ground and carried it a hundred feet or so before setting it down with the windows blown in.

A dry line had become established and was located along the Oklahoma and Texas panhandle border. Also, favorable upper level winds were rotating around the upper level storm system, crossing the dryline over western Oklahoma. As the afternoon progressed, convergence along the dryline became maximized over this area. Thunderstorms developed during the afternoon hours and they quickly became supercells.  Two of the supercells produced several tornadoes.  The northern tornadic storm produced five tornadoes from southwest of Roll to just east of Arnett.  The southern tornadic storm also produced five tornadoes in Oklahoma from near Sweetwater to near Sharon. Large hail was also observed. The supercells moved northeast out of Oklahoma during the late evening hours. Monetary values for the tornado damage were estimated.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the first tornado that occurred in Oklahoma with the southern tornadic supercell.  The tornado appears to have developed 1/2 mile north of E1130 road and along Highway 30 in northern Beckham County, about 2 1/2 miles south of Sweetwater. The first evidence of a tornado was damage to an outbuilding at a gas facility on the west side of the highway along with some tree damage. The tornado moved north along and parallel to Highway 30, damaging trees, homes and some outbuildings. Damage in this area was mainly in the EF0 range. ||The most significant damage occurred when the tornado struck the Sweetwater school. At this location, the tornado is estimated to have been 100-150 yards wide. The most significant damage was to a metal building that was the school\`s multi-purpose building, which was almost completely destroyed. The anchoring that connected the building to the foundation appeared to have failed, allowing all but the most northern section of the building to collapse. A small building that connected this building with the school\`s gymnasium suffered only slight damage. The gymnasium, at the northwest corner of the school, suffered substantial roof damage, which appeared to have caused the west masonry wall of the school to collapse outward. ||Other damage on the school property consisted of a small storage building of similar construction as the multi-purpose building being completely destroyed, a bus barn/garage structure suffering damage when the large garage doors blew inward, and damage to trees, power lines and fences. ||A pick up truck, which had been parked in the school\`s parking lot, was rolled/tossed approximately 100 yards to the north. A horse trailer that had been near the storage building at the southwest edge of the school property was found more than one quarter mile away in a field. ||A man suffered minor injuries near this location.||Just north of the school, a home was damaged and an oil storage facility was also hit. An oil tank from this location was found approximately 500 yards away. ||Several animals were killed when a garage was destroyed. A RV was also destroyed.

A dry line had become established and was located along the Oklahoma and Texas panhandle border. Also, favorable upper level winds were rotating around the upper level storm system, crossing the dryline over western Oklahoma. As the afternoon progressed, convergence along the dryline became maximized over this area. Thunderstorms developed during the afternoon hours and they quickly became supercells.  Two of the supercells produced several tornadoes.  The northern tornadic storm produced five tornadoes from southwest of Roll to just east of Arnett.  The southern tornadic storm also produced five tornadoes in Oklahoma from near Sweetwater to near Sharon. Large hail was also observed. The supercells moved northeast out of Oklahoma during the late evening hours. Monetary values for the tornado damage were estimated.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the first tornado that occurred in Oklahoma with the southern tornadic supercell.  The tornado appears to have developed 1/2 mile north of E1130 road and along Highway 30 in northern Beckham County, about 2 1/2 miles south of Sweetwater. The first evidence of a tornado was damage to an outbuilding at a gas facility on the west side of the highway along with some tree damage. The tornado moved north along and parallel to Highway 30, damaging trees, homes and some outbuildings. Damage in this area was mainly in the EF0 range. ||The most significant damage occurred when the tornado struck the Sweetwater school. At this location, the tornado is estimated to have been 100-150 yards wide. The most significant damage was to a metal building that was the school\`s multi-purpose building, which was almost completely destroyed. The anchoring that connected the building to the foundation appeared to have failed, allowing all but the most northern section of the building to collapse. A small building that connected this building with the school\`s gymnasium suffered only slight damage. The gymnasium, at the northwest corner of the school, suffered substantial roof damage, which appeared to have caused the west masonry wall of the school to collapse outward. ||Other damage on the school property consisted of a small storage building of similar construction as the multi-purpose building being completely destroyed, a bus barn/garage structure suffering damage when the large garage doors blew inward, and damage to trees, power lines and fences. ||A pick up truck, which had been parked in the school\`s parking lot, was rolled/tossed approximately 100 yards to the north. A horse trailer that had been near the storage building at the southwest edge of the school property was found more than one quarter mile away in a field. ||A man suffered minor injuries near this location.||Just north of the school, a home was damaged and an oil storage facility was also hit. An oil tank from this location was found approximately 500 yards away. ||Several animals were killed when a garage was destroyed. A RV was also destroyed. Numerous cars and school buses were damaged/destroyed. ||The damage to the multi-purpose building at the Sweetwater school is consistent with damage at the low end of the EF-3 scale. The remainder of the damage was primarily in the EF0-EF1 category.||The tornado continued and crossed into Roger Mills County.

At 6 pm CST, a surface low was located over southern Manitoba (Canada), just north of Pembina, ND. The cold front stretched to the southwest, back toward Devils Lake (ND) and Bismarck (ND). Ahead of the cold front, temperatures ranged in the low to mid 80s with dew points around 70F. Behind the front, temperatures did not cool significantly, but dew points dropped to the mid 40s. Thunderstorms began to form along and ahead of the cold front by early evening (from northeast ND into south central ND), eventually crossing into northwest Minnesota several hours later. Eight distinct tornadoes occurred over northeast North Dakota and northwest Minnesota during this event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down about 2 miles west-southwest of Northwood. The tornado crossed the Goose River about a mile west-southwest of the Northwood airport and left a 200 yard wide stretch of downed trees in its wake. By the time it hit the airport, the ground track was one-third of a mile wide and growing wider. At this point the tornado was still visible outside the increasingly heavy rain. ||The tornado reached an incredible width of eight-tenths of a mile as it pushed through Northwood to the east-northeast. At this point it had multiple vortices embedded in the overall wedge shaped tornado. The strongest of these vortices appears to have scoured the ground and left broad circulation patterns of debris in the overall damage and debris field. Around this time the tornado likely became wrapped in heavy rain and would have been difficult to observe from a distance. The most extreme damage appeared to be in the northeast corner of the community.||Northwood, in southwest Grand Forks County, had a population of about 1000 people. 90 percent of the roughly 460 homes were damaged. One death occurred in a mobile home, with 18 other injuries reported. The death occurred in a trailer park on the north edge of town, where 19 total units were demolished.||Just to the east of the trailer park, in the area that sustained the extreme damage, three businesses were hit particularly hard. An agricultural company, the towns largest employer, had its buildings heavily damaged. A nearby construction company lost two large steel buildings and other equipment. Steel beams from the two steel buildings were twisted and tossed nearby. Finally, a car dealership lost 15 to 20 vehicles from its parking lot along highway 15. Many of these vehicles were damaged beyond recognition and tossed into nearby fields. One corn field to the north of highway 15 (across from the 3 businesses on the northeast side of town) had it stalks snapped off several inches from the root bases, with pieces of husked corn laying around.||Hangers and airplanes were also damaged at the airport. The local health center, school, supermarket, and grain elevator were damaged. Near the elevator, several rail cars were knocked off the tracks. Hundreds of trees were snapped, uprooted, or damaged. Power was also knocked out to many customers, but eventually was turned off (for safety reasons) to the entire town. A total of about 2600 truckloads of debris were hauled to the town landfill. In the days following the tornado, a Presidential Disaster Declaration was granted.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado was rated an EF1 on the new enhanced Fujita scale (86-109 mph).  The maximum width of the tornado was about 150 yards and the track length was about 5.5 miles. The tornado began around 1010 am CDT and lasted for about fifteen minutes.|The storm probably started as a waterspout over the Bay. Damage first began along the water just northeast of Pensacola Naval Air Station (just south of Silvershore drive).  Minor damage occurred in this area.  The storm tracked northeast over the water just parallel to the shore and moved ashore near the old Bayou Chico drawbridge.  Several homes in this area suffered roof damage.  Several boats were flipped over in this area as there are several boat storage facilities located near the water.|The tornado moved northeast and crossed Garden street near E street. Minor tree and power line damage occurred along this track. The tornado started causing a little more damage near Gregory and D streets as this is a more populated area.  The tornado continued tracking northeast and crossed Cervantes near A street and continued northeast and crossed Highway 29 near Mallory street.  Most of the home and church damage occurred along the track from B to Barcelona streets.  A couple of homes near Jackson street were heavily damaged and a church on A street had part of its roof taken off.  Four minor injuries also happened in this area.  A daycare center in the church had been alerted to a tornado and had taken cover several minutes before the tornado hit.|After crossing Highway 29 the storm crossed I-110 just north of the pool and started tracking a little more to the north northeast and crossed Davis near the ball fields.  Mostly tree and power line damage occurred along this track.  The ball fields had bleachers turned over and power lines down.|The storm continued to the north northeast and crossed Ninth avenue near Texar drive and crossed Bayou boulevard near the Target store and eventually dissipated near Cordova mall.  Most of the damage from the ball fields to Target was tree damage and minor roof damage.  Thirty cars in the Target parking lot were totally destroyed.  Very little damage occurred to the store.  Across the street, Office Depot suffered roof damage.  Part of the mall had skylights damaged and this allowed water to fall into part of the mall.  No damage was found north of the mall.|The storm destroyed four structures...caused major damage to twenty-four structures and caused minor damage to fifty eight structures.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It curved north then northwest before making a complete loop northwest of Greensburg.  Thus, the path was 25.8 miles.||This tornado destroyed nearly 95 percent of the town of Greensburg and despite adequate warning, unfortunately took the life of 11 people, some that were in basements.  First responders arriving on the scene requested three refrigerated refer trucks thinking there would be hundreds of fatalities. It also destroyed a dozen homes and a church south of Greensburg but did not cause injury.  In all, 961 homes and businesses were destroyed, 216 received major damage and 307 received minor damage. ||As the tornado was dissipating it turned northwest, west, south and then back east making a loop.  This was documented on both high resolution doppler radar and through the ground survey.  Also as the tornado was dissipating a new circulation quickly grew northeast of town.||Several oil storage tanks were destroyed causing an environmental concern.  In the town of Greensburg, hazardous material was strewn everywhere.  As of July 26th, the debris was still not fully cleaned up.  Two landfills were filled with debris from the town and this was even as most was burned.  Hundreds of thousands of dump truck loads were taken out.  It was estimated that approximately 400,000 cubic yards of debris was removed.  The major highway running through town was closed for 1 full month.||At one time there were over 150 law enforcement officers (from all over the country) present.  Military was called in for debris removal and rebuilding. ||Damage of insured losses exceeded $150 million, but including un-insured losses, was roughly 250 million dollars.||**** NOTE **** The 11th victim passed away on September 19th, 2007 after a long battle with a head injury sustained during the tornado.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Due to the number of sprinklers involved and the lack of replacements, some farmers would be out of service for over 1 year.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This killer tornado started in Comanche county and crossed into Kiowa county at 2003 CST / 2103 CDT.  It curved north then northwest before making a complete loop northwest of Greensburg.  Thus, the path was 25.8 miles.||This tornado destroyed nearly 95 percent of the town of Greensburg and despite adequate warning, unfortunately took the life of 11 people, some that were in basements.  First responders arriving on the scene requested three refrigerated refer trucks thinking there would be hundreds of fatalities. It also destroyed a dozen homes and a church south of Greensburg but did not cause injury.  In all, 961 homes and businesses were destroyed, 216 received major damage and 307 received minor damage. ||As the tornado was dissipating it turned northwest, west, south and then back east making a loop.  This was documented on both high resolution doppler radar and through the ground survey.  Also as the tornado was dissipating a new circulation quickly grew northeast of town.||Several oil storage tanks were destroyed causing an environmental concern.  In the town of Greensburg, hazardous material was strewn everywhere.  As of July 26th, the debris was still not fully cleaned up.  Two landfills were filled with debris from the town and this was even as most was burned.  Hundreds of thousands of dump truck loads were taken out.  It was estimated that approximately 400,000 cubic yards of debris was removed.  The major highway running through town was closed for 1 full month.||At one time there were over 150 law enforcement officers (from all over the country) present.  Military was called in for debris removal and rebuilding. ||Damage of insured losses exceeded $150 million, but including un-insured losses, was roughly 250 million dollars.||**** NOTE **** The 11th victim passed away on September 19th, 2007 after a long battle with a head injury sustained during the tornado.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
