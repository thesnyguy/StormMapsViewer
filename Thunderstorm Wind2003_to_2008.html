This was along a prefrontal surface boundary, and well out ahead of a strong cold front.  The atmosphere warmed into the 80s with surface dew points in the 70 to 75 degree range.  Additional thunderstorms formed into a broken west to east line across West Virginia, ahead of the squall line.  This caused flooding problems.  After 1500E, the squall line accelerated eastward, moving near 50 mph.  As a result of this event, a few more counties, such as Ritchie and Harrison, were added to FEMA's disaster declaration number 1474.   This federal disaster was initiated during the month of June.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Straight line winds caused localize damage along Avery Street in Parkersburg.  One frame house collapsed and several outbuilding were damaged.  The 3 residents in the collapsed house were injured slightly.  The 11 month son was rescued from under the debris.  One resident on Avery Street described the storm by saying, "It was like a chain saw, just going through the top of the trees with a vacuum.

A woman and her child were driving along Back Valley Road, just south of Georgia Highway 136 near Gass, when a tree broke off some 10 to 15 feet above the ground and fell on their minivan.  The child was trapped in the vehicle and had to be rescued. Both received injuries from the incident.  A third person was trapped in his vehicle at a MAPCO gasoline service station in Trenton when the awning from the station was ripped loose from the building, pinning the man in his vehicle.  Although the man had to be rescued from his vehicle, he did not suffer any injuries.  Along Georgia Highway 136 near Gass, west of Trenton, a fruit and vegetable stand suffered extensive damage.  The facade of the main building of the business was destroyed. A secondary building, including its contents, was completely destroyed, and a carport structure, that was also part of the facility, was thrown across the highway by thunderstorm winds.  Next door at a service station, one of the gasoline pumps was damaged,  two windows were broken, and some of the goods inside were knocked over and damaged or destroyed.  Behind the service station, a lumber and salvage yard also suffered damage from the thunderstorm winds.  Metal was blown through the front door and some materials stacked up outside were either damaged or blown away.  Although there were reports of funnel clouds and tornadoes in the area, the Dade Emergency Manager detected no rotation in the damage area and concluded that the damage was caused by a microburst, not a tornado.  He indicated that the damage area was one-half to one mile long and all mostly within a 100 yard wide area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In the town of Dixon, strong winds blew roofs off homes that hit and damaged the Old Dixon Store. As the storms moved through Lake County, wind damage was reported from Ronan to the southern end of Flathead Lake. Strong winds at the Ronan Airport caused the ropes to break off a Cessna 150, which careened into a Cessna 172, damaging both airplanes. Trees were reported uprooted near Finley Point and Polson, leaving at least two houses damaged from fallen trees. Strong wind gusts tore off part of the face of the Old Mill Place along Main Street in Polson, damaging a vehicle. 10 miles west of Polson, a small barn was blown over in Irvine Flats. Before the storms weakened in Flathead County, a twelve inchdiameter tree was blown over near Big Fork, damaging a home owners fence.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Lifted indices were in the -10 to -15 C. range as the low level jet began to strengthen during the nighttime hours.  A cold front to the northwest of the state began to sink southeast into Iowa as weak low pressure moved northeast along the front.  An MCS formed near the triple point of the low and the cold front, then tracked east across northern Iowa during the early morning hours.  Scattered thunderstorms formed south of the MCS, however most of them did not produce severe weather.  As the system evolved it took on a bow echo configuration as it raced across the state.  Numerous locations reported winds of 55 to 70 MPH along the path of the storm.  Trees were blown down in many locations.  There were no reports of widespread significant damage however.  The storms moved east of the state by sunrise.  One brief tornado touchdown was reported in a field just east of Mason City.  The tornado only touched the ground before lifting and caused no damage.  One person was injured as the storms moved through the area.  High winds toppled trees in the Clear Lake area.  One of the trees fell on a woman in a tent, pinning here and causing minor injuries.  She was taken to the hospital and received 11 stitches for a head injury.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A rain-wrapped tornado was sighted in western Valley county shortly after 7:30 pm by several storm chasers.  The tornado blasted 2 farmsteads, one of which was abandoned.  A total of 14 outbuildings were damaged or destroyed.  The tornado was in the far western part of Valley county along the Comstock road.  Another brief tornado was reported near Arcadia a short time later but no damage was confirmed.Elsewhere, vicious high winds over 70 mph did extensive damage north of Shelby in eastern Polk county.  Several farmsteads sustained house, outbuilding, grain bin and tree damage.  In one case, a garage was nearly ripped from the house it was attached to.  Twenty four center pivot irrigation systems were severely damaged or destroyed.  A semi-tractor trailer was overturned as the high winds approached.  The driver was unhurt but a passenger sustained minor injuries and was treated at a nearby hospital.  At one point, 4,500 customers were without power in the area.  The high winds also pounded the Palmer area about an hour earlier that night.  On a farm north of Palmer, a roof was torn from a metal building, a garage destroyed and a large goose neck trailer tossed several feet by the wind.  The damage was strewn across a nearby corn field.Finally, hail caused crop and property damage in parts of the area.  The St. Libory area sustained the worst damage with hail stones the size of baseballs and larger were reported.  Siding and windows were heavily damaged on many homes, especially just north of town.  Crop damage was fairly extensive along a narrow path in the same area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Nearly 18,000 customers in D.C. lost power as a direct result of the storm.  The 76 MPH wind gust was recorded at Johnson Junior High School and a wind gust of 63 MPH was recorded at Charles Hart Middle School. An apartment complex on Morris Road SE sustained significant roof and window damage.  Two people were injured and 25 people were displaced by the debris. A downed power line nearby caught three cars on fire.  On Alabama Avenue SE, trees were felled onto houses.  On Suitland Parkway and Staunton Road SE, a tree fell on a deck and trees blocked the road. At Seventh Street and Raleigh Place SE, a tree was felled onto a 2-story home and an elderly couple was trapped inside. On Jay Street NE, an apartment building roof and windows were damaged and several trees were downed.  A 2 month old baby and a woman were injured. A total of 46 families were displaced by the damage. Very heavy downpours also caused Rhode Island Avenue to be closed by high water.  In addition, power outages caused three pumping stations to shut down, leading to basement flooding in Northeast.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Winds up to 76 MPH damaged several buildings, and downed numerous trees and power lines.

This was along a prefrontal surface boundary, and well out ahead of a strong cold front.  The atmosphere warmed into the 80s with surface dew points in the 70 to 75 degree range.  Additional thunderstorms formed into a broken west to east line across West Virginia, ahead of the squall line.  This caused flooding problems.  After 1500E, the squall line accelerated eastward, moving near 50 mph.

CAPE values were close to 4000 J/kg, though the airmass was quite capped with 700 mb temperatures around +12 C.  A cold front was weakening as it approached from the north.  The front itself did not make it into Iowa until the morning of the 26th, however thunderstorms that fired along the front the previous night formed an outflow boundary across Iowa by the morning of the 25th.  By the evening of the 25th, the boundary had lifted north into the central part of the state  Thunderstorms fired along the boundary and also formed into an area of relative weakening of the cap over southeast Iowa.  There were several reported microburst events during the night.  One of the most destructive was over Story County, in Story City, where several hundred trees were toppled by the high winds.  Damage was reported to 47 homes in and around the city as well.  Most of the damage was minor.  Three businesses were also affected.   Power was knocked out in some places for up to 36 hours.  Between 3:30-3:45 a.m. on August 26, 2003, a swath of downburst winds struck Story City, Iowa and nearby farms.  A National Weather Service damage survey indicated that the path of wind damage was about one mile wide, with the strongest winds probably occurring within Story City.  The path of continuous tree damage was about 10 miles long, starting about 5 miles west of Story City near the Story/Boone county line.  The damage path was mainly north of highway E18, and then east of Story City it followed highway E15 for about 3 miles.  There was one injury as a semi-tractortrailer truck was overturned.  The driver was pinned and ended up taken to the hospital.  Three poultry confinement buildings and a grain bin were destroyed in the Story City area.   Elsewhere, high winds overturned a semi-tractortrailer truck in Davis County.  There were numerous reports of trees and power lines down from northwest, into central, and southeast Iowa.  A few reports of hail were received, but the largest hail was only an inch and one quarter in diameter.  That fell northeast of St. Anthony in Marshall County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 37K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Citrus County Emergency Management conducted a survey and found the damage was caused by straight line winds.  Seven mobile homes were destroyed, seven homes had major damage, and 33 homes had minor damage.  Most of the minor damage included damage to pool cages, car ports, and skirting around mobile homes. Two injuries were reported on the 8500 block of West Moonhaze Court. One man suffered minor back injury as the wall of his mobile home fell on him as he slept.  One women suffered an eye injury from debris as her mobile home lost its roof.  Numerous trees were downed or damaged along the path of the storm.

The frontal system that had moved through the state on the night of the 22nd was returning north as a warm front.  This time Iowa did not get completely into the warm sector.  The surface front was dragged north into Iowa by low pressure that moved out of Kansas northeast into central Iowa by the mid to late evening.  The airmass was pushed southeast out of the state by a cold front that passed through the state during the evening and early morning hours.  The airmass in the warm sector became very unstable.  Lifted indices were around -13 C with CAPE values greater than 5000 J/kg by the late afternoon.  The air advected north into Iowa during the day and into the evening.  Thunderstorms erupted in two places.  The first to affect the DSM CWA was the development of several elevated supercells over west central into southwest Iowa.  The storms continued to lift east and northeast across the area.  A few tornadoes touched down, however with the very elevated nature of the storms it was very difficult for the tornadoes to reach the ground.  By the late afternoon, a solid squall line developed along the cold front.  The line took on a Line Echo Wave Pattern by evening.  Several segments of the line bowed out, resulting in high winds.  At times the winds reached 80 MPH.  One of the thunderstorms produced high winds in the Early area of Sac County.  They overturned a semi-tractortrailer truck, causing $80,000 damage and causing minor injuries to the driver.  Tornadoes that formed along this line actually formed where the Rear Flank Downdraft cut through the line.  A clear meso was formed and the small tornadoes advanced around the meso and were in front of the thunderstorm line.  Touchdowns were all brief.  Hail was common with the stronger storm, with much of it in the one to one and three-quarter inch in diameter.  Given the antecedent soil conditions in Iowa, flash flooding became a major issue.  Numerous counties reported flash flooding as rainfall of one to 4 inches in spots resulted in flooded highways.  The thunderstorms formed into an MCC by the early evening hours.  As they moved out of the state, they delivered one more punch to the state.  High winds developed in the wake of the complex.  Several counties of north central, northeast, and central Iowa received high winds.  Damage occurred in several locations to both trees and out buildings.

All three men pinned in the rubble were injured. One man required air med-evac to Wesley Medical Center in Wichita where, upon arrival, he was listed in critical condition. (By Friday Night, his condition had been upgraded to "fair".) A 2nd required ambulance transport to Via Christi Regional Medical Center in Wichita where he was listed in fair condition. The 3rd man did not seek medical attention. In addition, the following sustained significant damage: 12 homes, 4 businesses (including the Elko Building on west side of town that lost a 20 by 30 foot section of roofing on the west side of the structure causing the west wall to buckle inward), one shop, a camper that was blown over and rolled nearly 100 feet, and the roof of a carport that was dislodged and blown over the roof of the mobile home to which it had been attached. Obviously, damage to trees, power lines, and power poles was extensive. The latter two severed power to Harper for approximately 5 hours.

A few intense microbursts with winds over 70 MPH were embedded within the line. The brunt of the damage was in a swath extending from southwest of Mount Vernon (including Perry County) across Franklin and Saline Counties to Gallatin and White Counties. The first intense microburst was about 5 miles east of Sesser in Franklin County, where three camper trailers were damaged at Wayne Fitzgerrell State Park and a dozen trees were blown down. One of the campers was overturned onto its top. Two persons in campers received broken bones, but the injuries were not life-threatening. The dimensions of this microburst, with peak winds of 75 MPH, were about 200 by 300 yards. A larger and more intense downburst occurred in Gallatin County at New Haven. Estimated winds to 105 MPH downed numerous trees, including at least 10 that fell on houses. A couple of trailers were reportedly overturned. The dimensions of the damage area were about 4 to 5 miles long and 200 yards wide. Across Franklin, northern Williamson, Saline, Gallatin, and White Counties, trees were down across primary roads. In Williamson County, trees were blocking Interstate 57 around mile marker 60, and Route 37 was blocked at the Franklin County line. Other fallen trees resulted in vehicle accidents with injuries. About 2 miles north of Harrisburg in Saline County, two vehicles collided with a fallen tree that was blocking Route 34. In White County, one fatality occurred when a vehicle ran into a fallen tree (indirect storm fatality). A total of six persons were involved in this fatal accident on Route 1 near Norris City. A tree fell on one car, and then a second car collided with the tree. Some of the six people were injured and trapped in their vehicles. Near the Gallatin/White County line, trees blocked Route 141 leading to the Wabash River bridge. Across southern Illinois, most damage to  structures was caused by falling trees,  however three barns were damaged directly by wind north and east of Tamaroa in Perry County. Pieces were blown 200 yards from the barn. Multiple trees were blown down across Jefferson, Franklin, Jackson, northern Williamson, northern Saline, White, and Gallatin Counties, as well as north of Pinckneyville in Perry County. A number of trees landed on vehicles and houses. In Benton (in Franklin County), an 85-foot oak tree landed across a house and four vehicles, extensively damaging or destroying the vehicles. Separate from the widespread wind damage, a supercell thunderstorm developed in Edwards County, then moved east across Wabash County and the Wabash River. This storm produced hail the size of quarters in Mount Carmel and golf balls at Allendale. In Edwards County, numerous trees and power lines were blown down, from west of Albion into the city of Albion. Across most of Wabash County, numerous trees were blown down, causing many power outages.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 70K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The event transitioned from small hail events and individual thunderstorm downbursts producing minor damage to a large scale high-wind event sweeping rapidly east away from the parent thunderstorms.  Widespread winds of 60 to 70 mph occurred with swaths of stronger winds reaching over 90 mph.  Tree damage was extensive over a 10 county area with some trees 18 to 24 inches in diameter being snapped off above ground.  Numerous reports were received of small buildings and sheds destroyed along with widespread roof damage.  Power poles were also either pushed over or broken, resulting in areas of power outage for 1-2 hours.  A huge cloud of dirt was raised as the strong outflow raced eastward, likely enhanced by several years of dry soils. Visibility was instantly reduced to near zero with law enforcement and rescue personnel stating it was difficult to see beyond the vehicle hood when driving.  Two fatalities were reported on Interstate-70, including the death of a Kansas state senator, whose vehicle was struck from behind by a semi-trailer as he slowed down in reduced visibility.  Other vehicular accidents also occurred on county highways resulting in minor property damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Widespread tree damage in town with 6-8 inch diameter branches down.

The event transitioned from small hail events and individual thunderstorm downbursts producing minor damage to a large scale high-wind event sweeping rapidly east away from the parent thunderstorms.  Widespread winds of 60 to 70 mph occurred with swaths of stronger winds reaching over 90 mph.  Tree damage was extensive over a 10 county area with some trees 18 to 24 inches in diameter being snapped off above ground.  Numerous reports were received of small buildings and sheds destroyed along with widespread roof damage.  Power poles were also either pushed over or broken, resulting in areas of power outage for 1-2 hours.  A huge cloud of dirt was raised as the strong outflow raced eastward, likely enhanced by several years of dry soils. Visibility was instantly reduced to near zero with law enforcement and rescue personnel stating it was difficult to see beyond the vehicle hood when driving.  Two fatalities were reported on Interstate-70, including the death of a Kansas state senator, whose vehicle was struck from behind by a semi-trailer as he slowed down in reduced visibility.  Other vehicular accidents also occurred on county highways resulting in minor property damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Small building destroyed and boy was struck in the head by flying 2x4 board.

A complex weather situation was in place due to the convection from the previous night.  An outflow boundary extended east to west across northern Missouri.  The synoptic frontal boundary extended from central Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The air was clear over Iowa during the day, allowing for temperatures to recover.  Dew point values also recovered quite rapidly with readings in the upper 60s to low 70s by the late afternoon hours.  Lifted indices dropped into the -5 to -10 C. range by evening with CAPE values approaching 5000 J/kg.  By the evening hours, the frontal boundary and outflow boundary had converged and were located along Interstate 80.  Explosive thunderstorm development took place during the very late afternoon and evening hours in spite of the weak shear profile.  Discrete supercells formed in a narrow line along Interstate 80 from near Des Moines on west.  The storms became tornadic quickly.  To add insult to injury, a strong thunderstorm complex formed over Nebraska and moved east along the line of convection over Iowa.  As the event took shape, all modes of severe weather occurred.  The storms developed so rapidly that there was little more than a half hour from the first hail and wind report to the first tornado touchdown.  Hail and high wind reports were too numerous to mention individually here.  Numerous reports of golf ball size hail were received.  Boone and Story Counties reported some of the largest hail with the event as baseball size hail pelted the are.  There was one report of very large hail northwest of Slater in Story County.  Hail five and one half inches in diameter punched 8 holes through a steel roof.  There was severe house siding and roof damage in the area.  There were numerous tornadoes, especially in the central Iowa Iowa.  At one point there were several supercells around the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Two of the stronger tornadoes touched down west and south of Des Moines.  Fortunately, most of the tornado tracks were over open areas and resulted in little damage.  High winds became a problem, especially after sunset, as the complex from Nebraska moved in.  The system became more of a derecho during the late night hours.  Eighty plus MPH winds pelted southwest Iowa and downed barns and several buildings in Adams and Cass Counties.  A beta bow element formed in central Iowa shortly before midnight.  The bow echo produced a measured wind gust of 106 MPH in northern Warren County.  The high winds continued to push east along Interstate 80 for the next hour or so before it started to weaken.  The other major problem was with heavy rain.  The convection from the previous night set the stage by saturating soils.  The echos trained for several hours across central Iowa with very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall rates of 4 to 5 inches per hour were common under the heavier cells.  Several locations received 2 to 5 inch rainfalls in under  two hours, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  Reports of major highways being inundated by water were common.  By the end of the night, a swath of 4 to 9 inch rainfall was evident north of Interstate 80.  Longer term river flooding became a major problem by the morning of the 23rd.  There were two lightning related injuries.  Two people were injured when they were struck by lightning out of doors in Nevada.  The lightning struck close by as they were carrying groceries into their home.  The jolt caused them to fall, resulting in laceration to the head.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first tornado touched down  about 1.5 miles north of Taylor (Jackson County) around 6:22 p.m.  It caused intermittent damage during the first two miles of its path as it moved east southeastward across Highway 95.  It then strengthened and stayed on the ground for another 3 miles.  Many trees were knocked down, and it also demolished a garage and took the roof off two other structures. The tornado reached F1 strength (estimated 75-85 mph winds) briefly as it moved through the Davis and Taylor Road areas where it demolished a garage approximately 2 miles northeast of Taylor. This tornado appeared to lift approximately 4 miles east of Taylor around 6:28 p.m. About 3 tenths of a mile to the south of where the first tornado lifted, a second tornado formed. This tornado primarily caused tree damage. Shortly after formation, it reached F1 strength (estimated 80-100 mph winds), clearing out a path about 30 yards wide through a wooded area just north of West Pine Creek Road. This tornado weakened about 5 miles east of Taylor, but caused sporadic F0 damage until it finally lifted around 6:32 p.m. about 8 miles east of Taylor in the East Pine Creek Road area.  Total path length of these two tornadoes was nearly 9 miles. They were on the ground for about 10 minutes. A third tornado quickly developed about 3 miles west of Warrens (Monroe County) near Arctic Road, just west of Interstate 94 around 7:00 p.m.  It hit a home along Interstate 94, then crossed the Interstate hitting a semi-truck, before moving into Jellystone Campground just west of Warrens.  The tornado and associated strong winds around the storm knocked down hundreds of trees in this area, and damaged several tents, buildings, campers, and cars in Jellystone Campground.  One gentleman was seriously injured when a tree fell on him during a rescue attempt.  He was in a coma for a period of time, but survived with lasting disabilities.  The tornado continued just southwest of Warrens and hit a home, blowing the roof off, south of the village along County Road O.  It lifted about 2 miles southeast of Warrens around 7:12 p.m.  The tornado path was approximately 4.5 miles in total length, with a maximum width of 50 yards. The tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Damage Scale. Wind speeds were likely 90 to 112 mph, with most of the damage related to downburst winds around the actual tornado.  At least 3 people were hospitalized briefly for injuries, but there no fatalities. The fourth tornado formed in extreme eastern Juneau County, about 2 miles west of Castle Rock Dam. The tornado moved east-northeast across Castle Rock Lake and into western Adams County.  It tracked near or along Edgewood Ave, with extensive tree damage to the Quincy Bluff area, including the lookout ranger tower there. Hundreds of trees were blown down from strong winds rotating around the tornadic thunderstorm, which were in excess of 90 mph at times.  The tornado intermittently tracked east to areas just north of Edgewood Drive crossing Highway 13 approximately 5 miles south of Adams/Friendship (Adams County).  Downburst winds on the south side of the storm demolished at least 8 mobile homes in Edgewood Estates that were orientated north-south and took the full brunt of the cross wind.  This was the same area hit by severe weather in September 2000.  Most of the Town of Easton (Adams County) had extensive damage with hundreds of trees down.  It continued to move east-southeast before lifting shortly before the Adams-Marquette County line about 3 miles southeast of Grand Marsh around 7:55 pm.  A broad area of straight line wind damage was found south of this tornado track with widespread tree damage occurring up to 1 mile south of the track.  The tornado path was approximately 17 to 18 miles in length. The tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Damage Scale with estimated wind speeds in the 73 to 112 mph range.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 60K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The monthly rainfall ranged from a low of4.08 inches in Eastland County to 20.02 inches at Hudson Oaks in Parker County.  Many locations had twice their normal rainfall for the month.  The DFW Airport had the second wettest June on Record, and had measurable rain 18 days, the most days in any month with measurable rain.  These heavy rains produced periodic flash flooding somewhere in North Central Texas nearly every day of the month.  The month began with a northwest flow event on the 1st, with a large hp supercell producing large hail from Jack County southeast to Parker County.  The storm had an erratic southeast movement, but when the storm entered Northern Parker County, it made a left turn and moved nearly due east through Tarrant County, producing countywide wind damage, with measured winds up to 86 miles an hour at the Meacham Airport, some large hail, and flash flood producing rains.   This became the most destructive storm in Tarrant County since the Mayfest Storm on May 5, 1995.  TXU Electric had their worst power outages in the Companies history, as over 500,000 people were without electricity, some for as long as 5 days.  They had to bring in work crews from out of state to help restore power.    Damage estimates for Tarrant County were well over $100,000,000 from this storm.  Sporadic severe weather occurred the rest of the month, but heavy rain and flooding were the main problems.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A mobile home was destroyed by high winds, and two residents inside were seriously injured.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A line of thunderstorms tore the roof from a barn, downed numerous trees and power lines and blew a pickup truck into a ditch as the storms moved through the Wood county communities of Vesper, Nekoosa, and Wisconsin Rapids. Glass fragments caused a minor injury to one of the occupants of the pickup truck.  The storms also produced 7 minutes of dime size hail 1 mile east of Wisconsin Rapids.  The storms also damaged several buildings 4 miles west of Stevens Point (Portage co.), downed trees in Saxeville (Waushara co.) and dropped quarter size hail in Plover (Portage co.).As the storms moved through Portage county three tornadoes touched down.  One of the tornadoes caused minor tree damage in an industrial park in Whiting.  Eyewitnesses observed water being sucked out of a pond at the same time as doors to an office were sucked open.  Another tornado downed several trees, knocked down a fence, damaged the roof of a house and damaged some outbuildings as it passed north of Almond.  The third tornado was the strongest and was on the ground intermittently for 10 miles from southeast Portage county into southwest Waupaca county.  It downed trees and overturned an irrigation system in Portage county.  It strengthened in Waupaca county where it scoured asphalt off a road, destroyed a barn, sheared off the top 50 feet of a silo, crushing three calves, damaged a sheet metal outbuilding and killed 3 sheep.  It tore the roof from a house and destroyed the garage, overturned a semi trailer and moved it 50 feet, blew hay wagons against trees and snapped off or uprooted numerous trees.  Some of the debris from this tornado landed several miles east in the Fremont area (Waupaca co.).A tornado touched down in at least four locations from Little Chute to Kaukauna as the storms moved across Outagamie county.  It toppled or twisted large trees, ripped parts of the roofs from residential and commercial buildings, destroyed storage sheds and an old barn and overturned semi trailers and dropped some of them on other vehicles.A brief tornado touchdown also occurred on the west side of Green Bay (Brown co.) where it caused some tree damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Flooding first developed across the southwest mountains, when several small streams and creeks overflowed their banks, including Toot Hollow Creek near Bryson City. Several rescues were required during the evening in Macon County, as creeks and streams began to threaten homes. Overnight, flooding became more widespread, with Macon County enduring the worst of it. The Little Tennessee River overflowed its banks during the early morning of the 17th, and continued to flood through much of the day. The river flooded an industrial park in Macon County, causing extensive damage. In Swain County, 500,000 gallons of raw sewage and numerous natural gas tanks were swept down the river. Hundreds of structures were damaged or destroyed, and several private bridges were swept away. Portions of highways 105, 64, and 28 were all closed in Macon County, some due to major damage that was estimated to take several months to repair. In addition, a trout farm lost 60,000 pounds of fish.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A mobile home at the base of Fishhawk Mountain was destroyed in the Peeks Creek community. The home's resident was injured when debris from the collapsing home fell on him.

The most significant wind damage occurred from Bentonia to around Little Yazoo. Here the winds were estimated around 90 mph. Many structures sustained major to minor damage with all or a portion of the roof blown off, siding peeled off and windows broken. The Bentonia-Gibbs School had a good portion of its roof blown off and sustained water damage. Additionally, three businesses had major damage, three with minor, six mobile homes were destroyed and nine sustained major damage, twenty-seven homes sustained minor damage and seven sheds were destroyed.

Damage continued eastward along County Road 13 for approximately 4 miles. Extensive tree damage was observed along this entire area. No evidence of rotation was observed. Additionally...more concentrated damage was discovered to two mobile homes and one old pillar and beam constructed home near Cherry Street. Both of the mobile homes were completely destroyed with debris scattered up to one hundred yards downwind. Four injuriesoccurred in these homes, two middle aged females, a 2 year old girl and a 5 year old boy. Injuries were mostly cuts and bruises, although the five year old sustained several broken bones. A witness reported that the 5 year old was blown a considerable distance from the mobile home. The tin roof of the traditional home was completely removed.

A large area of high pressure aloft was located over the west half of the country, placing Iowa in a large scale northwest flow pattern.  A weak cold front dropped southeast through the Dakotas and approached northwest Iowa.  At the same time, a series of MCS's developed over the Rockies, and rode around the upper level ridge of high pressure.  During the day, the dew points across Iowa warmed into the mid 60s to mid 70s with surface temperatures in the mid to upper 80s.  The lifted index by evening was in the -5 C. range with CAPE values in the 2000 to 3000 J/kg range.  The provided a rich environment for an MCS that approached the state during the later part of the afternoon.  The MCS developed over eastern Wyoming and southwest South Dakota earlier in the day.  As it overtopped the upper ridge, it turned southeast into Iowa.  As it did, the storms took on more of a bow echo appearance and the cluster became a small Derecho.  Early on in the event a tornado touched down briefly in Emmet County north of Gruver.  It was in open fields and caused little damage.  The main mode of severe weather was in the form of high winds.  There were  few hail reports, however with the freezing level above 16,500 feet, hail was limited.  The winds caused widespread damage from Emmet County, east to Winnebago County, then south into the central part of the state about as far south as Interstate 80.  South of this area no damage was reported as the storms weakened rapidly.  Two semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned in Story County by the high wind about 2 miles west of Nevada.  There was one injury from this.  One of the drivers had to be rescued as he hung over the edge of a bridge.  He was taken to hospital, treated, and released.  There were numerous reports of tree and power line damage over the northwest, north central, and central counties of the state.  High winds blew windows out of a home at the ISU Agronomy Farm.  Structural damage was reported in Marshall County at State Center.  The roof of a large building with a roof of less than two years of age received damage.  A high school roof in Story County at Nevada had its roof partially peeled back as well.  In addition to these reports, there were scattered reports of outbuildings and sheds being flattened by the wind.  Visibility during the high winds was occasionally reduced to near zero in blowing dust by the time the storms reached central Iowa.  The gust front from the storms had moved well ahead of the storms themselves, some 10 to 15 miles ahead, with some of the areas receiving severe winds not receiving any rainfall at all.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Ten buildings sustained major roof or structural damage. One such casualty was the Travelodge, where the roof was peeled and twisted off part of the motel resulting in water damage to an unspecified number of upstairs guest rooms. In a few instances, the structures were completely unroofed. Numerous vehicles sustained broken windows. Twelve people suffered minor injuries, all of which required treatment at Central Kansas Medical Center. One such injury occurred when the driver of a 2003 Acura had parked his car in the Travelodge parking lot shortly before part of it's roof struck the vehicle. The car's roof and windshield were smashed, trapping him for approximately 15 minutes. Tree damage was extensive and occurred throughout the community, with many trees uprooted. Power lines and power poles downed in and around the city. Power was severed to approximately 5,500 residences. Of the estimated $5 million damage, $750,000 was inflicted upon equipment maintained by Midwest Energy, while an estimated $200,000 to $250,000 was inflicted upon electrical wires maintained by Aquila Electric.(Narrative courtesy of Great Bend Tribune and Hutchinson News.)<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Temperatures ranged from the mid 80s across south central Wisconsin to near record highs in the lower 90s across southeast Wisconsin.  There were primarily two areas that were affected by severe thunderstorms.  A broken line of severe storms from Marquette to Dane County tracked east northeast into Dodge, Fond du Lac, Washington, and Sheboygan  counties.  This line produced damaging wind gusts from between 50 to 62 knots (58 mph to 71 mph).  Tree and power line damage was reported across many areas affected by this line of storms.  Another area affected by severe storms stretched from Rock county through Walworth, Waukesha, Milwaukee, and Ozaukee counties as one large supercell developed and tracked northeast along I-43.  Several reports of damaging winds estimated in excess of 70 knots (80 mph) were collected from portions of Waukesha county.  Widespread tree and power line damage was noted from Mukwonago through Brookfield.  More sporatic tree and power line damage was reported across northern Milwaukee and southern Ozaukee counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Powerful thunderstorm winds toppled a tree, which fell onto a car, injuring one person.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In addition, the base of an upper level trough moved across south-central Texas Thursday afternoon.  This feature provided some large scale lift and ushered colder mid and upper level air across the region, which destabilized the atmosphere as surface temperatures rose into the upper 70s and low 80s.  The surface high pressure center to the northeast provided a moderate easterly flow near the surface which quickly turned southeast to south above the surface.  In addition, modest westerlies existed in the mid and upper levels of the atmosphere.  This vertical wind shear together with the modestly unstable atmosphere provided an environment favorable for rotating thunderstorms.  During the afternoon scattered thunderstorms began to develop in the warm, unstable airmass across the Rio Grande Plains and deep south Texas.  A few thunderstorms, which developed along the weak surface boundary, gained strength and became severe as they moved southeast along the boundary. The event began as a strong storm developed near Zavala/Frio Counties in the western hill country.  This storm quickly became severe as it crossed into La Salle County, gaining supercell characteristics as it traveled along the surface boundary across La Salle and southwest McMullen counties.  Reports of dime to penny size hail and 60 mph wind gusts were received by storm spotters just south of Dilley in northern La Salle County.  No storm reports were received in McMullen County, likely because of the lack of population and roadways through the area where the severe storm tracked. The storm tracked through southwestern McMullen and northern Duval Counties, maintaining its strength while exhibiting strong convergence in the middle portions of the storm (MARC signature) at times.  Another storm pulsed up across north-central Jim Wells County before weakening southeast of Alice. Outflow from this storm, as well as moderate to strong east to northeast flow across the Coastal Bend and southeast Rio Grande Plains, may have contributed to an enhanced area of wind shear across Duval County.  As the La Salle/McMullen supercell thunderstorm moved into this area across Duval County, the thunderstorm circulation steadily deepened and strengthened.  Doppler radar showed and a reflectivity notch developing right along the above mentioned boundary associated with the increased storm rotation. A Tornado Vortex Signature developed near this notch prompting a tornado warning.  Prior to the tornado warning, severe thunderstorm warnings were present through the life of this storm due to strong hail signatures and severe straight line wind indications seen on doppler radar. A NWS storm survey team toured Duval and Jim Wells counties and concluded the damage was largely a result of straight line winds from a long track supercell thunderstorm.  However, it cannot be ruled out that an isolated tornado was embedded in the storm. Wind speeds were estimated to range from 80 to 100 mph which is equivalent to an F1 tornado on the Fujita damage scale.  The damage swath, which was approximately 4 to 5 miles in width and over 40 miles in length, stretched from just east of Freer to near  Premont. Broken windows and roof shingle damage on all properties was observed on the northwest side, which indicated straight line wind damage and the wind blowing from the northwest to the southeast.  American Electric Power (AEP) crews on the scene reported that roughly 100 power poles were knocked down across Duval and Jim Well counties.  The NWS team assessed that all poles were blown in the downwind direction to the southeast. Visible damage began near Highway 44 and FM 3196, where roughly half a dozen power poles were split in half.  The damage continued in the community of Rosita in which houses experienced minor damage.  Hail was also reported up to 4 inches in depth.  Indications that flash flooding occurred on Rosita Creek was observed.The storm appeared to strengthen as it approached the northeast side of Benavides and the town of San Jose.  Two mobile homes were destroyed and tree limbs were broken with all damage lying in a southeast direction.  Fifteen homes were damaged in San Jose with window and roof damage on the northwest side, which again indicates the wind blew from the northwest to the southeast. Just southeast of San Jose, near the intersection of FM 2295 and FM 1329 and extending south all the way to Rios, tree limbs and power poles were broken and lying in a southeast direction.  An empty grain silo was also destroyed and a newly framed home was blown off its foundation. In extreme southwest Jim Wells county near the intersection of county road 428 and 716, a large empty grain silo was destroyed and lying in the middle of the roadway.  Power poles were knocked down, 5 homes were damaged, and 1 garage was completely destroyed.  Again all the visible damage was lying in a southeast direction. Eye witness reports indicate that nickel to quarter sized hail covered the ground up 4 to 6 inches deep along the entire storm track.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An NWS storm survey concluded straight line winds severely damaged roughly 15 homes, a community center and church.  Nearly all the damage was observed on the northwest sides of the structres with debris scattered to the southeast.  Two mobile home were completely destoyed, with one man injured that was inside one of the mobile homes.  The two mobile homes that were completly destroyed were oriented north-northeast to south-southwest, perpendicular to the northwest to southeast straight-line winds observed on radar.  The damage from the two mobile homes was thrown to the southeast roughly 20 yards.  In addition numerous large trees and power poles were uprooted and broken, all lying to the southeast direction.  Several vehicles were also damaged by the uprooted trees and debris from homes.  Winds were estimated between 80 and 100 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Though somewhat early in  the season for such a storm, the storm was a classic storm.  As it quite typical of April or  May, the storm was a classic "bowling ball" type system with a closed upper low lifting northeast out of the southwest U.S.  Surface low pressure moved from Kansas into Southwest Iowa during the event.  A dryline pushed northeast with the low into the state.  Strong moisture transport took place ahead of the storm with dew points reaching the mid 50s to low 60s over Iowa as afternoon temperatures were in the 60 to 70 degree range.  Strong south winds in the low levels were in place with speeds in the 35 to 45 kt range.  The atmosphere destabilized during the afternoon with lifted indices reaching -7 by the early afternoon.  CAPE values were not all that great, at about 1000 J/kg.  The freezing level during the storms was relatively low, at about 10,700 feet.  Thunderstorms developed in western Iowa and lifted northeast at 50 to 55 MPH during the afternoon.  These formed in the warm sector.  At the same time, the dryline pushed into western Iowa during the late afternoon.  The storms from the dryline produced hail and strong winds, along with 2 small tornadoes.  The line of storms took on a bow echo appearance as they raced across the state.  The storms that formed ahead of the dryline were not as significant and produced only marginal severe weather.  As the dryline storms moved in, reports of hail and high wind were numerous.  Two small tornadoes touched down briefly, causing little damage.  One was west of the Creston Airport in Union County, the second was near De Soto in Dallas County.  Minor damage occurred with the tornado west of Creston as it damaged breeze way and carport there.  High winds were quite wide spread with wind speeds reaching or exceeding 80 MPH at times.  In Latimer winds of 80 MPH took the roof off of a building for example.  In Franklin County,  high winds lifted bleachers and threw them 300 feet, across a road.  Damage was reported to an apartment building roof in Crawford County and a dugout destroyed as well.  Several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being overturned were received.  One was overturned in Crawford County on the Shelby County line, 6 were overturned in Adair County by 71 MPH winds with one person receiving minor injuries.  Six trucks were blown off the highway in Guthrie County and another in Story County.  Two people were injured in Boone County when high winds blew a tree onto a mobile home.  The mobile home was totally destroyed.  Three mobile homes were flipped in Story County by the high winds.  Reports of damage to outbuildings were too numerous to mention here.  Hail reports were quite numerous.  Much of the hail was around an inch in diameter. One of the storms produced large hail in the Des Moines Metro area.  Two inch diameter hail fell in Des Moines, with golf ball size hail in Norwalk and one and one half inch diameter hail falling at the Des Moines Airport.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A trailer park also sustained damage. Numerous telephone poles and trees were blown down. Many trees and cars on the Kansas University campus were damaged. More than 70 of Kansas University's 116 buildings received some damage. Many homes in the city also sustained damage. Video of the event indicated a microburst with winds of 70 to 90 mph. Several notable events reflected the severity of the wind damage. A heating/cooling unit was blown from the roof of a campus residence hall and landed on a car. Several semi-trucks were blown onto their sides. Two brick spires were toppled from one of the city's oldest churches dating back to 1870. Two 60 foot tall silos at a country market near Lawrence were destroyed. Three 500 pound ventilators atop a junior high building were blown off the roof...one landing nearly 100 yards away. Each ventilator was 6 feet tall and 5 feet wide. The emergency manager of Douglas county estimated total damage at 8 million dollars of which 6 million dollars occurred on the Kansas University campus alone.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The time frame was late on a Friday afternoon and into the early evening.The initial severe weather was large hail.  However, the storms following the initial cells, consolidated and organized into a squall line.  On its leading edge, severe wind gust moved out of Pike County Kentucky and through Mingo County around 1630E.  Trees fell and damaged a few homes.  Several commercial and residential buildings in Williamson sustained damage from the wind alone.  A large portion of the damage was to awnings, porches, siding, and roofs.

In Dexter, considerable damage occurred. Numerous trees were blown down, and many roofs were damaged. The city received nearly 150 calls concerning downed trees. Trees fell on at least three cars and two trucks. Just in the three Dexter city parks, about a dozen trees were down. Power was out in parts of Dexter for up to two days. Part of the roof of a convenience store was blown off, and a storage shed was destroyed. Two vehicles at the convenience store were damaged by the roof. Dexter city hall sustained minor damage. An amateur radio antenna was bent 90 degrees. In Essex, which is between Dexter and Circle City, several homes and businesses had sections of shingles blown off. Some trees were snapped or uprooted. About 250,000 dollars damage occurred to agricultural equipment and machinery at two agribusinesses near Essex.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 400K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The thunderstorms initially downed trees and wires in western and central Massachusetts, from Amherst and West Springfield to Hardwick, Sterling, Northborough, and Southborough. A nine year old child was injured in Northborough and there was some structural damage to a shopping center on Route 9. There were also reports of large hail including penny sized hail in Sterling and Northborough, quarter sized hail in Webster, and quarter to half dollar sized hail in West Boylston.Lightning also caused considerable damage in central Massachusetts. A large tree was struck by lightning in Spencer which traveled into a nearby house, igniting a fire that left the home uninhabitable. Lightning also struck the radio tower of the Massachusetts State Police barracks in Charlton, severely damaging the radio communication system. No injuries were reported in either case.As the thunderstorms reached eastern Massachusetts, they produced wind damage from the Merrimack Valley into Boston and parts of the South Shore. Many trees were downed from Chelmsford to Lowell and Cape Ann. A National Weather Service Damage Survey conducted in Lowell concluded that a microburst with wind speeds estimated near 70 mph caused considerable damage. Numerous pine trees were snapped near their tops to about one-third of the way down. A car was flattened by a fallen tree at a baseball field along Pawtucket Boulevard just to the west of the water treatment plant. Damage also occurred on Varnum Avenue, one street farther north.In Greater Boston, a wind gust to 60 mph was observed at the Blue Hill Observatory in Milton. Trees and wires were reported down from Chelsea and Boston to West Roxbury, Dedham, and Needham. A trained spotter reported quarter sized hail in Stoughton. As the storms reach the South Shore, they continued to produce wind damage. Trees and wires were brought down in Hingham, Brockton, Taunton, Hanson, Whitman, and Kingston.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This activity was part of a widespread severe weather event across much of west Texas, including the Permian Basin where at least one significant tornado occurred. Severe convection erupted during the late afternoon hours along a warm front that was oriented west-to-east over the southern portions of the South Plains. These storms quickly evolved into supercells, and produced large hail, damaging winds, and at least four tornadoes. Although the tornadoes remained over open farmland, tornadic winds destroyed to center-pivot irrigation systems northwest of Brownfield (Terry County). This resulted in property losses of half a million dollars.The supercellular convection evolved into a cluster of severe multicell storms by early evening as it continued to propagate eastward along the boundary. A small linear complex characterized by a mini bow-shaped radar echo produced a locally intense downburst near Lake Alan Henry in southeastern Garza County. Winds estimated to exceed 90 MPH destroyed a number of mobile homes and vehicles near the lake, and injured one resident.Total economical losses sustained over the South Plains region during the outbreak were estimated to just under $1 million.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A wet microburst produced destructive winds that spread south through a small mobile home community at Lake Alan Henry near the intersection of Farm to Market Roads 2458 and 3519. One resident of the community was injured during the storm. A National Weather Service damage survey team estimated that winds associated with the microburst exceeded 90 MPH. One mobile home was blown toward the south and impacted two vehicles that were parked in front of an adjacent home. Debris, including the steel-frame structure of the mobile home, pushed the two vehicles up to 40 feet while the remains of the home were blown more than 40 yards into an open field. One vehicle was crushed by the weight of the flying debris. Another vehicle, a large truck, was reported by one of the residents to have been lifted in the front-end and then pushed across the yard. The tracks on the ground from the rear tires were noted by the survey team. Another mobile home was completely removed from its foundation and blown approximately 40 yards to the southeast into an open field. Lighter debris was scattered over 100 yards toward the south.Four other vehicles in the mobile home community also were damaged from flying debris. The front-end of a large truck was struck by a dumpster. A small sports utility Vehicle was impaled through a passenger side window by a ladder. Two other mobile homes sustained roof and window damages. An object impaled the top of one home, and residents reported major damage to the home's interior. The Texas Tech West Texas Mesonet station located one mile northwest of Lake Alan Henry measured a wind gust of 79 mph from the west/northwest at 7:40 PM.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 350K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

NWS meteorologist was accompanied by the Mclean County Emergency Manager. Damage was extensive and severe. Nearly every building in the town of about 80 people was damaged. The degree of damage varied with heavier damage to structures and trees on the west side of the town, including to a school built in 1916 and used until the mid 1960s. Just across highway 83, on the west side of town, an empty railroad coal car was off the tracks and on its side. The structural and tree damage pattern, coupled with comments from eye witnesses and 88D RADAR data, led to the determination that the event was a wet microburst with wind speeds in excess of 100 mph. Storms were multicellular in structure. Witnesses described a shelf cloud approaching, followed by the high wind, and then very heavy rain. There were two very minor injuries and no fatalities. The two injuries were in a camper that was rolled by the wind and destroyed. Coleharbor covers an area about 1/4 mile by 1/4 mile. Damage covered an area just under 4 km or just under 2 1/2 miles on a side. Outside of town the damage included a barn, many trees, and moved straw or hay bales. The ND Department of Transportation had weather instrumentation along highway 83 on the west side of Coleharbor. The Environmental Sensor Station had an engineered wind resistance of 120 mph and was lying on the ground following the storm. See photo.

About 27 county roads were blocked by fallen trees. At least one third of Henderson residents were without power, some for two to three days. A spokesperson for the utility company serving the region reported this was the most significant power loss in her five years with the company. Power lines were brought down along U.S. Highway 60 a few miles south of Henderson.  A few homes near Spottsville received major damage from falling trees.

The city of Mount Vernon was especially hard hit, where about 14 percent of all homes received at least minor damage. Several thousands of trees were blown down, landing on cars, power lines, roads, and houses. In the city of Mount Vernon, damage assessments indicated 1,107 homes were affected by some type of damage. 491 homes received minor damage such as roofs blown off, 152 received major damage (meaning they could be made habitable again), and 18 were destroyed. In addition, 446 other homes were affected, meaning damage was mainly cosmetic, such as shingles blown off. A business trailer owned by a construction company was blown over, landing across a roadway. Several hundred of the damaged homes sustained considerable roof damage, due to both falling trees and the direct effects of the wind. In south Mount Vernon near the intersection of Highways 142 and 37, an off-duty meteorologist reported virtually all trees were damaged, and many were blown down or uprooted. Most residential streets west of Route 37 were closed for at least a day due to fallen trees. Several people were trapped in their vehicles by fallen trees. The city's Wal-Mart store was evacuated after it sustained roof damage and a gas leak. About 80 patients of a nursing home were evacuated after it received roof damage. Windows were blown out of numerous structures. On Interstate 57, several semis were blown off the road or overturned, and a manufactured home was blown onto the southbound shoulder from a dealership located just off the highway. Gas pumps were blown over at service stations. Numerous street signs were blown down or damaged. Outside of the city of Mount Vernon in Jefferson County, one mobile home and two small permanent homes were destroyed, and around 100 other homes in the county sustained varying degrees of damage. The damaged homes included 27 in Woodlawn and eleven each in Bonnie and Nason. The roof of an elementary school in Woodlawn would likely require complete replacement. At least 11 classrooms were damaged, including some that were damaged by rainwater. Windows were blown out of houses around the county. At least 12 area residents, mostly in the city of Mount Vernon, sought treatment at a community hospital. Of those injured, about five were a direct result of the damaging wind. Power was out for several days in parts of the county. Damage to utility lines and poles was extensive. The primary utility company serving the county estimated damage to its property at over one million dollars.  Crop damage was considerable. This complex of storms caused widespread damage from where it originated in the St. Louis area east to Mount Vernon.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 13M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Much of North-Central Virginia including the Washington Metro Region experienced damages from the severe thunderstorms. The worst damages occurred in the Annandale area of Fairfax County. A NWS survey team concluded that damages were caused from a wet microburst. Winds associated with the microburst were around 70 mph. Extensive property damage occurred during these storms, including numerous downed trees and powerlines.

A dozen homes were damaged near Woodland Road in Annandale. According to newspaper accounts, three of the homes were evacuated due to structural damages and gas leaks. The extensive tree damage was likely exacerbated by weakened tree roots from the significant rains that occurred just a week earlier in late June.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The damage path began just southwest of Barkley Regional Airport, where several barns and sheds were unroofed. Minor roof damage occurred to a few homes. The damage became more significant along the western outskirts of Paducah, where numerous trees and large limbs were blown down. The emergency management director estimated over 100 trees were down. Numerous homes lost varying amounts of roofing, but the damage to structures was mostly minor. Trees fell on a few vehicles and structures, including a fire station. Vinyl siding was blown off at least one house. Most of the significant damage ended near the intersection of U.S. Highways 62 and 45 in Paducah, where a woman inside a store required treatment for cuts due to flying glass. On the south side of Paducah, the roof was partially blown off a restaurant.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Observations from the West Texas Mesonet station in Andrews reported a maximum wind gust of 55 mph.  The injured person had been hit in the face and chest by a corrugated metal fence panel and suffered blunt force trauma to the face and chest as well as a laceration that needed stitching.  A damage assessment was performed by the Andrews County emergency manager and sheriff's department personnel the following day.  They discovered that all debris was oriented from southwest to northeast and made the determination that all damage was caused by straight-line winds.  Damage consisted mostly of broken tree limbs, uprooted trees, damaged small metal storage buildings, displaced barn roofs, and fallen utility poles.  One semi-trailer was blown over, but did not appear to be damaged otherwise.  An abandoned house trailer had a portion of the roof blown off exposing framing and insulation.  A wood framed covered porch on an occupied house trailer was blown up and over the trailer, across the front yard, onto the other side of the street.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 6K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Severe weather during the overnight hours in June is quite rare but does occur on occasion. One of the overnight storms actually produced a rare June tornado! This overnight severe weather was likely a sign and just a taste of what was to come during the day on June 19th. As the overnight/early morning complex of storms shifted east, conditions were set just right for additional storms to redevelop to the west by late morning. The atmosphere recovered once more and became quite unstable in the wake of the morning complex. A very potent disturbance dropped south out of Arkansas and developed a large bow echo complex which plowed south across the forecast area. This bow echo was very efficient at producing severe wind gusts and a large swath of wind damage occurred as the system moved southward across Mississippi into Southeast Louisiana.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A few trees were blown down around Eagle Lake.

At the same time, a large MCS developed over northern Nebraska and tracked east into southern Minnesota into northern Iowa.  The airmass was quite unstable over Iowa and favorable for elevated convection as the system moved in.  CAPE values remained in the 2000 to 3500 J/kg range along and south of the boundary with lifted indices in the -8 range.  The environment was quite strongly sheared with 50 to 60 kts of shear. The downdraft CAPE was in the 500 to 700 J/kg range.  Thunderstorms intensified as they moved across Iowa with a small bow echo element developing as the MCS began to interact with the frontal boundary.  The event took shape as it moved into north central Iowa and produced 60 to 70 MPH winds as it moved from Kossuth County, east-southeast toward Tama County.  Hail was limited with the event as the freezing level had not changed much from the previous day and was still in the 15,500 foot range.  One report of three-quarter inch diameter hail was received from Franklin County.  There were numerous reports of tree and power line damage.  Two semitrailer trucks were blown off of Interstate 35 in southwest Cerro Gordo County between mile post 185 and 186.  The two drivers received minor injuries.  Reported wind damage included several out buildings and at least two barns flattened by high winds. Some of the harder hit areas were in Bremer County in the Plainfield area.  Barns were blown down, along with numerous trees and power poles.  The roof of a convenience store was peeled back in Plainfield.  Damage extended along U.S. Highway 218 from Plainfield north to at least the Chickasaw County line.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Two semis were blown over between mile markers 185 and 186 on interstate 35.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Dew point temperatures rose to the mid 60s to near 70 by late afternoon.  The airmass became relatively unstable, however the dynamics were somewhat limited.  The effective shear was in the 25 to 35 kt range.  The freezing level was between 12,000 and 13,000 feet, however the sounding was quite saturated which limited the hail somewhat.  The CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer was in the 200 to 300 J/kg range with the most unstable CAPE in the 1000 to 2000 J/lg range.  Lifted indices were in the -2 to -4 C. range.  A slow moving cold front entered western Iowa from the west during the late afternoon.  Thunderstorms formed along the front and lifted northeast.  Many of the storms produced large amounts of pea size hail, however very few produced any significant size hail.  Most of the hail was in the three quarter to one inch diameter range.    A bow echo segment formed along the east edge of the system and produced scattered reports of high winds.  A semi-tractortrailer was blown off the highway along Interstate 80 at the Stuart exit.  The truck overturned, blocking the highway and injuring the driver.  He was flown to hospital in Des Moines.  High winds snapped power poles southwest of Britt.  A severe thunderstorm in the Lake Mills area produced what appears to be a downburst wind gust that took the roof off of a grain bin and blew down 6 power poles.   A short time later, the same segment produced 61 MPH winds at the Waterloo Airport.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was supported by a very deep polar low intensifying across southeast Canada.  Very warm, humid, and unstable conditions continued in advance of this winterlike cold front.  A squall line of thunderstorms developed during the afternoon of the 3rd from the Ohio Valley into the Tennessee Valley.  This squall line continued to race out in advance of the front, reaching far north Georgia around midnight EDT and continued further south into central Georgia as a broken squall line during the early morning hours of the 4th.  Considerable wind damage occurred in association with the squall line across some north Georgia counties.  Several dozen homes were damaged in Hall county, including one blown off its foundation.  Other significant wind damage was noted in Dade and several other north Georgia counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A survey conducted by the National Weather Service in Peachtree City, Georgia and damage reports received from the Hall Emergency Management Director, a cooperative observer, and the public confirmed that a microburst with straight-line winds of 70 to 80 mph with isolated damage of 100-110 mph caused considerable damage to a subdivision just east of Interstate-985 and just south of Flowery Branch.  The path of damage was approximately one-half mile long and a mile wide.  At least 35 homes sustained roof and siding damage and dozens of large trees were blown down or completely uprooted in the area.  One home was blown 15 feet off its foundation and destroyed as it collapsed.  Windows were blown out of at least one home and several vehicles.  Other vehicles were damaged from downed trees or debris.  One man was injured when his locked and bolted door blew open with the winds and knocked him into a nearby wall.  There were reports of other trees down in the southern part of the county, but especially in the far southern part of the county near the Gwinnett county line.  The majority of the damage was confined to Devonshire, Hillsdale, and Glenmore Drives.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An inverted V signature was noted above the 950 mb level on the 00Z KNKX sounding that afternoon, indicative of the potential for thunderstorms to produce microbursts. Three elderly fishermen drowned after their overloaded, 12-foot motorboat capsized on Lake Henshaw while trying to outrun an approaching thunderstorm. Eyewitness accounts and observations support the idea that this thunderstorm may have produced a minor, sub-severe microburst. This was probably all that was needed to capsize the small, overloaded boat. A friend of the fishermen was the first to notice the capsized boat, however he did not actually see the boat flip over. It is still not completely known if the boat capsized before or after the thunderstorm moved across the lake.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A Severe Thunderstorm Watch was issued at 6:10 PM CDT and remained in effect until 1 AM CDT and was then extended until 5 AM as the line continued to push south. Damage reports began reaching the office around 9:30 PM CDT (8:30 MDT) as the line entered the northwestern portion of the forecast area and continued until 3:30 AM CDT when the line exited the forecast area.||As the storm entered Lea County New Mexico, reports of wind speeds in excess of 70 mph began coming into the office. These high winds continued as the line surged forward into West Texas. In Seminole, 98 mph (measured) wind speeds toppled several radio towers including a 320 foot tower that fell on a church and bus damaging both. In addition, the roof of Beall's Department store was destroyed and two mobile homes were rolled and destroyed injuring four people. ||As the line continued its southward progression, so did the damaging winds. Many locations began experiencing power outages including two of the three television stations in the Midland/Odessa area, and Midland International Airport. WFO Midland and the Gaines County Emergency Operation Center continued working on back up generator power until commercial power was restored to the area.  A 93 mph wind gust was measured at Midland International Airport just prior to the power loss, which rendered it inoperable for the remainder of the night.||The event continued into the early morning hours on Wednesday, where Dryden reported a 63 mph wind gust prior to thunderstorms exiting the area.||Post storm damage surveys indicated that damage across the area was caused by a derecho. A derecho is a ���widespread and long-lived wind storm associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms.��� ||While straight-line winds are common across West Texas ��� especially during the late spring and early summer ��� the magnitude of the wind speeds for this event is quite rare. As an example, the 93 mph wind reported in Midland eclipsed the old record of 86 mph set in February 1960, and was the strongest wind ever recorded in Midland since the NWS began official record keeping in 1930.||During this long-lived weather episode, all but two of the 26 counties within WFO Midland���s CWA experienced severe weather. The majority of these locations experienced high wind events, which resulted in power outages across the area. Because of backup power capability, WFO Midland was able to maintain warning operations throughout the entire severe weather event.||Summary of measured wind reports:||Dryden (K6R6) - 55 kts (63 mph)|Big Spring (KBPG) - 51 kts (59 mph)|Fort Stockton (KFST) - 57 kts (66 mph)|Guadalupe Pass (KGDP) - 62 kts (71 mph)|Wink (KINK) - 58 kts (67 mph)|Midland (KMAF) - 81 kts (93 mph)*|Odessa (KODO) - 55 kts (63 mph)|Seagraves 1 SW (KSGV) - 66 kts (76 mph)|Andrews 2 E (KANS) - 51 kts (59 mph)*|Seminole 2 NNE (KSMS) - 85 kts (98 mph)*|Lamesa 2 SE (KLES) - 45 kts (52 mph)*|Gail 2 ESE (KGGS) - 43 kts (50 mph)*|Pecos (KPEQ) - 56 kts (64 mph)|McDonald Observatory - 61 kts (70 mph)|Tatum, NM Co-op Observer - 68 kts (78 mph)||*These sites lost power shortly after observations, it may be assumed that peak wind gusts were somewhat higher than observed.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey was conducted by NWS personnel the morning following the winds.  The results of the damage survey follow.||Winds were measured at 97.5 mph at the West Texas Mesonet site two miles north northeast of Seminole, however, there is visual indication that wind speeds in some locations around Seminole, were at times even stronger ��� estimated in the range of 100-120 mph. Communication tower damage, where a tower measuring 320 feet in height fell on a church and another tall tower was bent into the shape of a rectangle, both suggest higher wind speed estimates. Additionally, three miles east southeast of Seminole along County Road 402, at least eight wooden power poles were snapped just above the ground. This further supports the idea that winds were at times greater than 100 mph.||NWS personnel found many trees were uprooted and tree limbs down. The entire town of Seminole experienced damage, with areas just west of downtown and just east of town being hardest hit by the damaging winds.||The extent of the wind damage prompted the Gaines County EOC to request EMS/Fire assistance from Hobbs, NM. Included in the damage were two mobile homes that were rolled.  One of these homes had four people inside, including one infant.  All four were injured and the infant was kept for observation overnight at a Lubbock hospital. ||Backup generators at the Emergency Operations center lost power as well as commercial power to much of Seminole.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The church sustained roof damage...resulting in water damage to the church's interior. The more significant damage with the event occurred east of Interstate 65 at the Super Wal-Mart on the Interstate 65 Service Road.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Eye witness interviews, archived radar data, photographic evidence and media reports indicate that a thunderstorm downburst with peak winds of 70 mph, accompanied by a gustnado along the leading edge of the gustfront, was the cause of the damage that occurred in the vicinity of the I-65 and Dauphin Street interchange at around 120 pm CST on the afternoon of July 3.  |A short lived gustnado developed along the leading edge of the thunderstorm downburst near the Dauphin Way Baptist Church, just on the west side of I-65. Most reports indicate that the gustnado was visible along the gustfront for 30 to 60 seconds. Slight damage occurred to a couple of trees along Dauphin Street near the church. In that same area a car was damaged when it was pushed into a tree. The occupant of the car was wearing a seat belt and was uninjured, but the back window of the car was shattered and some body damage to the vehicle occurred. In addition, an approximate 5 by 8 foot section of shingles was torn away from the roof of the Dauphin Way Baptist Church, resulting in water damage to the church's interior. |The gustfront and accompanying gustnado then quickly moved east across I-65. A National Weather Service interview with a motorists driving on the I-65 southbound on-ramp indicates that the strong crosswinds hit the vehicle just as it was merging onto the southbound lane of the interstate. The driver reported that his vehicle was spun around twice, ending up facing north in the southbound lanes of I-65. Luckily no oncoming traffic was in the vicinity at the time, and the motorist was not injured and only minimal damage occurred to the vehicle. The driver reported that it was not raining before the gustfront hit, but did rain very heavily just after the event, which is classic evidence of a typical thunderstorm downburst.     |The more significant damage associated with the event then occurred just east of I-65 at the Super Wal-Mart on the I-65 service road. Eyewitness reports and a National Weather Service storm survey indicate that the thunderstorm downburst, still accompanied by the gustnado, reached its peak intensity near the Wal-Mart store. Several sections of roofing material near the back of the store were torn away after high winds, estimated by public reports, observed damage and radar data to have been around 70 mph, blew a large air conditioning unit off the roof. These strong winds were then funneled off the roof of the store and downward into the rear parking lot, where a minivan with several passengers was nearly overturned and sustained window damage, most likely due to flying debris. Five people in the van suffered minor injuries.  As a result of the wind damage to sections of the stores roof, significant water damage then occurred to much of the interior of the store. Some minor wind damage was also noted at the garden section of the store, where light weight roofing materials and numerous other small objects were blown 50 to 100 yards downwind from the store. A large tarp that was hung along a fence was also blown down. The 70 mph estimate is supported by the observed nature of the damage in a localized area and the near complete lack of any other damage in the vicinity. Three people in Wal-Mart were injured. One of the persons who was injured later died from an Aneurysm, but it is unknown if this was a result of the injury.    |No other significant damage was reported anywhere in Mobile county.|<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several different waves of thunderstorms formed and moved across the region beginning in the morning of the 17th and ending in the evening. Very strong wind shear had also developed through a large depth of the atmosphere, which supported organized thunderstorms and even supercells. The most widespread damage occurred as a result of a squall line that developed on the dry line to the west and moved into eastern Oklahoma during the early evening. Embedded bow echo thunderstorms and supercells resulted in numerous reports of large hail and very strong wind up to about 90 mph.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Strong thunderstorm winds with gusts estimated up to 80 miles an hour moved into the Tulsa area. Oktoberfest, an annual outdoor festival, was underway at the time. The wind destroyed several large tents at the venue, in which hundreds of people were located as the storms moved through the area. At least fifty people were injured when the tents collapsed and/or from flying debris, two of which were critically injured.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Erin moved onshore near Lamar, TX as a weak tropical storm, but was quickly downgraded to a tropical depression as it moved over land. The tropical depression moved northwest over the Edwards Plateau toward west Texas. Erin maintained her depression status as it then began to move northeast into southwest Oklahoma between Hollis and Erick during the afternoon hours of Saturday, August 18th. A very tropical airmass was in place along and east of this feature, extending into western and central Oklahoma. Heavy rainfall developed along and east of the center, which moved slowly to the northeast. Low-level wind shear north and east of Erin increased throughout the evening, with several tornadoes reported in Kiowa, Washita, and Grady counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Damage was reported east of Hobart, and in Washita county south and east of Cordell. As the evening progressed, a strong low-level jet developed, with additional thunderstorms developing over southwest and central Oklahoma. Remarkably, the center of the tropical depression strengthened between 1 and 7 AM, with a compact area of sustained winds of 35 to 45 MPH concentrated around the center of the depression. Wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph were also reported over parts of central Oklahoma at this time. As with the wind speeds, thunderstorms intensities increased, with two additional tornadoes reported over central Oklahoma Sunday morning. In addition to tornadoes and very strong winds, rainfall rates of over three inches per hour were common, with significant flash flooding reported in numerous counties. Rainfall amounts exceeded five inches over a large area, with some locations receiving eight to ten inches. Rivers and creeks easily exceeded their banks, with water also rising quickly in many towns. Dozens of people were rescued by boat and helicopter as numerous homes and businesses quickly took on water. Unfortunately, six people lost their lives due to the flooding. Monetary values were estimated.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Widespread wind damage was reported in and around Geary as strong winds battered the city for several hours. Numerous trees, power poles, and power lines were downed. The Fast Lane Food Mart had its awning ripped off. Numerous signs were blown over. Part of the roof of the nursing home was ripped off. Two persons were injured while evacuating the nursing home. Siding was also removed from a house, and the garage doors were blown inward.
