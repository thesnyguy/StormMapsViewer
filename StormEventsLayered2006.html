The second was from just west and southwest of Columbus eastward to the Alabama state line.The first swath of damage downed numerous trees and power lines. Many homes sustained roof and shingle damage with a few homes sustaining minor structural damage. One home, which was under construction, was completely leveled. Most of this this damage occurred in and around the Caledonia Community.The second swath of damage started just southwest of Columbus and pushed east right through town and toward the Alabama state line. The damage began with several highway signs blown down along Highway 82. The winds grew stronger as the squall line neared town. Extensive damage occurred across the south side of town and point just to the east of town. Hundreds of trees were snapped or blown down with dozens of large trees uprooted. Many power lines and power poles were taken down as well. Nearly 25 roads were blocked from downed trees and power lines. Many homes sustained roof and shingle damage with several homes sustaining significant roof damage. Many sheds and outbuildings were damaged or destroyed. Five to ten homes had trees fall on them caused major damage. An apartment complex just east of town had extensive roof damage and a few trees on some of the buildings.

Though somewhat early in  the season for such a storm, the storm was a classic storm.  As it quite typical of April or  May, the storm was a classic "bowling ball" type system with a closed upper low lifting northeast out of the southwest U.S.  Surface low pressure moved from Kansas into Southwest Iowa during the event.  A dryline pushed northeast with the low into the state.  Strong moisture transport took place ahead of the storm with dew points reaching the mid 50s to low 60s over Iowa as afternoon temperatures were in the 60 to 70 degree range.  Strong south winds in the low levels were in place with speeds in the 35 to 45 kt range.  The atmosphere destabilized during the afternoon with lifted indices reaching -7 by the early afternoon.  CAPE values were not all that great, at about 1000 J/kg.  The freezing level during the storms was relatively low, at about 10,700 feet.  Thunderstorms developed in western Iowa and lifted northeast at 50 to 55 MPH during the afternoon.  These formed in the warm sector.  At the same time, the dryline pushed into western Iowa during the late afternoon.  The storms from the dryline produced hail and strong winds, along with 2 small tornadoes.  The line of storms took on a bow echo appearance as they raced across the state.  The storms that formed ahead of the dryline were not as significant and produced only marginal severe weather.  As the dryline storms moved in, reports of hail and high wind were numerous.  Two small tornadoes touched down briefly, causing little damage.  One was west of the Creston Airport in Union County, the second was near De Soto in Dallas County.  Minor damage occurred with the tornado west of Creston as it damaged breeze way and carport there.  High winds were quite wide spread with wind speeds reaching or exceeding 80 MPH at times.  In Latimer winds of 80 MPH took the roof off of a building for example.  In Franklin County,  high winds lifted bleachers and threw them 300 feet, across a road.  Damage was reported to an apartment building roof in Crawford County and a dugout destroyed as well.  Several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being overturned were received.  One was overturned in Crawford County on the Shelby County line, 6 were overturned in Adair County by 71 MPH winds with one person receiving minor injuries.  Six trucks were blown off the highway in Guthrie County and another in Story County.  Two people were injured in Boone County when high winds blew a tree onto a mobile home.

Though somewhat early in  the season for such a storm, the storm was a classic storm.  As it quite typical of April or  May, the storm was a classic "bowling ball" type system with a closed upper low lifting northeast out of the southwest U.S.  Surface low pressure moved from Kansas into Southwest Iowa during the event.  A dryline pushed northeast with the low into the state.  Strong moisture transport took place ahead of the storm with dew points reaching the mid 50s to low 60s over Iowa as afternoon temperatures were in the 60 to 70 degree range.  Strong south winds in the low levels were in place with speeds in the 35 to 45 kt range.  The atmosphere destabilized during the afternoon with lifted indices reaching -7 by the early afternoon.  CAPE values were not all that great, at about 1000 J/kg.  The freezing level during the storms was relatively low, at about 10,700 feet.  Thunderstorms developed in western Iowa and lifted northeast at 50 to 55 MPH during the afternoon.  These formed in the warm sector.  At the same time, the dryline pushed into western Iowa during the late afternoon.  The storms from the dryline produced hail and strong winds, along with 2 small tornadoes.  The line of storms took on a bow echo appearance as they raced across the state.  The storms that formed ahead of the dryline were not as significant and produced only marginal severe weather.  As the dryline storms moved in, reports of hail and high wind were numerous.  Two small tornadoes touched down briefly, causing little damage.  One was west of the Creston Airport in Union County, the second was near De Soto in Dallas County.  Minor damage occurred with the tornado west of Creston as it damaged breeze way and carport there.  High winds were quite wide spread with wind speeds reaching or exceeding 80 MPH at times.  In Latimer winds of 80 MPH took the roof off of a building for example.  In Franklin County,  high winds lifted bleachers and threw them 300 feet, across a road.  Damage was reported to an apartment building roof in Crawford County and a dugout destroyed as well.  Several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being overturned were received.  One was overturned in Crawford County on the Shelby County line, 6 were overturned in Adair County by 71 MPH winds with one person receiving minor injuries.  Six trucks were blown off the highway in Guthrie County and another in Story County.  Two people were injured in Boone County when high winds blew a tree onto a mobile home.  The mobile home was totally destroyed.  Three mobile homes were flipped in Story County by the high winds.  Reports of damage to outbuildings were too numerous to mention here.  Hail reports were quite numerous.  Much of the hail was around an inch in diameter. One of the storms produced large hail in the Des Moines Metro area.  Two inch diameter hail fell in Des Moines, with golf ball size hail in Norwalk and one and one half inch diameter hail falling at the Des Moines Airport.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A trailer park also sustained damage. Numerous telephone poles and trees were blown down. Many trees and cars on the Kansas University campus were damaged. More than 70 of Kansas University's 116 buildings received some damage. Many homes in the city also sustained damage. Video of the event indicated a microburst with winds of 70 to 90 mph. Several notable events reflected the severity of the wind damage. A heating/cooling unit was blown from the roof of a campus residence hall and landed on a car. Several semi-trucks were blown onto their sides. Two brick spires were toppled from one of the city's oldest churches dating back to 1870. Two 60 foot tall silos at a country market near Lawrence were destroyed. Three 500 pound ventilators atop a junior high building were blown off the roof...one landing nearly 100 yards away. Each ventilator was 6 feet tall and 5 feet wide. The emergency manager of Douglas county estimated total damage at 8 million dollars of which 6 million dollars occurred on the Kansas University campus alone.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The time frame was late on a Friday afternoon and into the early evening.The initial severe weather was large hail.  However, the storms following the initial cells, consolidated and organized into a squall line.  On its leading edge, severe wind gust moved out of Pike County Kentucky and through Mingo County around 1630E.  Trees fell and damaged a few homes.  Several commercial and residential buildings in Williamson sustained damage from the wind alone.  A large portion of the damage was to awnings, porches, siding, and roofs.  Signs and poles were also damaged.  Two women received injuries to their legs when the wooden pavilion near the river collapsed.  Debris littered the downtown streets.  The strong wind gust blew through eastern Logan County.  Windows were blown out of 3 or 4 businesses in Man.  In the Elk Creek region of Logan County, a woman was trapped on her bed in a mobile home. A tree had fallen into the house and laid across the bed.  The railings of the hospital type bed helped prevent a more serious injury.  In McDowell County, 3 mobile homes were damaged.  In Wyoming County, a roof was damaged near Baileysville.Brief and sudden wind gusts of 60 to 85 mph were likely on the leading edge of the squall line, with the speed dependent on exposure and channeling of the wind through the valleys and hollows.  In the case of downtown Williamson, channeling of the wind between buildings also came into play.  No tornadoes were confirmed or indicated by weather radar.As this complex moved through Fayette and Raleigh Counties, large hail again occurred.  Hail as big as golf balls fell around Beckley and Grandview.  One major insurance company reported about 450 claims, mostly vehicular hail damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 900K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Signs and poles were also damaged.  Two women received injuries to their legs when the wooden pavilion near the river collapsed.  Debris littered the downtown streets.  The strong wind gust blew through eastern Logan County.  Windows were blown out of 3 or 4 businesses in Man.  In the Elk Creek region of Logan County, a woman was trapped on her bed in a mobile home. A tree had fallen into the house and laid across the bed.  The railings of the hospital type bed helped prevent a more serious injury.  In McDowell County, 3 mobile homes were damaged.  In Wyoming County, a roof was damaged near Baileysville.Brief and sudden wind gusts of 60 to 85 mph were likely on the leading edge of the squall line, with the speed dependent on exposure and channeling of the wind through the valleys and hollows.  In the case of downtown Williamson, channeling of the wind between buildings also came into play.  No tornadoes were confirmed or indicated by weather radar.As this complex moved through Fayette and Raleigh Counties, large hail again occurred.  Hail as big as golf balls fell around Beckley and Grandview.  One major insurance company reported about 450 claims, mostly vehicular hail damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

His 12-year-old son was slightly injured. The mobile home was rolled and became pinned against a large tree. A National Weather Service site survey indicated that straight-line winds from 70 to 80 MPH were responsible for a path of widespread damage from Dexter eastward to Circle City, which is almost to the county line. In Dexter, considerable damage occurred. Numerous trees were blown down, and many roofs were damaged. The city received nearly 150 calls concerning downed trees. Trees fell on at least three cars and two trucks. Just in the three Dexter city parks, about a dozen trees were down. Power was out in parts of Dexter for up to two days. Part of the roof of a convenience store was blown off, and a storage shed was destroyed. Two vehicles at the convenience store were damaged by the roof. Dexter city hall sustained minor damage. An amateur radio antenna was bent 90 degrees. In Essex, which is between Dexter and Circle City, several homes and businesses had sections of shingles blown off. Some trees were snapped or uprooted. About 250,000 dollars damage occurred to agricultural equipment and machinery at two agribusinesses near Essex.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 400K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The thunderstorms initially downed trees and wires in western and central Massachusetts, from Amherst and West Springfield to Hardwick, Sterling, Northborough, and Southborough. A nine year old child was injured in Northborough and there was some structural damage to a shopping center on Route 9. There were also reports of large hail including penny sized hail in Sterling and Northborough, quarter sized hail in Webster, and quarter to half dollar sized hail in West Boylston.Lightning also caused considerable damage in central Massachusetts. A large tree was struck by lightning in Spencer which traveled into a nearby house, igniting a fire that left the home uninhabitable. Lightning also struck the radio tower of the Massachusetts State Police barracks in Charlton, severely damaging the radio communication system. No injuries were reported in either case.As the thunderstorms reached eastern Massachusetts, they produced wind damage from the Merrimack Valley into Boston and parts of the South Shore. Many trees were downed from Chelmsford to Lowell and Cape Ann. A National Weather Service Damage Survey conducted in Lowell concluded that a microburst with wind speeds estimated near 70 mph caused considerable damage. Numerous pine trees were snapped near their tops to about one-third of the way down. A car was flattened by a fallen tree at a baseball field along Pawtucket Boulevard just to the west of the water treatment plant. Damage also occurred on Varnum Avenue, one street farther north.In Greater Boston, a wind gust to 60 mph was observed at the Blue Hill Observatory in Milton. Trees and wires were reported down from Chelsea and Boston to West Roxbury, Dedham, and Needham. A trained spotter reported quarter sized hail in Stoughton. As the storms reach the South Shore, they continued to produce wind damage. Trees and wires were brought down in Hingham, Brockton, Taunton, Hanson, Whitman, and Kingston.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Two people had to be rescued in Southwick, when gusty winds from the storms overturned their canoe.As the storms progressed into central Massachusetts, they downed trees in Worcester County from Hardwick to Northborough, one of which narrowly missed hitting a police cruiser. A nine-year old child was injured in Northborough by falling debris and there was structural damage to a building. Quarter sized hail fell in Webster, and quarter to dollar sized hail was reported in West Boylston.Wind damage was more severe in eastern Massachusetts. A National Weather Service Storm Survey concluded that a microburst occurred in Lowell with estimated wind speeds of 70 mph. Many pine trees were snapped near their tops to about one-third of the way down. A car was flattened by a fallen tree at a baseball field along Pawtucket Boulevard. Damage was also noted on Varnum Avenue, one block farther to the north.Elsewhere, there were many reports of trees falling on cars around greater Boston, including the western and southern suburbs. A wind gust to 60 mph was recorded at Blue Hill Observatory in Milton. Quarter sized hail fell in Stoughton and penny sized hail was reported in Salem.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This activity was part of a widespread severe weather event across much of west Texas, including the Permian Basin where at least one significant tornado occurred. Severe convection erupted during the late afternoon hours along a warm front that was oriented west-to-east over the southern portions of the South Plains. These storms quickly evolved into supercells, and produced large hail, damaging winds, and at least four tornadoes. Although the tornadoes remained over open farmland, tornadic winds destroyed to center-pivot irrigation systems northwest of Brownfield (Terry County). This resulted in property losses of half a million dollars.The supercellular convection evolved into a cluster of severe multicell storms by early evening as it continued to propagate eastward along the boundary. A small linear complex characterized by a mini bow-shaped radar echo produced a locally intense downburst near Lake Alan Henry in southeastern Garza County. Winds estimated to exceed 90 MPH destroyed a number of mobile homes and vehicles near the lake, and injured one resident.Total economical losses sustained over the South Plains region during the outbreak were estimated to just under $1 million.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A wet microburst produced destructive winds that spread south through a small mobile home community at Lake Alan Henry near the intersection of Farm to Market Roads 2458 and 3519. One resident of the community was injured during the storm. A National Weather Service damage survey team estimated that winds associated with the microburst exceeded 90 MPH. One mobile home was blown toward the south and impacted two vehicles that were parked in front of an adjacent home. Debris, including the steel-frame structure of the mobile home, pushed the two vehicles up to 40 feet while the remains of the home were blown more than 40 yards into an open field. One vehicle was crushed by the weight of the flying debris. Another vehicle, a large truck, was reported by one of the residents to have been lifted in the front-end and then pushed across the yard. The tracks on the ground from the rear tires were noted by the survey team. Another mobile home was completely removed from its foundation and blown approximately 40 yards to the southeast into an open field. Lighter debris was scattered over 100 yards toward the south.Four other vehicles in the mobile home community also were damaged from flying debris. The front-end of a large truck was struck by a dumpster. A small sports utility Vehicle was impaled through a passenger side window by a ladder. Two other mobile homes sustained roof and window damages. An object impaled the top of one home, and residents reported major damage to the home's interior. The Texas Tech West Texas Mesonet station located one mile northwest of Lake Alan Henry measured a wind gust of 79 mph from the west/northwest at 7:40 PM.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 350K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

NWS meteorologist was accompanied by the Mclean County Emergency Manager. Damage was extensive and severe. Nearly every building in the town of about 80 people was damaged. The degree of damage varied with heavier damage to structures and trees on the west side of the town, including to a school built in 1916 and used until the mid 1960s. Just across highway 83, on the west side of town, an empty railroad coal car was off the tracks and on its side. The structural and tree damage pattern, coupled with comments from eye witnesses and 88D RADAR data, led to the determination that the event was a wet microburst with wind speeds in excess of 100 mph. Storms were multicellular in structure. Witnesses described a shelf cloud approaching, followed by the high wind, and then very heavy rain. There were two very minor injuries and no fatalities. The two injuries were in a camper that was rolled by the wind and destroyed. Coleharbor covers an area about 1/4 mile by 1/4 mile. Damage covered an area just under 4 km or just under 2 1/2 miles on a side. Outside of town the damage included a barn, many trees, and moved straw or hay bales. The ND Department of Transportation had weather instrumentation along highway 83 on the west side of Coleharbor. The Environmental Sensor Station had an engineered wind resistance of 120 mph and was lying on the ground following the storm. See photo.

About 27 county roads were blocked by fallen trees. At least one third of Henderson residents were without power, some for two to three days. A spokesperson for the utility company serving the region reported this was the most significant power loss in her five years with the company. Power lines were brought down along U.S. Highway 60 a few miles south of Henderson.  A few homes near Spottsville received major damage from falling trees.

The city of Mount Vernon was especially hard hit, where about 14 percent of all homes received at least minor damage. Several thousands of trees were blown down, landing on cars, power lines, roads, and houses. In the city of Mount Vernon, damage assessments indicated 1,107 homes were affected by some type of damage. 491 homes received minor damage such as roofs blown off, 152 received major damage (meaning they could be made habitable again), and 18 were destroyed. In addition, 446 other homes were affected, meaning damage was mainly cosmetic, such as shingles blown off. A business trailer owned by a construction company was blown over, landing across a roadway. Several hundred of the damaged homes sustained considerable roof damage, due to both falling trees and the direct effects of the wind. In south Mount Vernon near the intersection of Highways 142 and 37, an off-duty meteorologist reported virtually all trees were damaged, and many were blown down or uprooted. Most residential streets west of Route 37 were closed for at least a day due to fallen trees. Several people were trapped in their vehicles by fallen trees. The city's Wal-Mart store was evacuated after it sustained roof damage and a gas leak. About 80 patients of a nursing home were evacuated after it received roof damage. Windows were blown out of numerous structures. On Interstate 57, several semis were blown off the road or overturned, and a manufactured home was blown onto the southbound shoulder from a dealership located just off the highway. Gas pumps were blown over at service stations. Numerous street signs were blown down or damaged. Outside of the city of Mount Vernon in Jefferson County, one mobile home and two small permanent homes were destroyed, and around 100 other homes in the county sustained varying degrees of damage. The damaged homes included 27 in Woodlawn and eleven each in Bonnie and Nason. The roof of an elementary school in Woodlawn would likely require complete replacement. At least 11 classrooms were damaged, including some that were damaged by rainwater. Windows were blown out of houses around the county. At least 12 area residents, mostly in the city of Mount Vernon, sought treatment at a community hospital. Of those injured, about five were a direct result of the damaging wind.

Much of North-Central Virginia including the Washington Metro Region experienced damages from the severe thunderstorms. The worst damages occurred in the Annandale area of Fairfax County. A NWS survey team concluded that damages were caused from a wet microburst. Winds associated with the microburst were around 70 mph. Extensive property damage occurred during these storms, including numerous downed trees and powerlines. Local power companies reported in excess of 100,000 power outages in the Washington Metro Region from this bought of severe weather.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> NWS Storm Survey indicated a wet microburst produced near 70 mph winds. A dozen homes were damaged near Woodland Road in Annandale. According to newspaper accounts, three of the homes were evacuated due to structural damages and gas leaks. The extensive tree damage was likely exacerbated by weakened tree roots from the significant rains that occurred just a week earlier in late June.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The damage became more significant along the western outskirts of Paducah, where numerous trees and large limbs were blown down. The emergency management director estimated over 100 trees were down. Numerous homes lost varying amounts of roofing, but the damage to structures was mostly minor. Trees fell on a few vehicles and structures, including a fire station. Vinyl siding was blown off at least one house. Most of the significant damage ended near the intersection of U.S. Highways 62 and 45 in Paducah, where a woman inside a store required treatment for cuts due to flying glass. On the south side of Paducah, the roof was partially blown off a restaurant.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Observations from the West Texas Mesonet station in Andrews reported a maximum wind gust of 55 mph.  The injured person had been hit in the face and chest by a corrugated metal fence panel and suffered blunt force trauma to the face and chest as well as a laceration that needed stitching.  A damage assessment was performed by the Andrews County emergency manager and sheriff's department personnel the following day.  They discovered that all debris was oriented from southwest to northeast and made the determination that all damage was caused by straight-line winds.  Damage consisted mostly of broken tree limbs, uprooted trees, damaged small metal storage buildings, displaced barn roofs, and fallen utility poles.  One semi-trailer was blown over, but did not appear to be damaged otherwise.  An abandoned house trailer had a portion of the roof blown off exposing framing and insulation.  A wood framed covered porch on an occupied house trailer was blown up and over the trailer, across the front yard, onto the other side of the street.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 6K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The damage to power lines included several large transmission circuit structures one mile south of Tea being blown down along a half mile stretch. A resulting power outage lasted up to 4 hours and affected about 4,000 electrical customers. The tree damage included at least 3 trees, each 2 feet in diameter, being broken off 2 to 3 feet above the ground. One man's arm was broken when the winds tossed him and a garage door. The winds tore the roof off a paving business, destroyed several small sheds, and damaged several residential gardens. Several homes suffered minor roof and siding damage, some directly from the wind, and others from tree debris. The winds caused a semi truck to veer out of its lane and sideswipe a car on Interstate 29, after which the semi overturned. Several roads were blocked by tree debris.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> .5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong jet stream and low-level jet interacted with an unseasonably warm, moist air mass in place across the southeast part of middle Georgia to generate a narrow squall line during the early morning hours.  This resulted in wind damage in Telfair, Wheeler, Montgomery, and Emanuel counties in the far southeast part of Middle Georgia.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Montgomery County Emergency Management Director reported that extensive wind damage occurred across the northern part of the county.  The most significant damage was observed in the Kibbee area in the far northern part of the county.  Here, a trailer was removed from its foundation, the foundation blocks of which poked holes in the trailer's floor.  Nearby, a site-built home was damaged on Bear Creek Road, resulting in the injury, possibly in the form of a broken leg, to a female.  Near Tarrytown, several aluminum carports were picked up by the strong winds and thrown onto homes.  Just south of Tarrytown, a 30 by 25 foot barn was destroyed.  Minor roof damage was also reported to a few homes in the area.  In Mt Vernon, a portion of a roof was blown of a home and a few trees were down on power lines.  Just northeast of Mount Vernon, in Ailey, a storage shed was destroyed.  Numerous trees and power lines were down from Tarrytown, to Kibbee, to Higgston.  Several roads were blocked between Tarrytown and Kibbee.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several urban areas had significant street flooding.  The Sacramento weir was opened for the first time since 1997 with twenty gates opened.  - Transportation throughout the area was difficult during the course of the storms as airports were closed due to the high winds and major road closures resulted from flooding and mudslides.  Interstate 80...the main artery between Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay area...was closed near Fairfield in Solano County for several hours due to severe flooding.  Additionally, Interstate 80 eastbound between Sacramento and Reno, NV, was closed for more than a day due to a massive mudslide, as was both directions of U.S. Highway 50 between Sacramento and South Lake Tahoe.- The primary weather impacts were due to flooding.  Snow levels during this period of precipitation were high...around 7000 to 8000 feet along much of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.  - Three deaths occurred due to these storms.  A Solano County man was killed by a falling tree, a Lake County man drowned while fishing during the storm, and a Stanislaus County woman died while crossing a flooding stream on foot.- Counties declared in need of federal disaster assistance include: Alpine, Amador, Butte, Colusa, El Dorado, Lake, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Shasta, Solano, Sutter, Yolo, and Yuba.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Genevieve County near Highway NN and just west of the community of Giboney. The tornado moved northeast, crossing Interstate 55 only about one-half mile from the Ste. Genevieve County line. Two fatalities and F3 damage occurred in the vicinity of where the tornado crossed U.S. Route 61. The two fatalities occurred on U.S. 61, where a vehicle was picked up and thrown into a propane tank. The truck in which they were riding was likely picked up, flipped over, and slammed into the ground several times. The coroner stated that the victims died instantly. One of the victims was ejected from the truck, which then struck the top of a large propane tank. Because of the ensuing propane leak, the victim still in the truck could not be removed until the following day, when the propane was off-loaded from the tank. Both of the victims in the vehicle were residents of a mobile home who were trying to flee the tornado. The home from which they fled sustained only minor damage. At least four other people were significantly injured as they were picked up by tornadic winds and hurled 100 yards. Their injuries were compounded by wind-blown debris. Eight victims were admitted to a local hospital to remove debris which penetrated their bodies, and two others were sent to regional hospitals for serious injuries. Three mobile homes were flattened, a brick house had its roof and several walls blown off, and numerous vehicles were tossed around. A total of about a dozen residences were destroyed or severely damaged in Perry County. Perry County was designated a federal disaster area, enabling individual residents to apply for relief. The dashboard camera in a sheriff deputy's patrol car captured the tornado on film as it crossed U.S. 61 at F3 intensity. Peak winds were estimated near 170 MPH.  The tornado crossed into Randolph County, Illinois at Old River, near some railroad tracks about 1.5 miles southeast of St. Marys.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Genevieve County near Highway NN and just west of the community of Giboney. The tornado moved northeast, crossing Interstate 55 only about one-half mile from the Ste. Genevieve County line. Two fatalities and F3 damage occurred in the vicinity of where the tornado crossed U.S. Route 61. The two fatalities occurred on U.S. 61, where a vehicle was picked up and thrown into a propane tank. The truck in which they were riding was likely picked up, flipped over, and slammed into the ground several times. The coroner stated that the victims died instantly. One of the victims was ejected from the truck, which then struck the top of a large propane tank. Because of the ensuing propane leak, the victim still in the truck could not be removed until the following day, when the propane was off-loaded from the tank. Both of the victims in the vehicle were residents of a mobile home who were trying to flee the tornado. The home from which they fled sustained only minor damage. At least four other people were significantly injured as they were picked up by tornadic winds and hurled 100 yards. Their injuries were compounded by wind-blown debris. Eight victims were admitted to a local hospital to remove debris which penetrated their bodies, and two others were sent to regional hospitals for serious injuries. Three mobile homes were flattened, a brick house had its roof and several walls blown off, and numerous vehicles were tossed around. A total of about a dozen residences were destroyed or severely damaged in Perry County. Perry County was designated a federal disaster area, enabling individual residents to apply for relief. The dashboard camera in a sheriff deputy's patrol car captured the tornado on film as it crossed U.S. 61 at F3 intensity. Peak winds were estimated near 170 MPH.  The tornado crossed into Randolph County, Illinois at Old River, near some railroad tracks about 1.5 miles southeast of St. Marys.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It destroyed two chicken houses at the International Poultry Breeders, killing 5,000 chickens and condemning another 15,000.  The tornado sideswiped a restaurant, but snapped off several large pines around the building.  One tree fell through the roof.  A small shelter on the property was destroyed.  Over open fields, several metal sheds were damaged or destroyed, and irrigation pivots were overturned.  Five homes were destroyed, eight received heavy damage, and seven sustained moderate damage.  Many power poles were toppled.  A man suffered scratches to his left arm after part of the ceiling of his mobile home collapsed on him.  The tornado lifted over Lanyer Sumner Road near the Colquitt-Cook county line.

It then moved northeastward and skirted County Road 49, then moved across a large wooded area and open pasture area. Several hundred trees were snapped off and uprooted near the beginning of the tornado damage path. As the tornado traveled northeast, a large warehouse at a family owned sod farm was completely destroyed. An office used by the sod farm was heavily damaged due to a large tree falling on it. The tornado crossed US 82 between the Comer community and the Batesville community. As the tornado crossed US 82, an automobile was tossed some 80 feet off the roadway. One male occupant of the car was injured and transported to the hospital.  The tornado traveled just over a mile past US 82 and snapped off several hundred more trees before lifting north of US 82 near Bear Creek at approximately 1233 PM CST. The tornado snapped off many hundreds of trees along its path. One warehouse was destroyed, one office was heavily damaged, and one home sustained roof damage. Metal tin from the roof of a shed was thrown at least a half mile down the tornado path.  At least one automobile was damaged and one man was injured.

Five homes along the path were extensively damaged or destroyed.  One home was moved 60 feet from its foundation.  Two vehicles were thrown 250 yards.  Several farm structures were also damaged in the area.  A number of trees and power lines were also down in the area.  Three injuries were reported during the event.  Two men that were working in a barn were injured when the tornado blew the barn away.  A third man was injured while clinging to a fence post that the tornado ripped from the ground.  The tornado had an overall path length of 3 miles with a path width of 1/4 mile.  One interesting note is that family photographs from one of the homes destroyed near Hollonville were found as far away as Williamson, near the Spalding county line.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 750K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Five homes along the path were extensively damaged or destroyed.  One home was moved 60 feet from its foundation.  Two vehicles were thrown 250 yards.  Several farm structures were also damaged in the area.  A number of trees and power lines were also down in the area.  Three injuries were reported during the event.  Two men that were working in a barn were injured when the tornado blew the barn away.  A third man was injured while clinging to a fence post that the tornado ripped from the ground.  The tornado had an overall path length of 3 miles with a path width of 1/4 mile.  One interesting note is that family photographs from one of the homes destroyed near Hollonville were found as far away as Williamson, near the Spalding county line.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 750K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Shortly after crossing into Perry County, some coal trucks were blown over, and a modular home was totally destroyed on Route 154 near Route 150. Two persons in the home were trapped inside for a time, but they sustained only minor injuries that were treated at a local hospital.

Near where it crossed Illinois Route 13, trees were uprooted, roofs were blown off, and power poles were snapped. Siding was blown off a house. Near the end of the tornado track, just northwest of Tamaroa, a metal building was destroyed. Debris from the building was blown about 400 yards. A nearby house lost all of its shingles. Along the 20-mile path through Perry County, dozens of barns and outbuildings were severely damaged or destroyed. Dozens of homes sustained varying degrees of damage, ranging from minor to major. Hundreds of trees were uprooted or snapped.  Peak winds on this county segment were estimated at 140 MPH, mainly near the Randolph County line. The average path width was close to 200 yards.

A house was unroofed and another damaged just east of Collin County Road 477.  Trees and power lines were also downed.  A roof was damaged along FM 2862 west of Collin County Road 480.  The tornado ranged from an F1 to an F2 on the Fujita Tornado Intensity Scale during this part of its lifetime.  The tornado then turned on a slightly more northerly track.The tornado reached its maximum intensity of F3 as it crossed FM 3133 just north of the Westminster community.  Vegetation west of FM 3133 was scoured.  Two homes were heavily damaged south of Collin County Road 531.

These storms evolved into splitting supercells, and resulted in large hail up to two inches in diameter in Dickens and Motley Counties. The anticyclonic member from one of the mentioned storms propagated northward over Childress County during the early evening hours. The storm effectively lowered temperature-to-dewpoint depressions and locally backed the near-surface winds. A classic supercell subsequently propagated southeastward out of the Texas Panhandle and over Hall County. This storm interacted with the "outflow boundary" left by the departing anticyclonic storm. The southeastward propagating storm rapidly became tornadic near the northwestern corner of Childress. Large hail, damaging RFD winds, and the significant (F2) tornado resulted in nearly $6 million in damages and injured one. A school net weather instrument located at the heavily damaged Childress High School measured a peak wind gust of 109 MPH as the tornado destroyed the school's gymnasium.A second round of isolated severe storms produced large hail over the extreme southeastern Texas Panhandle as clean-up crews worked in the damaged areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado resulted in significant (F2) damage along a one and half mile path through the north side of Childress during the evening hours of the 9th. The tornado developed in a residential are of northwest Childress at 20:30 CST. Damage in the neighborhood was characterized as weak, with numerous downed trees, street signs, and damaged roofs. A resident was injured when a tree fell and struck him, breaking his arm and causing minor lacerations.The tornado then moved east toward the high school. Damage to the high school was extensive. A local television network, KVII-TV in Amarillo, operates an automated weather station on the campus as part of a regional school net. The instrument measured a 109 MPH wind gust as the tornado ripped through the facility at 20:32 CST. Damage at Childress High School was rated F1, with large brick walls blown inn and portions of the building's roof removed. The gymnasium was declared a total loss.The tornado intensified as it continued to move east across Fair Park. A large industrial building used to house city owned emergency vehicles was completely destroyed, with extensive damage to the fleet of vehicles that were parked inside. A tennis court was destroyed by wind-blown debris, and numerous large trees were uprooted. A large stone picnic table was blown northward along the wind fields convergent axis associated with center of the tornado's path. A well-built metal bridge that spanned Park Lake was blown a considerable distance downwind. Damage along the tornado's path through the park justified a significant rating (F2) on the Fujita Tornado Damage Intensity Scale. This given the magnitude of damage observed at the industrial building site, where large steel beams were completely torn from their bolted fixtures.The damage survey indicated that the tornado quickly weakened as it continued to move east of the park, and into more rural areas in the northeastern outskirts of the city.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.7M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These storms evolved into splitting supercells, and resulted in large hail up to two inches in diameter in Dickens and Motley Counties. The anticyclonic member from one of the mentioned storms propagated northward over Childress County during the early evening hours. The storm effectively lowered temperature-to-dewpoint depressions and locally backed the near-surface winds. A classic supercell subsequently propagated southeastward out of the Texas Panhandle and over Hall County. This storm interacted with the "outflow boundary" left by the departing anticyclonic storm. The southeastward propagating storm rapidly became tornadic near the northwestern corner of Childress. Large hail, damaging RFD winds, and the significant (F2) tornado resulted in nearly $6 million in damages and injured one. A school net weather instrument located at the heavily damaged Childress High School measured a peak wind gust of 109 MPH as the tornado destroyed the school's gymnasium.A second round of isolated severe storms produced large hail over the extreme southeastern Texas Panhandle as clean-up crews worked in the damaged areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado resulted in significant (F2) damage along a one and half mile path through the north side of Childress during the evening hours of the 9th. The tornado developed in a residential are of northwest Childress at 20:30 CST. Damage in the neighborhood was characterized as weak, with numerous downed trees, street signs, and damaged roofs. A resident was injured when a tree fell and struck him, breaking his arm and causing minor lacerations.The tornado then moved east toward the high school. Damage to the high school was extensive. A local television network, KVII-TV in Amarillo, operates an automated weather station on the campus as part of a regional school net. The instrument measured a 109 MPH wind gust as the tornado ripped through the facility at 20:32 CST. Damage at Childress High School was rated F1, with large brick walls blown inn and portions of the building's roof removed. The gymnasium was declared a total loss.The tornado intensified as it continued to move east across Fair Park. A large industrial building used to house city owned emergency vehicles was completely destroyed, with extensive damage to the fleet of vehicles that were parked inside. A tennis court was destroyed by wind-blown debris, and numerous large trees were uprooted. A large stone picnic table was blown northward along the wind fields convergent axis associated with center of the tornado's path. A well-built metal bridge that spanned Park Lake was blown a considerable distance downwind. Damage along the tornado's path through the park justified a significant rating (F2) on the Fujita Tornado Damage Intensity Scale. This given the magnitude of damage observed at the industrial building site, where large steel beams were completely torn from their bolted fixtures.The damage survey indicated that the tornado quickly weakened as it continued to move east of the park, and into more rural areas in the northeastern outskirts of the city.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.7M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This path took it through the southeast corner of the University of Iowa campus.  This was the first tornado to hit near the campus in 35 years and the University was closed on Friday April 14th for safety reasons.The KIOW ASOS at the airport on the southwest side of the city recorded a peak wind gust of 49 knots (57 mph) at 1931 CST.  This gust was likely the result of the rear flank downdraft as the tornado neared the intersection of U.S. 6 and highway 1 northeast of the airport.  Hard times for the location of the tornado are 1930 CST at the Wal-Mart.  At 1932-1933 CST power was lost at the Johnson County Sheriff Office with telephone lines, LAN, and automated systems going down as the tornado passed over the building.  While the tornado was passing over the sheriff's office, someone flipped the outdoor warning sirens from automatic to manual override and activated the sirens one final time.Damage totals are still being evaluated and the $12 million amount will likely be closer to $15 million or possibly higher.  Known damage amounts include; Iowa City and Johnson County $4 million with an additional $755,000 of uninsured loses (traffic lights, signs, street lights), University of Iowa $6 million with the motor pool headquarters a total loss and 31 vehicles damaged, and $1.3 million in damage to residences/businesses.  Three automobile dealerships were damaged; one dealership had 200 vehicles damaged, a second had 60-70 vehicles damaged, and a third had nearly every vehicle sustaining some type of damage.A total of 1,016 residential and 35 commercial buildings were damaged with some destroyed.  Some well known landmark buildings known to citizens, college students, and alumni were lost or heavily damaged.  These included the Dairy Queen (lost) and St. Patrick's Church (heavily damaged).  Several historic buildings were damaged downtown and it is unknown whether or not they can or will be saved.  The tornado damaged the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house and damaged many student apartments located just off the campus on Iowa, Dodge, and Governor streets.Given the strength and width of the tornado it is amazing that only 30 injuries (many minor) occurred.  Many U of I students were unaware of what was happening or dashed to a nearby parking garage for safety with the tornado approaching a few blocks behind them.  Several foreign exchange students, many of whom had never seen, experienced, or heard of a tornado, were in awe and disbelief over the magnitude of the event.  At St. Patrick's Church, the Maundy Thursday evening service had just ended.  Upon being told of an approaching tornado by Decon Jerome Miller, the Reverend Rudolph Juarez ushered 50 to 75 parishioners (many elderly) to the safety of the rectory basement next door.  This action saved the lives of everyone as the tornado tore off the roof off the church and collapsed the top portion of the brick facade and the steeple into the main congregation area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Rated very high F2 with winds estimated at 155 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 12M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This path took it through the southeast corner of the University of Iowa campus.  This was the first tornado to hit near the campus in 35 years and the University was closed on Friday April 14th for safety reasons.The KIOW ASOS at the airport on the southwest side of the city recorded a peak wind gust of 49 knots (57 mph) at 1931 CST.  This gust was likely the result of the rear flank downdraft as the tornado neared the intersection of U.S. 6 and highway 1 northeast of the airport.  Hard times for the location of the tornado are 1930 CST at the Wal-Mart.  At 1932-1933 CST power was lost at the Johnson County Sheriff Office with telephone lines, LAN, and automated systems going down as the tornado passed over the building.  While the tornado was passing over the sheriff's office, someone flipped the outdoor warning sirens from automatic to manual override and activated the sirens one final time.Damage totals are still being evaluated and the $12 million amount will likely be closer to $15 million or possibly higher.  Known damage amounts include; Iowa City and Johnson County $4 million with an additional $755,000 of uninsured loses (traffic lights, signs, street lights), University of Iowa $6 million with the motor pool headquarters a total loss and 31 vehicles damaged, and $1.3 million in damage to residences/businesses.  Three automobile dealerships were damaged; one dealership had 200 vehicles damaged, a second had 60-70 vehicles damaged, and a third had nearly every vehicle sustaining some type of damage.A total of 1,016 residential and 35 commercial buildings were damaged with some destroyed.  Some well known landmark buildings known to citizens, college students, and alumni were lost or heavily damaged.  These included the Dairy Queen (lost) and St. Patrick's Church (heavily damaged).  Several historic buildings were damaged downtown and it is unknown whether or not they can or will be saved.  The tornado damaged the Alpha Chi Omega sorority house and damaged many student apartments located just off the campus on Iowa, Dodge, and Governor streets.Given the strength and width of the tornado it is amazing that only 30 injuries (many minor) occurred.  Many U of I students were unaware of what was happening or dashed to a nearby parking garage for safety with the tornado approaching a few blocks behind them.  Several foreign exchange students, many of whom had never seen, experienced, or heard of a tornado, were in awe and disbelief over the magnitude of the event.  At St. Patrick's Church, the Maundy Thursday evening service had just ended.  Upon being told of an approaching tornado by Decon Jerome Miller, the Reverend Rudolph Juarez ushered 50 to 75 parishioners (many elderly) to the safety of the rectory basement next door.  This action saved the lives of everyone as the tornado tore off the roof off the church and collapsed the top portion of the brick facade and the steeple into the main congregation area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Rated very high F2 with winds estimated at 155 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 12M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado began less than two miles from the Trigg County line with an east-southeast movement, then curved slightly left before crossing Highway 91. The tornado moved east-northeast across central Christian County, passing less than four miles north of downtown Hopkinsville, before crossing into Todd County less than a mile north of Pilot Rock. Near the beginning of the damage path, a church was levelled. Across the county, 91 homes were destroyed, and another 171 homes sustained varying degrees of damage. Several people were pulled from the debris of their homes during a door-to-door search that lasted into the next morning. Of the 22 people directly injured by the tornado, 17 were checked in at the local hospital, and five were transferred to regional hospitals. Another ten or so people received injuries not directly inflicted by the tornado, such as driving into fallen trees. None of the injuries, which consisted mostly of cuts, bruises, and fractures, were considered life-threatening. Numerous garages, barns, and outbuildings were destroyed. Some vehicles were damaged or destroyed. Hundreds of trees were downed, snapped, or uprooted. Power was out to most of the city of Hopkinsville for about six hours as a result of downed steel towers that carry primary transmission lines. Peak winds were estimated near 185 MPH. The average path width was 500 yards. It should be noted that the initial tornado reformed or reorganized about 7 miles northeast of Hopkinsville, leaving a break in the tornado path less than a mile long. Downburst wind damage occurred both north and south of the area where the tornado reorganized, resulting in a two-mile wide swath of damage along Highway 107.

The damage path was about 50 yards wide with a damage intensity of F0.  As it approached the Fredericktown Municipal Airport, along Copper Mines Road, it began to produce multiple vortices.  Two tornadic damage tracks were uncovered across a lake west of Highway OO along County Roads 271 and 272.  Over 20 homes, mobile homes and machine sheds sustained varying degrees of damage.  Several witnesses observed twin tornadoes merging into one large tornado over this area.  The width of the damage path of the northern track was approximately 150 yards wide while the southern damage path was about 100 yards wide.  The damage intensity ranged from F1 to F2 in this location.  As the large tornado crossed Highway OO, five homes, four mobile homes and several machine sheds sustained varying degrees of damage.  The damage path was 300 yards wide and high end F1 intensity.  The tornado continued east along County Road 217.  Four homes sustained F1 to F2 damage with debris from two of the homes thrown between 50 to 100 yards to the east.  Also, numerous trees were either snapped or uprooted in this area.  The width of the damage path in this area was about 250 yards.  Further east, two tornadic damage tracks were uncovered about half a mile to a mile north of the intersection of County Roads 215 and 217.  Four homes sustained varying degrees of damage while one mobile home was completely destroyed.  One person was critically injured near the destroyed mobile home.  Debris from the mobile home was tossed over 150 yards to the east.  The width of the northern damage path was about 150 yards, while the width of the southern track was about 50 yards.  The damage was rated high end F1 in this location.  Witnesses observed the twin tornadoes merge again into one large funnel as it crossed a second small lake north of County Road 217.  Four homes and several machine sheds sustained damage.  Also, over a thousand trees around the lake were snapped or uprooted.  The damage path was a quarter of a mile wide in this location and was rated F1 to low end F2.  The tornado continued eastward into northeast Madison County crossing County Road 219 just south of the Madison/St. Francois County line.  Three homes were damaged and three machine sheds were destroyed, as well as thousands of trees snapped or uprooted.  The width of the damage path in this area was half a mile and was rated F2.

Along the Perry County portion of the tornado track, 62 homes were destroyed, 17 had major damage, and 23 received minor damage. Ten of the destroyed homes were mobile homes, and seven that sustained major damage were mobile homes. Three churches were destroyed or heavily damaged. Numerous vehicles were tossed. Over 100 utility poles were broken off. Hundreds of trees were broken off or uprooted. The tornado first touched down at County Road 302 near Friedenburg, where F-1 winds destroyed a barn and partially unroofed a two-story house. There were also downed trees, including a few that fell on a house. As the tornado continued northeast across County Road 316 between Crosstown and Friedenburg, it widened to about 100 yards. Scores of trees were broken off or uprooted, and the roof was blown off a house. The tornado strengthened to F-3 intensity as it reached the junction of Highways P and C in Crosstown. The roof was torn off a church, windows were broken, and other structural damage occurred. Nearby, the roof was blown off a two-story brick store that was over 100 years old. An overturned vehicle was in the front yard, and trees were mangled. The width increased to 220 yards. In the center of Crosstown on Highway C, the tornado reached F-4 intensity. This is where a site-built house was levelled. The F-4 damage continued east along County Road 350 in Crosstown, where two more site-built houses were levelled. Only the bolted-down floor of one residence remained. An eyewitness along County Road 350 stated he took shelter in the basement after seeing fog coming directly toward him. His house remained mostly intact, except for the roof and garage. The tornado weakened to F-3 intensity about one to two miles east of Crosstown, where a modular home was destroyed except for the bathroom. A vehicle was tossed in the yard. The weakening trend continued east along County Road 350 to the Mississippi River, where many trees were uprooted and broken off. Some outbuildings were thrown around. The path width decreased to 75 yards as the intensity lowered to F-1. The average path width was 150 yards. There were five injuries requiring medical attention, including one broken arm. Two people were moderately injured when the vehicle they were driving was tossed into a house. Dozens of other residents received minor injuries but did not seek medical attention. Where the tornado crossed the Mississippi River, a barge loaded with coal was pushed to the shoreline. The windows were blown out of the tug boat, and enough coal was blown into the tug boat that it was shovelled out. The tornado crossed the Mississippi River into Jackson County, Illinois.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Along the Perry County portion of the tornado track, 62 homes were destroyed, 17 had major damage, and 23 received minor damage. Ten of the destroyed homes were mobile homes, and seven that sustained major damage were mobile homes. Three churches were destroyed or heavily damaged. Numerous vehicles were tossed. Over 100 utility poles were broken off. Hundreds of trees were broken off or uprooted. The tornado first touched down at County Road 302 near Friedenburg, where F-1 winds destroyed a barn and partially unroofed a two-story house. There were also downed trees, including a few that fell on a house. As the tornado continued northeast across County Road 316 between Crosstown and Friedenburg, it widened to about 100 yards. Scores of trees were broken off or uprooted, and the roof was blown off a house. The tornado strengthened to F-3 intensity as it reached the junction of Highways P and C in Crosstown. The roof was torn off a church, windows were broken, and other structural damage occurred. Nearby, the roof was blown off a two-story brick store that was over 100 years old. An overturned vehicle was in the front yard, and trees were mangled. The width increased to 220 yards. In the center of Crosstown on Highway C, the tornado reached F-4 intensity. This is where a site-built house was levelled. The F-4 damage continued east along County Road 350 in Crosstown, where two more site-built houses were levelled. Only the bolted-down floor of one residence remained. An eyewitness along County Road 350 stated he took shelter in the basement after seeing fog coming directly toward him. His house remained mostly intact, except for the roof and garage. The tornado weakened to F-3 intensity about one to two miles east of Crosstown, where a modular home was destroyed except for the bathroom. A vehicle was tossed in the yard. The weakening trend continued east along County Road 350 to the Mississippi River, where many trees were uprooted and broken off. Some outbuildings were thrown around. The path width decreased to 75 yards as the intensity lowered to F-1. The average path width was 150 yards. There were five injuries requiring medical attention, including one broken arm. Two people were moderately injured when the vehicle they were driving was tossed into a house. Dozens of other residents received minor injuries but did not seek medical attention. Where the tornado crossed the Mississippi River, a barge loaded with coal was pushed to the shoreline. The windows were blown out of the tug boat, and enough coal was blown into the tug boat that it was shovelled out. The tornado crossed the Mississippi River into Jackson County, Illinois.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado weakened from its maximum F-4 intensity to F-2 intensity by the time it entered Jackson County in the Mississippi River bottomlands near Wilkinson Island. At this location, the wall of an old two-story farmhouse was blown out, and the roof was blown off. Hundreds of trees were broken off. Tree damage was visible across the river in Perry County, Missouri. The path width was estimated to be 200 yards wide on the Jackson County side of the river.

Nearby, a house was unroofed, and trees were snapped or uprooted. Another house lost a room that was added on. A swing set was blown 200 yards and wrapped around a mailbox. An empty tractor trailer rig was overturned. An empty grain bin was blown 100 yards into a field. Full grain bins were severely damaged but remained in place. The roof was blown off a brick house. As the tornado crossed Route 3, high tension utility poles were snapped off, hundreds of acres of corn were flattened, and trees were uprooted. Route 3 was closed for nine hours. From Route 3, the tornado proceeded east-northeast through mostly rural areas of the county, including the Kinkaid Lake State Wildlife Area. The tornado weakened to F-0 intensity before reaching Kinkaid Lake. At the Kinkaid Lake marina, about 50 RV's and boats were damaged, and trees were broken off. The tornado finally lifted shortly after crossing Highway 127 north of Murphysboro. The damage along Highway 127 was about 75 yards wide and consisted of broken tree limbs. A state trooper videotaped the tornado before it lifted. Storm chasers also videotaped the tornado. Peak winds where F-2 damage occurred in western Jackson County were estimated near 150 MPH. The average path width was about 150 yards. A total of about six homes were destroyed or severely damaged, and a dozen others were damaged to a lesser degree. Dozens of other non-residential buildings, such as garages, sheds, barns, and carports, were destroyed. Along the path, striations were evident in fields, and scores of utility poles were snapped off. There were numerous reports of debris falling from the sky in neighboring Perry County, Illinois.

The tornado killed 10 head of cattle at one farmstead just south of Wolsey. The tornado snapped off numerous power poles, caused widespread tree damage, and severely damaged a bridge where it crossed U.S. Highway 14. The tornado also caused crop damage, but the amount of crop damage was not known.

This strong weather system developed as a very strong jet stream, with winds between 160-200 mph, slammed into Oregon and Washington State. All that energy moved over the Rocky Mountains and caused a strong area of surface low pressure to develop. This low intensified as it moved east across the Red River Valley and then lifted across Arkansas and into Tennessee as it deepened to 990 mb! The strength of this deepening low caused warm and unstable air to lift northward across Louisiana and into central Mississippi. It was this northward moving warm front that became the focus of an area where tornadic supercell thunderstorms could thrive in an unstable and highly sheared environment.|This large and powerful storm system produced numerous tornadoes across the south and south eastern United States where many were of the strong (F2 or F3) variety. Within the Jackson, MS forecast area, there were a total of 5 tornadoes to impact the counties serviced. Two F3s, one in Lamar County and the other in Jones County. The Jones County tornado actually contained a satellite tornado, F1, which briefly rotated around the parent tornado. Next was an F1 tornado in southern Marion County which was actually the end of a strong tornado that moved out of Walthall County. Lastly, a brief F1 tornado occurred in central Lamar County. Tornadoes were not the only type of severe weather, scattered wind damage also occurred across northeast Louisiana and portions of central Mississippi between midnight and 10 am Wednesday November 15th 2006.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This strong tornado touched down near the Glade and Tuckers Crossing Communities and tracked east northeast to near the Mill Creek Community before entering Wayne County near Highway 84. Around 25 homes suffered significant damage. The most intense damage was along a path from near the intersection of Highway 15 and Orange Drive northeast to the area along Township Road. Two metal high tension electric power truss towers were destroyed, hundreds of trees were snapped and uprooted, at least two mobile homes were destroyed, a travel trailer being used for post-Katrina housing was annihilated, and several houses suffered significant structural damage. Northeast of this area, the path continued all the way to the county line with Wayne County, but damage was generally less, F0 to occasionally F1, and limited to tree damage. The one exception was near the Mill Creek community, where a storage building was destroyed and a couple of homes suffered roof damage. Total path length across Jones and Wayne Counties was 17 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.70M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This strong weather system developed as a very strong jet stream, with winds between 160-200 mph, slammed into Oregon and Washington State. All that energy moved over the Rocky Mountains and caused a strong area of surface low pressure to develop. This low intensified as it moved east across the Red River Valley and then lifted across Arkansas and into Tennessee as it deepened to 990 mb! The strength of this deepening low caused warm and unstable air to lift northward across Louisiana and into central Mississippi. It was this northward moving warm front that became the focus of an area where tornadic supercell thunderstorms could thrive in an unstable and highly sheared environment.|This large and powerful storm system produced numerous tornadoes across the south and south eastern United States where many were of the strong (F2 or F3) variety. Within the Jackson, MS forecast area, there were a total of 5 tornadoes to impact the counties serviced. Two F3s, one in Lamar County and the other in Jones County. The Jones County tornado actually contained a satellite tornado, F1, which briefly rotated around the parent tornado. Next was an F1 tornado in southern Marion County which was actually the end of a strong tornado that moved out of Walthall County. Lastly, a brief F1 tornado occurred in central Lamar County. Tornadoes were not the only type of severe weather, scattered wind damage also occurred across northeast Louisiana and portions of central Mississippi between midnight and 10 am Wednesday November 15th 2006.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This strong tornado touched down to the southwest of Sumrall and tracked east northeast across northern Lamar County and then into a small portion of extreme northwest Forrest County before dissipating. Approximately 25 homes were damaged, 16 of those suffering major damage or total destruction. The worst damage was along Old Salt Road, where a wood frame home on a concrete block foundation was totally destroyed, with the foundation cleared and the remnants of the home displaced dozens of yards away. A minivan was picked up and thrown/rolled a distance of approximately 150 yards, landing on top of a tractor and totally destroyed. Some large trees at this location were snapped at the base, denuded, and partially debarked. Heavy damage of F2 intensity was also observed along Foster Road, JD Hatten Road, and Rocky Branch road. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted, and a few frame homes totally lost their roofs. Other damage along the path was weaker and generally of F1 intensity. The tornado then crossed Highway 42 and entered extreme northwest Forrest County.

There was significant roof damage as well. An 8000 pound air conditioning unit was toppled on the roof of this grocery store. A roof was lifted off of a well built home approximately a quarter mile to the east northeast of the grocery store.  Thousands of trees were blown down and uprooted along the path of this tornado. Shingle and roof damage was common along the entire path of this tornado too. Over 100 homes sustained at least minor damage. Two trailer homes and a construction trailer were completely destroyed. There was also minor damage to a high school in Fairview Heights. A roof was blown off the fire department in Dorrance.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Numerous trees were snapped off or downed along the path with minor roof damage to numerous homes. Near the Atlanta Highway, the tornado crossed the A.U.M. ball field complex and struck the Montgomery Postal Processing and Distribution Center and Post Office. The main doors of the post office were blown in and portions of the roof were lifted off to the north. Numerous trees were snapped off at ground level on the south and west sides of the building. A tractor trailer was completely turned around and moved 30 yards and flipped over. Other postal vehicles and cars in the parking lot were moved or received significant damage. Just to the north, the tornado produced major damage to the Fun Zone Skating Rink. This was a large metal building structure which was nearly totally destroyed. Several vehicles were tossed around and significantly damaged or crushed by debris from the building. As the tornado crossed the Atlanta Highway, several metal power poles were either significantly bent or downed. At the Saddleback Ridge Apartment Complex, at least two apartment buildings lost their roofs and portions of the second floor. The tornado continued another 2.25 miles northeastward, ending in a field just south of Wares Ferry Road.

The tornado crossed just across the border into Muscogee county before lifting.  Moderate damage was observed within the Main Post area of Fort Benning along a 150-yard wide, 1.5-mile long path.

Between 8 and more than 11 inches of rain fell in roughly a five hour period in a five mile wide stripe extending from Madeira Beach northeast through Pinellas Park, then across Old Tampa Bay to west Tampa, including Tampa International Airport. The area of heaviest rain was so concentrated that downtown St. Petersburg, less than 10 miles away, recorded less than an inch of rain during the same period.  The torrential rains caused flash flooding in the areas where more than 8 inches fell. The flash flooding prompted the mayor of St. Petersburg to term the event a "hundred year flood".  In Lealman, an entire mobile home community was evacuated, and at least 60 of the homes were flooded. A partial roof collapse was reported at a big box store in St. Petersburg.  Water pouring into the store washed out several cash register stands and injured one employee as they were washed into the parking lot.  Another roof collapsed at Treasure Island. Hundreds of vehicles were stranded by the flood waters.

A large fetch of Gulf and Atlantic moisture was pulled northward ahead of the cold front, which produced a squall line of thunderstorms with very heavy rainfall. This line of thunderstorms produced 45 to 74 mph winds across a large part of central NY. Additionally, the squall line spawned an F1 tornado north of Elmira, NY. As the squall line moved east, late in the afternoon of the 16th, it slowed down and stalled for a time. Areas from Owego and Binghamton, NY, north and east through Ithaca, Cortland and Norwich, NY, to Oneida county in the western Mohawk Valley and the northern Catskills saw the brunt of the heavy rainfall from this slow moving line of storms. 1.5 to 4 inches of rain fell in just 3 hours causing significant flash flooding over many of these areas. Many hillsides and creeks turned into raging torrents, causing mudslides and debris flows that cascaded into more populated valley areas. In the urban valley regions, the flash flood reports were numerous with road washouts, highway closings, and some parking lots that were entirely flooded, ruining many cars. A mudslide on Interstate 88 outside of Port Crane, NY caused a multi-car pile up. The flash flooding evolved into a minor to moderate river flood event mainly on the Susquehanna River and its tributaries in New York from Thursday night the 16th until Saturday the 18th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A mud slide on interstate 88 resulted in a multi-injury car accident.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The storm initially brought one to two inches of heavy rainfall to parts of western Washington on the 14th, producing areas of urban and small stream flooding and overwhelming drainage systems.  Widespread strong damaging winds followed, impacting the entire state as the storm center tracked from well off the coast east across the region near the British Columbia border. |In western Washington, peak winds reached 80 to 90 mph along the coast and elsewhere 60 to 75 mph.  A few locations had gusts as high 85 mph in the interior. Mountain areas recorded peak wind speeds reached in excess of 100 mph, including 113 mph at Chinook Pass and 100 mph at Sunrise in Mt Rainier National Park.|The wind storm, the strongest since the 1993 Inauguration Day Wind Storm, blew down thousands of trees and knocked power out to close to 1.5 million customers in western Washington.  The strong winds damaged major transmission lines, power poles and other power utility infrastructure. Trees also fell onto houses, street signs, street lights, parked cars, fences, railings and rooftops. |There were four fatalities as a direct result of the storm and eleven indirect fatalities following the storm from carbon monoxide poisoning, encountering downed power lines and a candle started house fire. Three people in western Washington were killed by fallen trees and one person drowned in Seattle when their basement filled with rain runoff. Eight of the indirect fatalities were from carbon monoxide poisoning and another 275 people were treated from the poisoning in King county alone. Two people were electrocuted by downed power lines and one man died after his home burned apparently started by a candle used for light.  36 people were directly injured by the wind storm.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> In the Madison Valley area of Seattle, heavy rainfall produced excessive street runoff, flooding about 25 basements and drowning one woman trapped in her basement by rapidly rising water.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 750.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Intense thunderstorms fired along and ahead of a cold front working down from the northern Great Lakes and eventually developed into a large MCS by mid evening. The Tri Cities and thumb regions were especially hard hit during this event. Several microbursts actually produced 100 MPH wind gusts across northeast Huron county, causing quite a bit of damage. The outflow created from the storms across the north actually held together long enough to spread south. There were several reports of trees blown down in areas south of M-59, although the damage was minimal when compared to the destruction across the northern parts of the area. Very few reports of hail were received, however, golf ball size hail was reported in Saginaw County. This event caused one death and one injury in Wayne County. A couple was struck by lightning after seeking refuge under a tree.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A couple was struck by lightning after taking shelter from the rain under a tree at 2301 EST in Krainz Park near East Hildale and Justine on Detroit's east side. The pair was taken to Detroit Receiving Hospital, where the 44 year old woman was later pronounced dead.

They noted widespread damage to trees and vegetation beginning near that point and continuing northward to the San Marcos Tanger Outlet Mall and Prime Time Outlet Mall.  The damage was caused by a combination of large hail and winds gusting 40 to 50 mph.  NWS NEXRAD Radar late Thursday afternoon had indicated severe thunderstorms in that area moving toward the northeast.At the south end of the Malls, the parking lot surface was covered with dents and impressions produced by the wind and hail. Hundreds of vehicles had been damaged in this event but only a few remained in the area.  Most of these had all of the window glass broken out with hundreds of hail dents in the car bodies.  At this part of the Malls, damage to store signs was seen only on the north and west sides of buildings.  There was no damage to signs on the south and east sides.  Therefore, the storm winds had propelled the hail toward the southeast.  In addition to the sign damage, hundreds of roof tiles had been broken and cracked, and many of these had fallen into the parking lot during the storm.As the team drove northward through the Mall areas, the same type of damage to building signs and roofs as well as parking surfaces was seen.  However, at the north end of the Malls, damage to the store signs was confined to the south and west walls of the buildings.  In this part of the Malls, the damaging winds had propelled the hail toward the northeast.  Thus, the pattern of damage was fan-shaped, with the winds generally blowing the hail toward the west, but with a southeast component of motion on the south end of the Malls and a northeast component of motion on the north end of the Malls.  This type of damage is clearly indicative of straight-line winds, also referred to as "downburst winds."  One of the NWS staff members was at the Malls during the storm.  Dents in his vehicle were 4.25 inches in diameter, indicating that at some of the hail stones were as large as grapefruits.  He had estimated windspeeds to be between 60 and 70 mph.The team drove roads in all directions from the Mall areas and concluded that the severe wind and hail had caused the worst damage in an area enclosed by Wonder World Drive, Posey Road, Hunter Road, and FM266 which is also known as Old Bastrop Highway.  Other areas of large hail and damaging winds were reported to the NWS, but the level of damage was generally more isolated and less severe.Damages from this storm were estimated at $100M with up to 10,000 vehicles damaged and another 7000 vehicles in homes in the area.  Losses to businesses as a result of closing the following day were estimated at $500,000.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A cold front extended from northwest Minnesota into central Kansas.  The cold front moved into the northwest corner of Iowa by the mid afternoon hours.  Surface CAPE values were quite high at 3500 to 5500 J/kg, however there was very little 0-3 km shear.  Shear values were under 10 kts.  Afternoon high temperatures reached the mid 80s to mid 90s.  These temperatures, combined with dew point readings around 70, produced lifted indices in the -8 to -11 C. range.  Convection was limited by convection that had occurred during the morning to the south of Iowa.  The outflow boundary moved into the area, tending to stabilize the airmass somewhat for the afternoon hours.  Thunderstorms that did develop tended to produce hail.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the sounding were in the 400 to 700 J/kg range.  These values were quite high, but were countered by the high freezing levels.  Mid afternoon freezing levels were between 13,500 and 14500 feet.  The lower part of the sounding was quite dry, and as a result the LCL value was between 7000 to 8000 feet, significantly reducing the tornado threat.
