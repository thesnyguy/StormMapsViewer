The storm reorganized with the storm-relative inflow favoring the north side of the storm.  As the storm moved into the Big Spring area the it became a left-split supercell with the velocity display from the KMAF WSR-88D showing a well-developed anti-cyclonically rotating mesocyclone.  The storm moved over the eastern half of the city from the south.  In southern Big Spring baseball size hail fell while over the northeastern and eastern parts of the city softball size hail was reported.  Graduation ceremony was ready to commence when softball hail struck Howard College.  Skylights on the coliseum roof were shattered sending glass falling onto the floor that would have been filled with candidates just a few minutes later.  The largest hail was reported at the intersection of I-20 and Business I-20 as the storm exited the city to the northeast.  A Boy Scout caravan of 5 vehicles was pummelled by 5 inch diameter hail.  The hail knocked out every window in every vehicle.Injuries from the storm included many cuts from broken glass and from direct strikes by jagged hailstones.  One hailstone broke the side window of a car and continued with enough force to break a woman's arm inside the car.   About 2000 residential roofs were replaced with many of these roofs less than a year old due to the April 3, 1995 hail storm.  The Big Spring storm then moved northeast to the Vincent community where softball hail was once again reported.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This storm had a continuous track of damaging winds and hail for 33 miles.  This track could have been longer, but in this desolate area, no other reports were available.  Although there was F1 scale damage, there were no confirmed tornado sightings.  Most of the significant damage was thought to have come from Rear-flank downdrafts, due to the location to the proximity of the large hail.  The storm was moving to the ESE at 45-50 mph, so forward-flank downdrafts could have caused some of the damage as well due to the summation of outflow speed and translational speed.  Along Highway 118 the fringe-to-fringe damage path was 8 miles wide--also suggesting large-scale outflow was a contributor to the damage.An unobstructed view from the northeast allowed people in the Midland/Odessa area to see the upper half of the storm from about 200 miles away just before sunset.  The storm tower showed strong signs of rotation (in the form of large bands) even from this distance.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> North of where the RFD winds caused damage, hail up to softball size smashed car windshields and pummelled a couple of houses.  One gentleman, who was attempting to close a window, was injured when hail broke the window and caused several facial lacerations.  He was taken  by private vehicle to the Alpine Hospital.  A second man suffered minor cuts on his legs.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Strong to severe thunderstorms developed rapidly in northern Maryland and tracked east-southeast into east-central and lower southern Maryland during the early evening.  The main culprits for damage were gusty winds and lightning, through a few occurrences of large hail were noted.Initial thunderstorms produced large hail in central Baltimore and northern Carroll Cos during the mid afternoon.  The real action began during the early evening commuting hours, when a severe thunderstorm knocked down numerous trees and large limbs on an east-southeast trek from Reisterstown to Essex.  The same cell produced wind-driven hail which broke windows of several automobiles in Reisterstown.  The flying glass shards injured one occupant of a vehicle; the shards had to be removed from his scalp.  Other wind damage was noted across southern Carroll Co and central Montgomery Co.The final round of storms fired during the mid-evening, producing damaging wind gusts (mainly trees and power lines), first in northern and eastern Anne Arundel Co.  Other storms developed over lower southern Maryland, producing tree and wire damage in St Mary's and Calvert Cos.Lightning was a major factor with the storms.  A lightning death occurred in southwest Baltimore City at 1730EST when two youngsters were running home to escape the storm.  They made it to the shelter of a large tree, which was struck.  The attendant current burned over half of the deceased's (a nine-year old girl) body.   Her 8 year-old friend survived with lesser burns.  Farther south, a small house fire was ignited by a lightning strike in Arnold.  Power outages of at least 33,000 Southern Maryland Electric Co. customers were directly attributed to a lightning strike at a supply station in St Mary's Co.  In all, at least 50,000 Maryland residents west of the Chesapeake Bay lost electricity during the outbreak of storms.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornadoes were spawned by a single storm between 6 and 715 pm CST in Pottawatomie and Seminole Counties. The first tornado (an F1) touched down 3.5 miles west-southwest of Maud in Pottawatomie County, moved east into Seminole County, lifting about 11 miles west-southwest of Wewoka. The second tornado (rated F2) touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Wewoka in Seminole County, moved east through Wewoka, and crossed into Hughes County.  Meanwhile, the third tornado (also an F2) developed about 4.5 miles west-southwest of Yeager in Hughes County. These two tornadoes then merged about 3.5 miles southwest of Yeager and continued east until they lifted 4 miles east of Yeager.   This tornadic thunderstorm also produced hail as large as softballs southwest of Seminole in Seminole County. Baseball sized hail was reported with a different storm in Oklahoma City in Oklahoma County.  Widespread hail and wind damage occurred in Ponca City in Kay County and in Norman in Cleveland County.Wind gusts were estimated as high as 70 mph near Wellston and Warwick in Lincoln County. Significant thunderstorm wind damage occurred throughout Lincoln County, in Purcell in McClain County, and near Calumet and El Reno in Canadian County.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A man and an elderly woman were injured when they were caught outside in the hailstorm.

The most severe weather occurred along a corridor roughly along and 40 miles to the south of US 380 from west of Throckmorton in Throckmorton County eastward to Greenville in Hunt County.  Occasionally propagating in a train echo fashion, these storms were efficient hail and wind producers.  Wise County was hardest hit by severe weather on the 8th, with wind, hail, and one confirmed tornado destroying 15 houses and damaging 178 others.  Widespread damage to automobiles and trees also were reported.  In Denton County, thunderstorm winds blew down powerlines across Interstate 35-E near Lake Dallas, closing both northbound and southbound lanes of traffic.  In the ensuing traffic jam, motorists were stranded in their vehicles as another severe thunderstorm moved across the area.

In spite of the instability, the atmosphere was capped by very warm air aloft.  Temperatures at the 700 mb level were between 12 degrees C and 14 degrees C.  As a result, thunderstorms had a difficult time forming.  The atmosphere was primed with CAPE values in the 4000 to 6000 J/kg range by late morning.  Helicity values were near 300 M2/S2.  One cell was able to break the cap and became severe.  It was a prolific hail producer as well as spawning several tornadoes.  Hail reports indicated frequent baseball size hail with a few reports to softball size and larger.  The largest report was an incredible 5 inch diameter stone north of Gilbert in Story County.  The damage caused was incredible.  In some town, every north facing window was broken out by the hail.  On one building, the hail was so large that it broke the stone tile roof in the building, smashing it into pieces.  Property damage was extensive in a swath from Sac County through Marshall County.  Total property damage was estimated to be well in excess of $5,000,000.  In Calhoun County, the town of Lohrville was hard hit by baseball size hail.  Damage in the town was estimated at $1 million as the hail knocked out windows in almost all of the 225 buildings in town.  One injury was reported in Lohrville as a woman was treated for an eye injury as shards of glass flew into her eye from a car windshield broken by the hail.  Crop damage was difficult to assess, but was extensive.  Thousands of acres of crops were shredded by the hail.  In Webster County, estimates of crop damage indicated 24,000+ acres had total crop loss and 20,000+ acres suffered 30-50% loss.  Crop loss in the county was expected to be over $14 million.  In addition to the crop loss, property loss was estimated at between $2 and $4 million.  Many emergency managers described the hail event as the worst in 25 years in some areas to the worst they have ever seen in others.  To give some idea of the severity, the hail was large enough to shatter tile roofs.  Scenes of broken tiles falling off of houses were common.  The hail also took a toll on wildlife.  Numerous Pheasants, rabbits, and other small animals were killed by the hail, not to mention the smashed birds eggs.  The thunderstorm cell itself was a classic cell on WSR-88D radar.  It contained a clear hook echo and bounded weak echo region.  In spite of the structure looking text book perfect, the cell had a hard time producing a tornado.  Several brief touchdowns were reported from northwest of Boone to the vicinity of Boone.  The cell became better organized as it moved into central Iowa.  A tornado touched down in Story County and moved into Marshall County.  This tornado was fairly small and had a very intermittent track.  Storm chasers indicated that the tornado lifted several times during its life.  Damage was limited as the tornado tracked totally across open country and caused only crop damage for the most part.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A particularly severe thunderstorm affected Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita County, causing extensive damage to many of the buildings and an aircraft. Two soldiers were also injured by large hail.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Hail larger than golf balls, combined with severe thunderstorm winds up to 79 mph, caused extensive damage and 2 injuries at Sheppard Air Force Base.  The 2 injuries occurred when some soldiers were caught outside in the hailstorm.  48 (out of a squadron of 200) T-37 training jets were damaged by 2-inch hail.  The winds blew the protective covers from the planes and the hail then knocked holes in the wings and broke the planes' windshields.  Over 100 cars on the base were damaged. A window was knocked out of the air traffic control tower.  One house sustained heavy damage when all of its west-facing shutters were destroyed and  3 skylights and 2 windows were broken.

The thunderstorms evolved into a squall line as they moved across southeast Michigan.  Instability was high on this warm and humid summer day, allowing many of the storms to become severe.Unlike the previous day, severe reports were almost evenly split between large hail and damaging wind.  Most of the damaging wind gusts took down trees, tree limbs, utility poles, and power lines.  However, the marine community felt the brunt of the severe thunderstorm winds in two separate incidents.  A large number of sailboats were returning to the Bay City Yacht Club after a competition on Saginaw Bay, when the line of storms struck.  As many as a dozen boats were capsized, with two sailboats demasted.  On Lake St Clair, wind gusts capsized one sailboat, and caused a cabin cruiser to run aground.The largest hail of the day, golfball sized, was reported in Kawkawlin, Bay City, Zilwaukee, and Southfield.  In Bay City, the large hail fell on the exposed mariners (see above), causing welts and bruises to at least two.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The largest severe thunderstorm developed in Sequoyah County Oklahoma and then strengthened as it moved across Crawford and Franklin Counties along Interstate 40.  Along the way, this storm produced giant hail as large as baseballs and softballs.  This storm demonstrated strong rotation, producing a brief tornado touchdown just west of Alma and considerable damage from softball-sized hail in Alma.  A second weaker, though severe, thunderstorm formed over southern Crawford County and followed the same path as the first storm.  Finally, a severe thunderstorm moved out of northeast Oklahoma and clipped northwest Benton County, producing marginally severe hail.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> There were several reports of extremely large hail from Alma. The largest report was of giant softball-sized hail, while there were also reports of quarter and golfball-sized hail just north of Alma.Such enormous hail caused widespread damage in Alma.  Many cars sustained windshield and body damage.  Just one auto body shop reported that it had written estimates from hail damage totaling $140,000.  Many roofs also sustained major damage.  At the Eagle Crest Golf Course, the hail left small craters on the greens, closing the course for several days while the crater marks were filled.  A photo in the Alma Journal newspaper showed a softball-sized pock mark on the golf greens.A child was treated for injuries at a local hospital after being struck by the hail.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 800K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Additional roof and tree damage occurred in Monticello neighborhood of River Oaks. A number of businesses were then damaged or destroyed near the intersection of Camp Bowie and West Seventh (620 PM). Tornado moved east along West Seventh Street, striking the Montgomery Ward building and the adjacent Linwood neighborhood, doing extensive damage to older homes (622 PM). The tornado then did extensive damage to the six story Cash America building, nearly destroying it. Further significant damage was then done to the Mallick Tower building and Calvary Cathedral Building (624 PM). The tornado weakened as it entered downtown, but wind borne debris broke thousands of windows in buildings and high rises (626 PM). Particularly hard hit was the Bank One Building, which had 80% (3,000) of its windows broken, and the Union Pacific Resources Building (1,300 of 5,000 windows broken). Numerous other structures were affected to a lesser degree. Automobiles in streets and parking lots were also damaged. The tornado then dissipated as it moved east of downtown, although scattered minor damage occurred to roofs, trees, fences, and billboards about 3 miles east of the city near I-30 and Brentwood Stair. 	Two people were killed as a direct result of the tornado. A man (age 52) was killed while trying to reach shelter after warning others of the tornado, while a homeless man (age 67) was killed by a wall that collapsed on him. Some 80 other people were injured, but only six required hospitalization. Hail did extensive damage to roofs and autos mainly in Lake Worth and Saginaw. 	Initial tornado damage in Arlington occurred at a restaurant on South Cooper street. The tornado moved east and gained strength, doing F3 damage near Bardin and Matlock (707 PM), south of I-20. The tornado then struck the northern part of Arlington Airport (F2). The tornado paralled I-20, crossing the Interstate about one mile west of Highway 360, overturning at least one 18-wheeler (F1)(712 PM). The tornado then began moving northeast, ending with F2 damage to subdivision just northeast of Grand Prairie airport (near Arkansas and Parkside)(720 PM). In spite of the damage, there were no deaths or serious injuries in Arlington or Grand Prairie.	One commercial building was destroyed in Arlington, and 22 others damaged.

The storm produced a prolific path of large hail, a brief tornado, and a significant wet microburst across central and east central Wisconsin.  The storm was one of the most damaging thunderstorms in Wisconsin history, producing well over $100 million in damage.The thunderstorm developed north of a warm front, which was located across the Wisconsin/Illinois border.  The setup was favorable for what is known as "elevated" convection; that is, the source of the instability was aloft, and not surface-based.  Elevated convection often produces large hail, and the May 12 storm was no exception.As the storm moved into central Wisconsin, numerous reports of large hail were received from Waushara and Winnebago counties.  Baseball size hail was observed with the storm in Waushara county, two miles east of Coloma and in Dakota.  Hail damaged many of the roofs of the more than 1,000 homes in Omro (Winnebago co.) alone.As the storm intensified, it produced extensive damage across Calumet and Manitowoc counties as microburst winds developed.  Wind-driven hail shredded west-facing sides of homes and businesses that were caught in the path of the storm.The worst damage in Calumet county was in and around Chilton, where 2 inch hail and hurricane-force wind gusts (estimated near 80 mph) knocked holes in siding and tore the walls and roofs from some buildings.  Over 1000 homes were damaged in the city of Chilton.  Two hundred more sustained damage in the township of Charlestown.A brief tornado occurred as the storm entered Manitowoc county, but did no damage.  At about 1150 a.m. CDT, microburst winds near 100 mph and 2 inch hail combined to produce very serious damage in St. Nazianz.  Most of the homes in a mobile home park in St. Nazianz were overturned or knocked off their foundation by the straight-line wind.  Thirty people were injured in Manitowoc county, most in St. Nazianz.    In Manitowoc county, over 100 homes were destroyed by the combination of wind and hail.  Many more were damaged.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 46M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The damage began on the southwest side of the city with reports (including ham radio, media, and spotters) of large hail and wind gusts estimated over 80 mph.  The largest hail size was estimated at 4 1/2 inches, which caused extensive damage over $6 million to more than 2000 homes, mainly roof and siding damage.The hail and wind blew out many windows,  injuring one person with flying glass. The storm knocked out power to over 20,000 residences. Damage to vehicles was even more costly. Several automobile dealerships sustained major damage to nearly every car in their lots...totaling around 1000 vehicles. One man was injured in his vehicle when a hailstone crashed through his windshield, causing facial lacerations. In addition, the storm produced flash flooding, with many streets rendered temporarily impassable.  A National Weather Service damage assessment reported dozens of trees damaged and snapped...was concluded to be due to straight-line winds and hail, not a tornado.  An automated weather observation station at the Florence airport,  just east of the city, recorded a peak wind of 59 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was the third round of severe thunderstorms to strike southern Wisconsin due to the same basic weather pattern.  Hailstones the size of baseballs (up to 3 inches in diameter) pounded the northern 3 mile stretch of these two counties, resulting in substantial damage to hundreds of homes (roofs and siding) and hundreds of vehicles.  Two people in Marquette County and 4 people in Green Lake County were injured by the large hailstones and needed medical treatment. The hailstones left impact marks on sidewalks in the Crystal Lake area of north-central Marched County. In Green Lake County crop damage was also noted.  Downburst winds of 60 to 70 mph also accompanied the hail, resulting in many trees being pushed over. Interestingly, this severe hailstorm occurred north of a warm front, with air temperatures only in the 60s.

This was the third round of severe thunderstorms to strike southern Wisconsin due to the same basic weather pattern.  Hailstones the size of baseballs (up to 3 inches in diameter) pounded the northern 3 mile stretch of these two counties, resulting in substantial damage to hundreds of homes (roofs and siding) and hundreds of vehicles.  Two people in Marquette County and 4 people in Green Lake County were injured by the large hailstones and needed medical treatment. The hailstones left impact marks on sidewalks in the Crystal Lake area of north-central Marched County. In Green Lake County crop damage was also noted.  Downburst winds of 60 to 70 mph also accompanied the hail, resulting in many trees being pushed over. Interestingly, this severe hailstorm occurred north of a warm front, with air temperatures only in the 60s. The warm front moved north to a Wisconsin Dells to Sheboygan line while a frontal "triple-point" formed near the Dells due to a cool front pushing in from the west. The thunderstorm which first produced hail in Sauk County while moving northeast, gradually turned more to the right (east), as it entered Marquette, Green Lake, and Waushara Counties, and transformed into a high-precipitation supercell.

The hail covered the ground to several inches in some locations with most stones in the 1/2 to 1 1/2 inch range, although some were larger.   From central into downtown Omaha, as the hail fell the visibility was lowered to near zero and the hail drifted like snow and shovels were used to clear some sidewalks.  An elderly Omaha woman was injured with some cuts and bruises from the hail when she was caught outside.  According to State Farm Insurance agents, the storm was the costliest hailstorm in the Omaha area at least since the late 1980's and possibly ever.  State Farm estimated that there would be 100,000 claims in the Omaha Metro area.  Most of the larger hail spared the northwest sections of the Metro area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Vehicles sustained extensive body damage and the car windows were shattered.  A handful of people were treated for minor cuts and bruises.  Strong winds also flipped a tractor trailer along Interstate 70 near Watkins.  At least 30 private planes at Front Range Airport were totalled.  The radome protecting the National Weather Service doppler radar, which was tracking the storm, also sustained damage.  The storm caused power outages which affected about 1,200 residents.  Excluding the damage done at Denver International Airport, damage estimates totalled $49 million, making it the costliest storm in the last 3 years, and 10th costliest since 1984.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 49M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This storm exhibited very subtle bowing, but otherwise there was little to note about it's structure. Damage from this storm was limited to a residential mobile and modular home area perched on a broad hill. The homes were situated on 1 acre lots, so they were not densely packed.The damage primarily consisted of rolled and broken mobile homes. The damage area was limited to an area less than one mile in diameter. Five mobile homes were rolled and destroyed. Four mobile and modular homes sustained major roof damage. The mobile homes that were destroyed were scattered between homes which were completely undamaged. Examination of destroyed homes indicated that they were not tied down or had inadequate or no skirting at all. Homes that had plywood skirting and were tied down weathered the storm. Debris patterns provided evidence of diffluent winds, suggesting straight-line downburst winds. Five people recieved minor injuries from side being inside rolled mobile homes. Two injuries were the result of wind driven hail after escaping a destroyed mobile home.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
