Major flooding was noted in many other areas of north and central Georgia, including the eastern suburbs of Atlanta, northwest Georgia, and parts of central Georgia.  The culprit was a very stagnant upper atmospheric pattern featuring a weak upper low that developed in early September across south Texas and slowly migrated east-northeast through September 22nd, until a more significant upper trough dropping south into the southern plains finally moved the pesky upper low northeast of Georgia.  In addition, an unusually deep tropical flow was noted throughout this period.  Precipitable water values exceeded 2.0 inches across the area during much of this period, resulting in extremely efficient rain producing cells.  Persistent heavy rain showers and thunderstorms began to plague the area on the 16th, and persisted daily through the 21st across parts of north and central Georgia.||However, the catastrophic flooding unfolded when a sea breeze moving northwest merged with existing outflow boundaries and higher terrain across the western suburbs of Atlanta to result in persistent heavy thunderstorms for a period of at least 12 hours that trained across the same counties west of Atlanta, generally affecting Carroll, Douglas, Paulding and Cobb counties.  As the activity progressed across the state, significant flooding unfolded further east, including Fulton county, and the city of Atlanta, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties.  Incredible rainfall amounts of 15 to over 20 inches, were observed from northeast Carroll, through much of Douglas, into eastern Paulding and southern Cobb counties.  Rainfall amounts of 10 to 15 inches were noted across parts of Fulton, Dekalb, and Gwinnett.  Rainfall amounts of 8 to 12 inches were noted in other more spotty areas of northwest, north central, and central Georgia during this period.||The excessive rainfall on top of saturated ground resulted in some of the worst flooding ever reported in the Atlanta and north Georgia area.  Eleven deaths were recorded during the event, mostly vehicle related deaths at night from washed out bridges and roads as a result of swollen creeks.  Property damages are estimated to be at least $0.5 Billion, with hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed by flood waters.  Bridges on several state and local highways were washed out and some will take months to even a year to replace.   Eighteen counties (Bartow, Carroll, Chattooga, Cherokee, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Heard, Newton, Paulding, Rockdale, Stephens, and Walker) received a presidential disaster declaration as a result of the historic floods.  Twenty-one counties were declared eligible for public assistance, including several central Georgia counties that were affected by flash flooding earlier in the period.||Some of the worst flooding was observed along Sweetwater Creek near the Cobb, Fulton, Douglas county line.  Hundreds of homes were flooded and destroyed as the waters of Sweetwater Creek rose more than 20 feet above flood level.||Many main stem and secondary creeks, streams, and rivers across north and central Georgia, particularly in northwest and west central Georgia, reached record flood levels.  Many of these same creeks, streams, and rivers remained in flood for several days.  In some cases, all time record flood levels were recorded.  The following is a list of new record flood levels set on several creeks, streams, and rivers in north and west Georgia.  Noonday Creek near Woodstock rose to 19.6 feet on the 21st at 530 pm EDT.

Rainfall exceeded 12 inches in portions of the county during the night and early morning hours.  USGS stream gages verified that significant flooding was underway.  Crooked Creek at Norcross exceeded its flood stage of 11 feet at 306 am EDT.  Pew Creek near Lawrenceville reached its flood stage of 11 feet at 418 am EDT.  Many roads became flooded and impassable as they were submerged by several feet of water in some areas.  A 39-year old female lost her life as her vehicle was washed off Desiree Drive and she was carried away in the flood waters of a small tributary feeding into the Yellow River.  Many homes, apartments, businesses and roads from Norcross to Lawrenceville to Lilburn were flooded during this time frame.

The mobile home was located in a trailer park near Snake Creek, which was observed to have been nearly 20 feet deep.  Local law enforcement officials note that the creek is normally only at a depth of two to three feet.  It took nearly four hours to rescue the three other residents of the home, a man, wife, and 1-year old boy, which were found clinging to trees several yards downstream.

The all time record is 31.60 feet set on December 10, 1919.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous emergency management sources, as well as local law enforcement, newspapers, broadcast media, and National Weather Service surveys confirmed that record and catastrophic flash flooding began across Douglas county during this time frame.  Repeated rounds of thunderstorms with heavy rain tracked from southwest to northeast.  Flash flooding was observed in most parts of the county during this time frame.  Up to six inches of rain fell in this area on already saturated ground.  Rain continued overnight beyond this time frame, with some parts of the county receiving nearly 22 inches by the afternoon of the 21st.  Hundreds of homes and businesses were impacted before the flooding subsided, many totally destroyed.  Dozens of roads and bridges were were washed out as well, including some major roads such as Georgia Highway 166.  Some roads, including Georgia Highway 166 will be closed for up to a year while washed out bridges are repaired.  In addition, Douglas county suffered six flash flood deaths during this event, the most of any county from the historical floods in late September 2009.

The third flash flood death was that of a 26-year old female who also was attempting to cross Mobley Creek at Banks Mill Road.  The fourth flash flood death was that of a 27-year old male attempting to cross Town Branch Creek at Mann Road.  The fifth flash flood death in Douglas county occurred where Stewart's Mill Road crosses Anneewakee Creek when a 49-year old nurse was swept away in her vehicle while attempting to cross the creek.  She was on her way to work at the time.  The sixth flash flood death in Douglas county was that of a 55-year old male.  He was swept away in his Ford Ranger pickup truck while attempting to cross West Bully Creek on North Helton Road.  Numerous other high water rescues took place.  Many took place via boat to rescue people from flood homes, businesses, and vehicles.||During this time frame, damage was estimated to be close to $1 million.  Damages rose into the millions overnight and Monday as the flooding continued and worsened.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.87M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These storms at times produced the full gamut of severe weather, including large hail, damaging winds, tornadoes and flooding. Portions of Marion, Harvey, Butler, Sedgwick and McPherson counties were especially affected by straight-line damaging winds, as a pair or bow echoes surged east to northeast across the area, inflicting damage to numerous barns, outbuildings and some other structures, uprooting trees and downing power poles. Additionally, a handful of relatively weak, short-lived tornadoes skipped across portions of Sumner, Cowley, Butler, Marion and Sedgwick counties during the afternoon and evening hours on the 25th and 26th. A tornado near Lake Afton in southwest Sedgwick county inflicted moderate damage to a residence, and also injured two people. Furthermore, heavy thunderstorms training over the same areas produced widespread areal flooding, river flooding and flash flooding across mainly south-central, east-central and southeast Kansas. Numerous rural and city roads were flooded and subsequently closed due to high water. Various water rescues were needed for stranded motorists, as well as homeowners threatened by flood waters. Numerous homes and businesses were flooded, along with the Cowley County Fairgrounds. Sadly, three flooding deaths occurred, one in Greenwood county and two in Labette county. Some injuries occurred as well.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rainfall from numerous thunderstorms during the afternoon, evening and overnight hours on the 26th produced widespread flooding across much of Harper county. Rainfall amounts across the county ranged from 3 to 6 inches. Numerous roads were closed countywide. It is estimated that around 100 homes were flooded or received some form of water damage in the Anthony area, along with several other homes and businesses across the county. Portions of the elementary school and hospital in Harper were flooded. Three water rescues took place, one of which produced an injury near Third Lake Road when a vehicle attempted to cross a flooded roadway. Crop damage estimates are unknown, and property damage values are rough estimates.

Reports indicated one to three feet of water was present on some city streets. The flash flooding floated several cars and sent storm drains shooting wildly into the air. One storm drain cover injured an individual as the surging water displaced it. Emergency management estimated anywhere from 800 to 1000 structures, mainly homes, were impacted by the flooding.||In addition to hundreds of impacted homes, many well known locations also sustained damage, including the Nicolaysen Art Museum, Wyoming Medical Center, Central Wyoming Fairgrounds, Three Crowns Golf Course, and several city school buildings. Major damage also occurred at Casper College where five buildings, including the gymnasium and theater, were significantly impacted. Retaining wall bricks and landscape gravel were washed from a hillside at the college and cascaded to neighboring residences and streets below. The Hall of Justice on North David Street also sustained significant damage when water poured through a door into an underground garage. The building's elevator shafts and the ceilings in several sheriff's offices were also damaged.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This followed an earlier round of strong thunderstorms and heavy rains earlier in the day. Damage from the thunderstorm winds was widespread across the Niagara Frontier and Western Southern Tier.  Trees as large as two to three feet in diameter were downed. Power outages were scattered throughout the region as the winds downed power lines.|The unprecedented heavy rains that fell���four to six inches in less than two hours���resulted in some of the worst flash flooding the area has seen. Parts of Erie, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus and Allegany counties received State and Federal Disaster Declarations. In the Village of Silver Creek an entire mobile home park along Silver Creek was washed away. The flood waters continued through the heart of the village through the fire station, police headquarters and highway department. Several police cars, an ambulance and much of the town���s highway equipment were lost. In Irving, the flood waters flowed across parts of the New York State Thruway and Routes 5 and 20. Water flooded portions of Lakeshore Hospital there. Also in Irving, the Seneca Nation sustained almost two million dollars in damage to roads and bridges. In total, in Chautauqua county hundreds of homes were damaged and 45 homes were condemned, including the 35 mobile homes of the aforementioned park. In the Village of Gowanda (part of which is in Erie County and part in Cattaraugus county), extensive flash flooding occurred. Tri-County hospital in Gowanda was inundated by flood waters. Patients were transferred to Lakeshore Hospital in Irving. Several hundred homes sustained damage and 40 homes were condemned there. One fatality occurred in Gowanda as an 80-year-old man ventured out to check a bridge on his property and was swept away by the flood waters. The gage on Cattaraugus Creek at Gowanda showed a rise from six feet to near 13 feet in less than an hour (flood stage is 10 feet). Throughout Cattaraugus county over one-quarter of the roads were damaged or lost.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 45.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Numerous impacts were felt in the region, with heavy rain, wind damage, and hail. ||The most severe weather took place in portions of eastern Kansas and western Missouri, as a strong bow echo moved through the area near and just after the midnight hour.  Embedded in this bow echo were small features called meso-vortices, which can often times cause local intensifications of the strong straightline winds, or even produce weak spinnup tornadoes.  One such feature embedded in a smaller bowing storm segment south of the Plattsburg area, led to reports of a damaged greenhouse, tree damage, as well as damage to other nearby structures.  It was determined, that a combination of enhanced straight line winds as well as a very brief and weak (EF0) tornado, produced winds as high as 70 to 85 mph in this area.  Further to the south, strong straight line winds, also blew over trees and caused other forms of property damage, to fences and homes in areas around Kansas City. Several observations of 60 to 70 mph winds were observed in the area. ||However, the biggest impact from this event, was the persistent heavy rain due to the training of storms over the same areas.  The hardest hit areas were in the Kirksville and Chillicothe areas, where rainfall totals in the 3 to 6 inch range were common.  Elsewhere, while rainfall amounts may have been lower, the rapid rainfall rates in excess of 2 per hour, caused localized flash flooding in portions of the Kansas City Metropoitan area and elsewhere. The heavy rains caused many rivers and creeks to go out of their banks.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flash flooding caused pavement over a culvert to give way.

Numerous homes and cars were flooded. One person died, and at least 136 people were injured. Damage was estimated at $5.5 million in Oklahoma county alone.||The event began late on June 13th, as thunderstorms developed over northwest Oklahoma. The thunderstorms developed ahead of a slow moving cold front that was located over southwest Kansas into the northern Texas panhandle. A large outflow boundary also extended eastward. The thunderstorms became more numerous as they moved along the outflow boundary.  Strengthened by the new rainfall, the outflow boundary dropped toward central Oklahoma, and a very moist low-level jet resulted in new thunderstorm development near the boundary.||The first round of significant rain impacted central Oklahoma around 3 am. This round moved east before another, longer lived, thunderstorm complex developed over the Oklahoma City metro area. The outflow boundary was located south of Interstate 40, and the low-level jet transported warm and unseasonably humid air north of the boundary, creating very heavy rain. Thunderstorms continued to develop over the southwest metro area, and slowly moved northeast. Rainfall rates averaged one to two inches per hour, with some thunderstorm bands producing rates near three inches per hour.||The heavy rain accumulated quickly immediately before and during the busy morning drive time. Numerous cars became stranded in the rapidly rising water. Roadways were covered by rapidly flowing water, and ponds, creeks, and rivers easily spilled over their banks. Navigating in and around the metro area became almost impossible, and many motorists had to be rescued by boat. After several hours, the persistent heavy rainfall tapered off around noon.||The larger area of heavy rainfall moved south as the outflow boundary moved into southern Oklahoma. Significant rain developed over southwest Oklahoma by early afternoon, and flash flooding once again became a problem. Lawton was hard hit, receiving between four and five inches of rain, resulting in several roadways becoming flooded. Numerous motorists had to be rescued from the high water. One motorist, unfortunately, lost his life when his vehicle stalled in flood waters.||Thunderstorms developed again over central Oklahoma late in the afternoon and evening, but luckily the duration of the thunderstorms was relatively short. By the time it was all said and done, widespread totals of five to nine inches were reported over much of Oklahoma City. Will Rogers World Airport reported its largest daily precipitation since records began in 1891, with 7.62 inches. Even higher totals were reported over the north-central portion of Oklahoma City, where nine to twelve inches was measured.||Strong winds caused some power outages during the event. At the peak of the event, over 6700 people were without power. Isolated pockets of wind damage did occur, with a power pole/power lines downed south of Drummond in Garfield county.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous roads were closed due to high water.

Railroad tracks across the county sustained damage as well. The flash flooding event transitioned into a flood event as the heavy rain allowed rivers to rise rapidly and overflow their banks.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This pattern remained in place through the evening hours of May 2nd, 2010. South to southwest winds pumped warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and created a very unstable atmosphere. Showers and thunderstorms developed in association with the front during the early evening hours and moved east into Eastern Arkansas shortly before midnight. Additional thunderstorms occurred in association with the upper level disturbance. Due to the unstable atmosphere, thunderstorms quickly became severe producing large hail, damaging winds, and flash flooding. The severe weather evolved into an outbreak by May 1st and 2nd. Historic rainfall and flash flooding in addition to large hail and damaging winds occurred during the early morning hours of May 1st with several tornadoes occurring during the afternoon hours of May 1st to early morning hours of May 2nd.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Very heavy rain produced widespread flash flooding across Tipton County. Up to 20 inches of rain fell causing devastating damage to homes, businesses, roads and bridges. In fact, 40 roads were impassable in Tipton County due to the flooding. Twenty-one of those roads and 14 bridges were washed out as a result of the flooding. Other roads received damage just from the heavy rain. Damage was particularly bad in Atoka and Mason. Numerous vehicles were completely submerged in water. Two apartment complexes in Covington sustained major damage. In total, 309 homes received damage from the flooding. Of those, 96 homes were completely destroyed. As many as 93 businesses were flooded and of those 21 were completely destroyed. Nineteen mobile homes were flooded with 14 being destroyed. Many other structures or buildings were flooded as well. One fatality occurred in Mason. The flash flooding event transitioned into a flood event as rivers rose rapidly and overflowed their banks.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

CAPE rose to 3500-4500 J/kg by the mid to late afternoon with lifted indices of -8 to -10 C.  The moisture pooled over the state with precipitable water values approaching 2 inches by evening.  High temperatures reached the upper 80s to low 90s, with dewpoints topping out in the upper 70s to low 80s.  The atmosphere was fairly weakly sheared with 30 kts of available shear.  Downdraft CAPE was between 1000 and 1800 J/kg.  Available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was 800-1100 J/kg, but hail was limited by the high freezing level, 16,000 to 16,500 feet.  Quarter size hail fell in Calhoun County as an intense storm passed though.  The same storm cluster produced a funnel cloud in Sac County earlier.  Scattered winds occurred with the storms.  A 61 MPH wind gust was recorded in Eagle Grove for example and windows were blown out in Humboldt County south of Thor.  One of the thunderstorms produced a tornado in Emmet County.  The tornado touched down briefly over Lake Iowa.  Thunderstorms became more organized during the evening and produced very heavy rainfall.  In addition to the rainfall, scattered reports of high winds and some hail up to an inch and one quarter in size were received.  Most of the wind reports were around 60 MPH.  By far the most significant weather was the heavy rainfall.  Three to 5 inches of rain fell on saturated ground, resulting in a very widespread flash flood event.  Nearly half of the CWA was involved from parts of north central Iowa south to the Missouri border.  Numerous roads were covered with flowing water of 1 to 2 feet in depth.  Lightning struck a car at mile post 105 on Interstate 35 in Story County.  No injuries were reported.  Lightning also struck a house in Ankeny, causing a fire.  The flash flooding claimed one life in central Iowa.   Three vehicles were swept into the waters of Mud Creek near Altoona in Polk County.  There were 11 people involved.  A rescue call was made to save the occupants of the cars.  One 16 year old female perished in the flood waters, the other 10 were rescued, though 4 were injured and received treatment at a local hospital.  The flash flooding transitioned into widespread flooding as the night progressed into the day of the 11th.  Flash flooding resulted in evacuations of apartments and trailer courts on the east side of Des Moines.  Interstate 35 was covered by water due to flash flooding at mile post 97.  Several cars spun out in the flood waters.  Very intense rainfall in the Ames area resulted in a record crest on Squaw Creek.  The creek crested 1.5 to 2.5 feet above the record high stage.  Major flooding took place and the water treatment plant was inundated.  Major damage was done to several buildings on the Iowa State Campus.  Damage to Iowa State alone was between $40,000,000 and $50,000,000.  Flooding from the Skunk River closed U.S. Highway 30.  Thirty people were rescued at a Wal-Mart store in Ames as well.  Following the severe flooding, several Iowa counties were added to the Presidential Disaster Declaration number 1930.  The original 32 were: Adams, Appanoose, Audubon, Buena Vista, Butler, Cherokee, Clay, Davis, Decatur, Franklin, Howard, Humboldt, Iowa, Lee, Lyon, Madison, Marion, Mills, Monroe, Montgomery, O���Brien, Osceola, Palo Alto, Ringgold, Shelby, Union, Van Buren, Wapello, Warren, Wayne, Webster and Wright.  Eighteen were added to the original, incuding: Black Hawk, Boone, Buchanan, Clayton, Delaware, Dickinson, Dubuque, Emmet, Fayette, Guthrie, Jackson, Jasper, Jones, Lucas, Mahaska, Polk, Sioux and Story.  In addition, Governor Chet Culver had issued disaster proclamations for 50 Iowa counties due to inclement weather since June 1, 2010: Appanoose, Black Hawk, Boone, Buchanan, Buena Vista, Butler, Cherokee, Clay, Clayton, Davis, Decatur, Delaware, Dickinson, Dubuque, Emmet, Fayette, Franklin, Hamilton, Hancock, Howard, Humboldt, Jackson, Jasper, Jefferson, Johnson, Jones, Kossuth, Lee, Lucas, Lyon, Mahaska, Marion, Monona, Monroe, O'Brien, Osceola, Palo Alto, Polk, Ringgold, Shelby, Sioux, Story, Taylor, Union, Van Buren, Wapello, Warren, Washington, Webster and Wright.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Water rescue in progress regarding three vehicles with a total of 11 people near NE 8th Ave and NE 54th Ave.  There was one fatality, 10 rescues and several injuries.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

During the afternoon, a persistent band of strong to severe thunderstorms developed and moved very slowly over south central and southeast Wisconsin through the evening hours. The individual storms were moving quite fast, about 40 to 50 mph, but the slow southward movement of the boundary these storms were developing along, resulted in storms repeatedly training, or moving, over the same area.||Widespread 3 to 4 inch amounts were reported along and either side of the I-94 corridor, with locally higher amounts of 5 to 8 inches.  The greatest rain amounts fell in Milwaukee County. Mitchell Field recorded 5.61 inches for the day, breaking a record for the date. The previous record was 1.26 set in 1948. This also is the second highest daily rainfall total on record for Milwaukee. The greatest one-day precipitation record was the 6.81 inches which fell on August 6, 1986. Madison also set a record for precipitation for the date at 3.62 inches. This beat the previous mark of 2.21 inches set in 1885. The 3.62 inches of rainfall ranks 13th for the most precipitation received in one day. The record is the 4.96 inches which fell on August 8, 1906. ||About 32,000 We Energy utility customers lost electrical power throughout southeast Wisconsin due to the flooding and lightning.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Thunderstorms training over the region produced flooding rains over all of Milwaukee County...causing massive flooding, shutting down streets and the freeway system at rush hour with up to 4 feet of rushing water.||There was one fatality - the body of a 19-year-old male was found in Lincoln Creek near N. 32nd St. and W. Hampton Ave. in Milwaukee.  He was swept from his vehicle when Lincoln Creek flooded. ||County Executive Scott Walker issued a Declaration of a Major Disaster for Milwaukee County since more than 7 inches of rain fell around the county, and an estimated $24.1 million in damage in the private sector, and nearly $11.6 million in public sector costs, which includes protective measures and clean-up costs. ||The private sector damage costs include: $22,396,790 dollars to residential buildings and $1,686,752 dollars to businesses. The public sector costs include: $2,003,010 dollars of damage to public buildings and equipment; $2,385,760 dollars of damage to public utility systems; $2,774,400 dollars or damage to road systems; $310,000 dollars of damage to water control facilities and another $1,326,100 dollars in damage to other public property for a total of $8,799,270. In addition, another $1,946,100 dollars were spent in debris clearance and $894,988 dollars were spent for overtime. These costs are not directly related to the flood damage.||The Milwaukee Fire Department logged 50 rescues from homes and streets.  ||The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD) reported that the storm resulted in a combined sewer overflow of around 2 billion gallons. All Lake Michigan beaches in Milwaukee were closed through the following weekend of July 24th and 25th due to sewer contamination. The City of Milwaukee received at least 2000 calls for sewer backups into basements of homes. It appeared that the northern half of the city of Milwaukee was hardest hit. ||The flooding rains created a massive sink hole 20 feet deep and some 20 to 40 feet wide at the intersection of Oakland and North in the city of Milwaukee around 830 pm.  It swallowed a Sport Utility Vehicle and a street light. The driver of the SUV was injured and treated at a hospital.  Electrical power cables and other cable lines were damaged by the sink hole. ||Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport was closed late Thursday night (July 22nd) through 2 pm Friday (July 23rd) due to flooded runways. One runway was opened at 2 pm Friday, however there were additional delays. ||In Milwaukee County, over 4,400 homes reported water-filled basements in the city of Milwaukee alone.||11,764 homes received some sort of impact from the flooding, with 6 homes destroyed; 57 homes receiving major damage; 1,859 home receiving minor damage; and an additional 9,842 homes minimally affected by the flood waters.

Light to moderate rain continued through the 8th over much of the region and then became much heavier as the center of the storm moved from southwest Oklahoma into northeast Oklahoma late on the 8th and during the early morning hours of the 9th.  The heaviest rainfall totals occurred just east of the storm track.  ||Rainfall rates of over two inches per hour and rainfall totals of eight to fourteen inches across east central OK and northwest AR led to widespread flash flooding during the morning hours of the 9th. The heaviest swath of rain occurred across southern McIntosh, northern Pittsburg, southern Muskogee, Haskell, Sequoyah, and southern Adair Counties in eastern Oklahoma, and some of the worst flooding occurred in these areas. The following locations received in excess of seven inches of rain during the event, much of which fell during a several hour period during the early morning hours of the 9th: 13.42 inches in Whitefield in Haskell County, 11.25 inches in Stigler in Haskell County, 10.41 inches in Sallisaw in Sequoyah County, 10.35 inches in Eufaula in McIntosh County, 9.60 inches at R.S. Kerr Reservoir in Sequoyah County, 8.40 inches in Short in Sequoyah County, 7.69 inches in Scipio in Pittsburg County, and 7.40 inches in Webbers Falls in Muskogee County.||Many small creeks and streams rose very quickly from this rainfall. Businesses and residences in Sallisaw, Oklahoma were inundated by high water, forcing schools to close. Emergency officials performed numerous swift water rescues and many roads were closed due to the high water throughout the area. A 19-yr old male drowned on the morning of the 9th as he tried to drive through high water over a low water crossing seven miles south of Stilwell in Adair County, Oklahoma.

However, well to the north of Karl, a very moist tropical air mass resided and became the focus for a significant rainfall event. This rain event resulted in record flooding on Oso Creek in Corpus Christi, one flash flood fatality, and the flooding of numerous streets, homes, and vehicles along the immediate Texas coastline.||On Sunday September 19th, a low pressure trough developed along the mid Texas coast and interacted with an upper level disturbance which focused the heaviest rainfall over Corpus Christi, Sinton, and Rockport. The heaviest rains occurred between 900 AM and 300 PM Sunday in which up to 7 inches of rain was recorded. These heavy rains caused widespread street flooding and road closures in Aransas, San Patricio, Nueces, and Kleberg Counties. Many homes in Corpus Christi were flooded, especially in the neighborhoods near the intersection of Holly and Greenwood. On Monday September 20th, another 1 to 2 inches of rainfall were recorded.||Runoff from these heavy rains flowed into Oso Creek, which runs along the southwest edge of Corpus Christi. The only gaging site on Oso Creek, located on FM 763 about 2 miles west of town, recorded a rapid rise up to 28 feet on Sunday, before it stopped working. A post storm survey conducted by the National Weather Service and United States Geological Survey confirmed the creek crested at 30.62 feet around 805 AM Monday morning which beat the previous record of 29.37 feet set back on August 10th, 1980 during Hurricane Allen.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 35 year old male drove around a barricade at Weber Road and the flooded Oso Creek.

Numerous homes and cars were flooded. One person died, and at least 136 people were injured. Damage was estimated at $5.5 million in Oklahoma county alone.||The event began late on June 13th, as thunderstorms developed over northwest Oklahoma. The thunderstorms developed ahead of a slow moving cold front that was located over southwest Kansas into the northern Texas panhandle. A large outflow boundary also extended eastward. The thunderstorms became more numerous as they moved along the outflow boundary.  Strengthened by the new rainfall, the outflow boundary dropped toward central Oklahoma, and a very moist low-level jet resulted in new thunderstorm development near the boundary.||The first round of significant rain impacted central Oklahoma around 3 am. This round moved east before another, longer lived, thunderstorm complex developed over the Oklahoma City metro area. The outflow boundary was located south of Interstate 40, and the low-level jet transported warm and unseasonably humid air north of the boundary, creating very heavy rain. Thunderstorms continued to develop over the southwest metro area, and slowly moved northeast. Rainfall rates averaged one to two inches per hour, with some thunderstorm bands producing rates near three inches per hour.||The heavy rain accumulated quickly immediately before and during the busy morning drive time. Numerous cars became stranded in the rapidly rising water. Roadways were covered by rapidly flowing water, and ponds, creeks, and rivers easily spilled over their banks. Navigating in and around the metro area became almost impossible, and many motorists had to be rescued by boat. After several hours, the persistent heavy rainfall tapered off around noon.||The larger area of heavy rainfall moved south as the outflow boundary moved into southern Oklahoma. Significant rain developed over southwest Oklahoma by early afternoon, and flash flooding once again became a problem. Lawton was hard hit, receiving between four and five inches of rain, resulting in several roadways becoming flooded. Numerous motorists had to be rescued from the high water. One motorist, unfortunately, lost his life when his vehicle stalled in flood waters.||Thunderstorms developed again over central Oklahoma late in the afternoon and evening, but luckily the duration of the thunderstorms was relatively short. By the time it was all said and done, widespread totals of five to nine inches were reported over much of Oklahoma City. Will Rogers World Airport reported its largest daily precipitation since records began in 1891, with 7.62 inches. Even higher totals were reported over the north-central portion of Oklahoma City, where nine to twelve inches was measured.||Strong winds caused some power outages during the event. At the peak of the event, over 6700 people were without power. Isolated pockets of wind damage did occur, with a power pole/power lines downed south of Drummond in Garfield county.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Another round of heavy rain occurred over parts of the Oklahoma City metro area. The heavy rain falling on already saturated ground quickly led to flash flooding. Several roadways had to be re-barricaded due to very high water. The water that had receded around some residences began to rise again. After the rain ended, some areas had received over a foot of rainfall for the day. Much of it fell in only a few hours. Total damages for the day were over $5 million. One hundred twenty-two homes were affected, 52 of those home receiving minor damage, 11 receiving major damage, and one home was completely destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

About 100,000 people were evacuated from the Atlantic Coast. Numerous roadways were flooded and closed and thousands of trees were knocked down. About 100,000 utility customers lost power. In addition, chickens were killed by flooding and agricultural crops were damaged by the flooding. Delaware received federal disaster declaration.  ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread Delaware during the afternoon of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 60 mph. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th. The second peak occurred during the late morning and early afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. The rain associated with Irene overspread the state between 7 a.m. EDT and Noon EDT on the 27th, fell at its heaviest from the late afternoon of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended around Noon EDT on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 12 inches and caused widespread and in some instances record breaking flooding. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all stormdata flooding related county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 4 feet caused minor to moderate tidal flooding along tidal sections of the Delaware River and in Upper Delaware Bay and moderate to severe tidal flooding along lower Delaware Bay and along the coast during the evening high tide cycle on the 27th. The winds shifted to the northwest during the morning high tide cycle on the 28th.  ||Governor Jack Markell ordered visitors to evacuate the Delaware beaches effective 6 pm EDT on August 25th. In addition, a state of emergency was declared and shelters were opened throughout the state on August 26th. Driving restrictions were in place. Mandatory evacuations of approximately one hundred thousand tourists and residents occurred, including special populations, began on Thursday, August 25th. The Cape May���Lewes Ferry suspended service for August 27th and 28th. Toll operations on Delaware State Route 1 were halted. Transit services were shut down on August 27th and 28th, while most of the bridges over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and the Indian River were closed due to the wind.||About 100,000 utility customers lost power at the peak of the storm. Power was not fully restored until August 31st. Schools were dismissed early on Friday the 26th and remained closed through the duration of the event. The state highway department reported over two hundred roads under water. Seven bridges sustained structural damage. At least thirty-seven homes and businesses sustained major damage or were destroyed. Extensive damage occurred to the six state maintained beaches as severe beach erosion and dune breaches occurred. The combination of heavy rain and severe tidal flooding washed out Prime Hook Road along Delaware Bay in Cedar Creek Hundred (Sussex County). In Kent County, tidal flooding occurred along Kitts Hummock Road as well as along Bowers Beach. | |The highest wind gusts recorded during Hurricane Irene were 66 mph in Lewes (Sussex County), 64 mph in Dewey Beach (Sussex County), 60 mph in Georgetown (Sussex County), 57 mph in Wilmington (New Castle County), and 52 mph in Dover (Kent County). The highest tides included 8.20 feet above mean lower low water at Breakwater Harbor in Sussex County (severe flooding starts at 8.0 feet above mean lower low water) and 8.03 feet above mean lower low water at Reedy Island in New Castle County. Minor tidal flooding at Reedy starts at 7.2 feet above mean lower low water.||Hurricane Irene formed east of the Leeward Islands on Saturday the 20th. It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th and then proceeded to the northnortheast and went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. Irene then paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A dry line had moved just east of the I-35 corridor of North Central Texas and a strong cold front trailed the dry line. Very strong speed and directional shear was noted in the low and mid levels of the atmosphere such that supercells developed. Many of these produced tornadoes across the region. Other storms produced strong straight line wind gusts with bowing segments and large hail.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A person drove through a barricaded and flooded roadway at Plum Street and the Railroad underpass.

Firefighters rescued both drivers about two hours later, and were transported to a hospital in Rawlins.  Both men were treated for their injuries and later released.  After floodwaters receded, State Highway 130 between mileposts 36 and 68 was closed for repairs.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

For most of this time the wave was nearly surrounded by dry air and with enough vertical wind shear to ensure that any intensification would be slow. Its forward speed of 20 mph somewhat aided the shear in keeping it weak. Irene made landfall over mainland Puerto Rico at 125 am AST on August 22, near Punta Santiago then Luis Munoz Marin International Airport at San Juan recorded its highest wind gust of 59 mph at 218 am AST.  At 300 am AST (0700 UTC) the center was estimated to be 10 miles southwest of San Juan with 70 mph sustained winds, mainly over the Atlantic waters north of the city.||By 500 am AST doppler radar had indicated winds sustained up to 72 knots (83 mph) only 500 to 600 feet above the water. Irene was then officially upgraded to a hurricane though a hurricane warning had already been issued for the region. With the hurricane center moving offshore about this time the strongest winds (north of the center) also moved away from shore. At 536 am AST the buoy near Arecibo recorded its highest wind gust of 37 knots (43 mph). At 900 am AST the center of Irene was directly north of the west coast of Puerto Rico but the hurricane force winds were well offshore with an obviously developing eye on radar.||Puerto Rico was under the effects of Tropical Cyclone Irene from early Sunday August 22 through late Wednesday August 24. Irene made landfall as a tropical storm during the early morning hours of Monday August 22, intensified overland and became a hurricane over northern Puerto Rico around 500 am Monday, before exiting into the Atlantic later that morning. Irene���s most siginificant impact was the heavy rainfall. The first rainbands entered eastern Puerto Rico early on Sunday and persisted through midnight on Wednesday, although additional rainfall was received across some of the east municipalities through Thursday morning August 25. Locations like Gurabo across eastern interior Puerto Rico experienced significant 48 hour rainfall accumulations, with an estimated return period of around 50 years.||Shortly after Irene���s center passed by San Juan on August 22 there were 800,000 homes without electric power and 118,000 without water service. The storm surge from Irene, as expected, was very minor. The highest surges measured were at Esperanza (Vieques) and Fajardo and reached 1.6 feet between 100 am and 200 am (0506z and 0530z respectively). This was during the time that the center of Irene was moving inland over Eastern Puerto Rico.||Damage from flooding was extensive across the region from Irene, however, though wind caused widespread damage it was relatively minor compared to a more significant hurricane. Numerous trees were blown down very early on Monday morning from Fajardo to San Juan Metro. Downed trees were reported to block highways in Gurabo, Adjuntas, Caguas while a down power pole lay on Highway PR-176 in Cupey.||On August 27 Puerto Rico had been declared a major disaster area, and by September 3 additional municipalities were added to provide aid to those impacted, and still more on September 13. In all, there were 29 municipalities approved for individual assistance to individuals and households while 37 municipalities were designated for public assistance to state and local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations for emergency work and the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 62 year old woman in her vehicle was overtaken by flood waters as she attempted to drive across a flooded roadway PR-857 in Barrio Canovanillas, Cohitre sector.

Event precipitation totals averaged 4 to 9 inches, except in Berks County where 6 to 12 inches fell.  One drowning occurred in Philadelphia. The heavy rain caused widespread poor drainage flooding as well as moderate flooding along the Delaware and Schuylkill Basins and minor to moderate flooding along the Lehigh River Basin. Crests in the upper Schuylkill, Lehigh and Delaware River Basins were higher than what occurred with Irene the previous month and the highest crests since late June of 2006 in most instances. The crests along the Delaware River were 2 to 4 feet higher than what occurred during Irene. Some of the smaller streams in southeastern Pennsylvania reached major flooding levels, but most of those crests were lower than what occurred with Irene. In addition to the freshwater flooding, moderate tidal flooding occurred along the lower Delaware River and its tributaries. ||In the most recent available flooding assessment for Eastern Pennsylvania, there were 22 homes and businesses that were destroyed, 201 that suffered major damage, 672 that had minor damage and 1217 others that were affected. The preliminary damage estimate for the state of Pennsylvania was five hundred million dollars.  Please look for possible updates in future monthly issues of stormdata.| |The combination of fresh water runoff and a weak southerly flow produced moderate tidal flooding during the evening high tide cycles from the 7th through the 9th and minor tidal flooding with all of the other high tide cycles from the evening of the 6th through overnight on the 11th. The highest tides occurred during the evening high tide cycle on the 8th in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties and the evening high tide cycle on the 9th in Bucks County.  The evening high tide on the 8th in Philadelphia reached 9.41 feet above mean lower low water. Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. The high tide in Newbold Island (Bucks County) reached 12.11 feet above mean lower low water. There is no current categorical tide gage information for this site.  ||Tropical Storm Lee made landfall in Louisiana during the morning of the 4th and moved slowly northeast. An approaching cold front from the Mississippi Valley reached Lee by the morning of the 5th and transformed it to an extratropical system on the 5th in Mississippi. The same cold front acted as a conduit for Lee's moisture farther to the northeast. Showers and thunderstorms from that approaching cold front arrived during the evening and overnight on the 5th  and set off the first round of flash flooding rains in Northeast Pennsylvania. The front then stalled just south of Delmarva on the 6th. A relative lull in the rain then occurred during the morning of the 6th. As the front started to back north as a warm front later in the day on the 6th, more bands of heavier rain returned that afternoon and particularly that evening. A blocking weather pattern then moved the frontal boundary little from the morning of the 7th into the morning of the 8th across southeast Pennsylvania. A couple of bands of flash flood producing rains started to form and move east into Eastern Pennsylvania during the late afternoon and evening of the 7th and continued through the night.  The frontal boundary started to drift offshore later in the day on the 8th and most of the precipitation associated with Lee was done.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A band of showers and thunderstorms with heavy rain caused flash flooding of smaller streams as well as poor drainage flooding in Philadelphia. It also caused the drowning death of a 27-year-old woman who was caught in flood waters in the East Germantown section of the city.  She was discovered in the rear of her Sports Utility Vehicle at the intersection of Musgrave and Haines Streets on the morning of the 8th.  The Wingohocking Creek, which is a creek that was buried underground during the 19th century had its waters back out of sewer grates and manhole covers in that section of the city.  Godfrey Avenue and Wister Street also flooded in East Germantown. The wall of a church also collapsed. Most gaged creeks within Philadelphia flooded as well as the Schuylkill River.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Meanwhile, a dry slot formed ahead of this feature allowing for increased instability over the mountains and foothills and promoting the development of discrete supercell storms. The storms evolved into a quasi-linear convective system as they moved east across central and southside Virginia. The storms displayed considerable rotation on radar and over a half dozen tornado warnings were issued although no tornadoes were reported. The hail reports from this event were prolific with numerous reports of quarter to golfball size and some almost as big as baseballs. Other reports were of  pea to marble size hail covering the ground to depths of 4 to 6 inches. Rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches were also common with local amounts of 3 to 5 inches causing flash flooding. There was flood fatality in Buckingham County where the driver tried to cross a low-water crossing at a flooded stream and the vehicle was carried downstream. The excessive runoff also resulted in minor river flooding along parts of the lower Roanoke and Dan Rivers. The USGS gauge on the Falling River near Naruna in Campbell County rose almost 10 feet in 6 hours, cresting at 14.42 feet (Flood Stage - 11') early on the 25th. 48-hour rain gauge totals ending 8 AM EDT on March 25th included 4.23 at Raven Rock Church IFLOWS (Patrick County), 4.13 at Ferrum IFLOWS (Franklin Co.), 3.95 at Slate Mtn, IFLOWS (Floyd Co.) and 3.51 at Doe Run Church IFLOWS (Patrick Co.).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rainfall of 2 to 4 inches in several hours caused several small streams to flood including Greasy Creek southwest of Buckingham. After the flooding receded, the County Sheriff's Office said deputies found a deceased 61-year-old woman inside a pickup truck several days after she was reported missing. The truck was found on its side and wedged against a tree, about 300 yards from a dirt driveway that crossed Grease Creek. The sheriff's office said a preliminary investigation indicated that flood waters disabled the truck and carried it downstream when the driver tried to drive across the flooded low-water crossing.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

There was record rainfall in the San Antonio area with the San Antonio International Airport recording 9.87 inches of rain (2nd highest 24 hr total on record) and CoCoRAHS observers reporting over 11 inches.  Most of the rain fell in about six hours with four inches in one hour between 6 and 7 AM. A USGS stream and rain gauge on Olmos Creek and Dresden Drive reported 2.58 inches in 15 min between 615 and 630 am.  The gauge reported 6.13 inches in one hour, 9.46 inches in 2 hours, and totaled 15.31 inches in 5 hours.  A 24hr total at this gauge was 17 inches of rain.  This led to massive flooding in the Olmos Basin/Creek just inside Loop 410 near the Quarry.  Most of the flooding across the city was in north central and northwest San Antonio along and just side Loop 410. This rain came a day after another heavy rain event with parts of the city receiving over two inches. This all led to major flooding with Olmos Creek, the Medina River, Leon Creek, the San Antonio River, and Salado Creek all reaching major flood stage. There were many roads closed including Hwy 281 at Olmos Creek which remained closed for several days. At 10 AM, there was a foot of water over Ingram and Callaghan Rds. San Antonio creeks and streams saw big rises in their levels which led to additional flooding down steam in the south portion of Bexar County.  Areas that were hit the hardest included the Espada Road area near the San Antonio River and Loop 410 intersection.  A mobile home park on Plumnear Road off Leon Creek on the southwest side of the city was flooded out.  Several hundred rescues and calls for rescue occurred during the morning of the 25th.  Two fatalities occurred inside Bexar County. A woman was killed when her car was swept away in flood waters along Leon Creek at the 5800 Block of U.S Highway 90.  Another woman was killed in her car when her car was swept away in the 400 Block of Rhapsody Drive about 730 am.  In all the City of San Antonio and Bexar County Emergency Management agencies found over 350 impacted residences with 15 of those being destroyed and 27 suffering major damage.  The other residences suffered minor damages.  Most of the destroyed residences were in the Espada area along the San Antonio River in southeast Bexar County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This made the region susceptible to additional flooding.||An unusually strong area of low pressure for late June moved from central Pennsylvania northeastward across eastern New York during the early morning hours of Friday, June 28th.   This storm system was more typical of a winter-like storm, due to deep low pressure and heavy precipitation spiraling around the western side of the storm system.  A strong southerly flow ahead of this system transported very moist air into the region.||Heavy rainfall moved across the Mohawk Valley and western Adirondacks in advance of the low pressure during the early morning hours. The rain fell heaviest during the late night hours before tapering off during the late morning.  Rainfall fell at rates of nearly one inch per hour at times with three to five inches of rainfall having occurred in total. This led to significant flash flooding across both the Mohawk Valley and Adirondacks. ||Many roads were washed out and closed, including a portion of the New York State Thruway between exits 29 (Canajoharie) and 29A (Little Falls).  In addition, urbanized areas along the Mohawk River experienced dangerous amounts of flooding.  The entire town of Fort Plain was under water and many swift water rescues had to take place.  Many homes and trailers were impacted by flood waters.  The New York State Barge Canal was closed as a result of the flooding.  In addition, one fatality occurred as a result of the flooding. ||State of emergencies were declared in many communities as a result of the flooding including:  Herkimer County, Montgomery County, Village of Ilion (Herkimer County),  Town and Village of Herkimer (Herkimer County), Village of Mohawk (Herkimer County), Town of Johnsburg (Warren County), Town of Minden (Montgomery County), and the Town of German Flatts (Herkimer County). | |On July 12th, President Obama signed a New York Disaster Declaration and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area affected by severe storms and flooding during the period of June 28 to July 4, 2013. This included Herkimer, Montgomery and Warren counties in east central New York.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flash flooding occurred throughout Fort Plain due to heavy rainfall.  Fifty to one hundred people were trapped in homes and water rescues needed to take place.  Media reported up to two hundred homes were damaged or destroyed by flooding.

Tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, and flash flooding occurred. The flooding killed six people, and the tornadoes killed one. The same weather system caused severe storms and flash flooding again on June 1st. For the 24-hour period ending at 7 AM on the 31st, a band of very heavy rain fell from Waldron and Mena to Conway and Little Rock and then on to Newport and Augusta. Within this band, rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches were common, and isolated totals exceeded 7 inches. Also on the evening of the 30th, 3.09 inches of rain fell in one hour at Little Rock, breaking the all-time record for the greatest amount of rain in one hour in the city. The previous record was 3.00 inches on May 26, 1955. President Barack Obama declared federal disasters in these counties:  Cleburne, Independence, Montgomery, Polk, Scott, Searcy, Stone, Van Buren, and Woodruff.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Severe flash flooding occurred across a large part of Scott County. Soon after Midnight CDT on the 31st, two women called 911 after flooding from Mill Creek trapped them in their house at Y City. The Scott County Sheriff and a Wildlife Officer First Class from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission responded to the call. According to the incident report by the Game and Fish Commission, the rescuers reached the house in an aluminum motorboat, removed one woman from the house and put here in their boat. As they were trying to rescue the second woman, the house collapsed due to the force of the floodwaters. The boat then capsized, drowning the three people in the boat, and the woman in the house also drowned. (The sheriff was a 41 year-old male, the wildlife officer was a 32 year-old male, and the women in the house were females 60 and 65 years old.) It took until June 2nd to recover the bodies of all the victims. Recovery operations were greatly hampered by another round of heavy rain and flooding on the morning of June 1st. Altogether, about 20 people had to be rescued from the flood waters. U.S. 71, the main north-south route through western Arkansas, flooded at Y City. The flooding caused a car to be washed off the highway and a 42 year-old woman in the car drowned. Her husband survived, but had to cling to the bank of a stream for 6 hours before being rescued. Several other cars were washed off roads, as well, but the motorists survived. Arkansas 28 was washed out at Little Cedar Creek (10 miles east of Y City), Big Cedar Creek (12 miles east of Y City), and the Fourche LaFave River (16.5 miles east of Y City). Numerous county roads and bridges were washed out. For the 24-hour period ending at 7 AM on the 31st, Parks measured 7.78 inches of rain and Waldron picked up 5.26 inches. Houses were flooded at a number of places, including Y City, Boles, and Parks. The American Red Cross indicated 7 houses and 15 mobile homes were destroyed, 9 houses and 4 mobile home had major damage, 13 houses and 3 mobile homes had minor damage, and 14 houses and 8 mobile homes were affected. A fiber optic cable was knocked out of service. As a result, there was no landline phone service, cell phone service, or internet service to most of the county for about 24 hours from the 30th into the 31st.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 9.20M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In addition, a weak stationary front stretched along the Front Range Foothills and Palmer Divide.  As a result, a prolonged period of moderate to heavy rain developed across the Front Range Foothills, Palmer Divide, Urban Corridor.  By the 14th, storm totals ranged from 6 to 18 inches, highest in the foothills of Boulder County.  The headwaters then moved down the South Platte River and caused widespread flooding with record flood stages at several locations as it made its way downstream into Nebraska.  Record high flood stages along the South Platte River were recorded at Balzac, Weldona and Julesburg.  As a result, widespread flooding occur along the South Platte for several days as the headwaters continued downstream, with much of the damage reported from Fort Morgan and Brush to around Sterling.  The floodwaters resulted in widespread evacuations.  Numerous water treatment facilities were contaminated and had to be shut down.  The headwaters remained at or above flood stage east of Sterling to Julesburg, but the flooding was not as widespread and the damage not as extensive. ||Initially, the showers that developed on the afternoon of the 11th were moving fast enough and were small enough to produce generally moderate rainfall amounts.   However, rain along the Front Range began to intensify and become more widespread in the evening. A narrow band of very heavy rain began to organize just north of Denver and move westward toward the foothills.  By 9 pm mdt on the 11th, heavy rain was becoming more widespread, with rainfall rates near 2 inches per hour in the heaviest showers.  From 10 pm mdt to Midnight mdt, very heavy rain locked itself in against the Front Range.  Flash flooding became more widespread, with several road closures from northwest Jefferson County northward through Boulder and Larimer Counties.  The heaviest rain in the foothills of Boulder, Larimer and northern Jefferson Counties finally began to abate, but widespread flash flooding continued due to the extremely heavy rainfall during the evening and early morning hours of the 12th.  Meanwhile, torrential rain redeveloped in southwest Weld, northeast Adams, eastern Denver and northwest Arapahoe Counties in the early morning hours of the 12th;  which impacted northeast Denver and Aurora.  ||Atypical for September in Colorado, 24-hour rainfall totals ending 7 am mdt on September 12th included 6.5 to 8.6 inches in Boulder; with 3 to 6.5 inches across the Larimer and Boulder County foothills, as well an area stretching from northeastern Metro Denver area into southwest Weld County.  By 9 am mdt, heavy rain and considerable flash flooding continued through the morning in the Aurora area.   Numerous streams remained at or above bankfull levels across Boulder, Larimer, and southwest Weld counties.  By the evening of the 12th, flooding continued in many areas and increased in severity. Heavy rain, while not as widespread as the previous day, had a greater impact on stream levels as streams were already elevated and the ground was completely saturated. Two peaks of flows occurred on Boulder Creek near downtown. The peak flow on the evening of September 12th surpassed the 1969 Boulder flood, but initial indications are that it fell short of the 1938 and 1894 floods.  Boulder Stream Gauge ���peak flows occurred near 0100 mdt on the 12th, and 2100 mdt on the 12th.   Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Big Thompson River,  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  The headwaters moved down the South Platte with floodwaters impacted Weld, Morgan, Washington and Logan Counties.  Extensive flooding occurred in and around Greeley, Fort Morgan and Sterling.  Large sections of the counties' roads and highways were washed away, with property and crops completely inundated.   ||After little rainfall on Friday, September 13th, the flash flood threat returned for  Saturday. This time, storms with heavy rainfall were concentrated in Douglas County, but also extended northeast into the Aurora area once again. Up to 3 inches of rain fell in one hour.  Plum Creek and other small creeks and streams flooded, along with significant street flooding.  The last day of this prolonged period of very heavy rainfall was on Sunday, September 15th. Another weak front had pushed through the area Saturday night, leaving the atmosphere unseasonably moist and unstable.  Heavy rain developed by mid morning and then became more widespread and peaked in intensity by the noon hour. This time, flash flooding was most significant in the northern portions of the Denver metro area from Northglenn to around Broomfield. Rain finally tapered off during the late afternoon and evening.||The devastating flood damage encompassed 4,500 square miles of the Colorado Front Range, left seven dead, forced thousands to evacuate, and destroyed thousands of homes and farms. Record amounts of rainfall generated flash floods that tore up roads and lines of communication, leaving many stranded.  Nearly 19,000 homes were damaged, and over 1,500 destroyed.  The Colorado Department of Transportation estimated that at least 30 state highway bridges were destroyed and an additional 20 seriously damaged. A preliminary assessment of the state's infrastructure showed damage of $40 million to roads and $112 million to bridges.  Repair costs for state and and county roads were likely to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Miles of freight and passenger rail lines were washed out or submerged, including a section servicing Amtrak's iconic California Zephyr.  The town of Lyons in Boulder County was isolated by the flooding of St. Vrain Creek, and several earth dams along the Front Range burst or were over-topped.   Floodwaters also swept through Estes Park, the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park and a major tourist attraction, and damaged hundreds of buildings and destroyed large sections of the two main roads that led into town; U.S. 34 from Loveland and U.S. 36 from Lyons/Boulder.  U.S. 34 suffered the most damage, with 85 percent of its roadway and bridges destroyed.   In Weld County, approximately 1,900 gas wells were damaged and had to be closed off as the floodwaters inundated entire communities. ||Sewage treatment plants and other utilities were knocked out in a number of towns,  and standing water left by floods on prairie farmlands posed the threat of significant damage to crops already planted in the region.  Northeast Colorado Health Department has advised with the local CSU Extension office in Logan County regarding local crops and gardens that had been exposed to flood waters.  As the flood waters in our area should be considered contaminated, local crops and gardens may not be considered suitable for human consumption or animal feed.  In the flooded areas, an estimated 23,000 acres of cropland was impacted and stretched from Boulder to Logan Counties and included:  alfalfa, corn, hay, silage and sugar beets.  The estimated loss of production ranged from $3.4 million to $5.5 million. ||Governor Hickenlooper declared a disaster emergency on September 13th, in 11 counties across northeast Colorado including:  Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Boulder, Denver, Jefferson, Larimer, Logan, Morgan, Washington and Weld.  By September 15th, federal emergency declarations covered those counties as well as Clear Creek County.  Projected losses from the flooding statewide was nearly $3 billion in property damage.  Half of the damage estimate was from housing and half from the commercial and government sectors, according to Eqecat, a catastrophe modeling firm; this was the first comprehensive estimate of the disaster's economic toll.  The projected losses for residential property alone were about $900 million.  Another $1 billion was attributed to commercial and goverment property, including roads and bridges.  In addition, more than 11 thousand people were evacuated, reportedly the largest since Hurricane Katrina.  President Obama declared a state of emergency for Boulder and Larimer Counties, with an additional 10 counties added September 16th including: Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Clear Creek, Denver, Jefferson, Morgan, Logan, Washington and Weld Counties.  The president also declared a major disaster specifically for Boulder County, which provided for federal recovery assistance. ||There were six fatalities directly attributed to flash flooding.  By county, those fatalities included 4 in Boulder County and 2 in Larimer County.  Two 19-yr old teenagers died on the evening of the 11th, after they were swept away by floodwaters after abandoning their vehicle on Lindon Drive in Boulder.  In Jamestown, a 72-yr old man was killed when the building he was in collapsed.  An 80-yr old Lyons resident was killed in the early morning hours of the 12th, when his truck was swept into the St. Vrain River near his home.   On the evening of the 12th, a 79-yr old Larimer County resident was killed when she was swept away while trying to climb to safety from her home in Cedar Point.   A 61-yr old Cedar Point resident died when her home was swept down the Big Thompson River by the floodwaters.  An indirect fatality occurred on the 16th.  An 80-yr old Idaho Springs resident drowned in Clear Creek when the embankment he was standing on collapsed.||Along the South Platte River, the crest of the flood at Kersey was near 18.8 feet on September 14th, which was significantly higher than the record crest of 11.73 feet set on May 8, 1973.   On September 15th, the flood crest was near 13.7 feet at Balzac which exceeded the record of 13.3 feet set on June 18, 1965.  On September 18th, the flood crest was at Julesburg was 10.6 feet, which broke the previous record of 10.44 feet set on June 20, 1965.  ||In Boulder, some of the monthly records broken included:  one-day all-time record:  9.08 inches which shattered the previous wettest day of 4.8 inches set on July 31, 1919; one-month record of 18.16 inches, which broke the previous all-time monthly record of 9.59 inches set in May of 1995; wettest September on record which broke the previous record of 5.5 inches set in September of 1940; one-year record of 34.15 inches broke the previous wettest year of 29.93 inches set in 1995.  In Denver, the total precipitation for the month of September was 5.61 inches, which was 4.65 inches above the normal of 0.96 inches. This is the most precipitation ever recorded in Denver for the month of September.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> In Boulder, Old Tale Road at McSorley was closed due to debris and downed trees.  Debris forced the partial closure of 3rd Street and Canyon and the Eastbound lane of Baseline Road near Foothills Parkway.  Flooding was also reported at:  9th and Alpine,   9th and Balsam and South Boulder Road at Manhatten Street.  Two teenagers in Boulder were killed when they abandoned their vehicle while trying to flee the floodwaters.  The two other occupants suffered minor injuries; one escaped the vehicle while the other remained in the car and was later rescued.  In the city of Boulder, 61 properties were destroyed.||In the Fourmile burn area, widespread flash flooding and debris flows forced the closure of Fourmile Canyon at Boulder Canyon.  Water was also reportedly flowing over Gold Run Road at Ingram Gulch due to a blocked culvert.  Major structural damage occurred in Fourmile Canyon and Jamestown, which forced a mandatory evacuation of all residents.  A man in Jamestown was killed when the building he was in collapsed.  In the Jamestown area, 26 properties were destroyed.  Flash flooding was also reported in Lefthand Canyon. In unincorporated Boulder County, a total of 86 properties were destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Heavy rain, while not as widespread as the previous day, had a greater impact on stream levels as streams were already elevated and the ground was completely saturated. Two peaks of flows occurred on Boulder Creek near downtown. The peak flow on the evening of September 12th surpassed the 1969 Boulder flood, but initial indications are that it fell short of the 1938 and 1894 floods.  Boulder Stream Gauge ���peak flows occurred near 0100 mdt on the 12th, and 2100 mdt on the 12th.   Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Big Thompson River,  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  The headwaters moved down the South Platte with floodwaters impacted Weld, Morgan, Washington and Logan Counties.  Extensive flooding occurred in and around Greeley, Fort Morgan and Sterling.  Large sections of the counties' roads and highways were washed away, with property and crops completely inundated.   ||After little rainfall on Friday, September 13th, the flash flood threat returned for  Saturday. This time, storms with heavy rainfall were concentrated in Douglas County, but also extended northeast into the Aurora area once again. Up to 3 inches of rain fell in one hour.  Plum Creek and other small creeks and streams flooded, along with significant street flooding.  The last day of this prolonged period of very heavy rainfall was on Sunday, September 15th. Another weak front had pushed through the area Saturday night, leaving the atmosphere unseasonably moist and unstable.  Heavy rain developed by mid morning and then became more widespread and peaked in intensity by the noon hour. This time, flash flooding was most significant in the northern portions of the Denver metro area from Northglenn to around Broomfield. Rain finally tapered off during the late afternoon and evening.||The devastating flood damage encompassed 4,500 square miles of the Colorado Front Range, left seven dead, forced thousands to evacuate, and destroyed thousands of homes and farms. Record amounts of rainfall generated flash floods that tore up roads and lines of communication, leaving many stranded.  Nearly 19,000 homes were damaged, and over 1,500 destroyed.  The Colorado Department of Transportation estimated that at least 30 state highway bridges were destroyed and an additional 20 seriously damaged. A preliminary assessment of the state's infrastructure showed damage of $40 million to roads and $112 million to bridges.  Repair costs for state and and county roads were likely to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Miles of freight and passenger rail lines were washed out or submerged, including a section servicing Amtrak's iconic California Zephyr.  The town of Lyons in Boulder County was isolated by the flooding of St. Vrain Creek, and several earth dams along the Front Range burst or were over-topped.   Floodwaters also swept through Estes Park, the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park and a major tourist attraction, and damaged hundreds of buildings and destroyed large sections of the two main roads that led into town; U.S. 34 from Loveland and U.S. 36 from Lyons/Boulder.  U.S. 34 suffered the most damage, with 85 percent of its roadway and bridges destroyed.   In Weld County, approximately 1,900 gas wells were damaged and had to be closed off as the floodwaters inundated entire communities. ||Sewage treatment plants and other utilities were knocked out in a number of towns,  and standing water left by floods on prairie farmlands posed the threat of significant damage to crops already planted in the region.  Northeast Colorado Health Department has advised with the local CSU Extension office in Logan County regarding local crops and gardens that had been exposed to flood waters.  As the flood waters in our area should be considered contaminated, local crops and gardens may not be considered suitable for human consumption or animal feed.  In the flooded areas, an estimated 23,000 acres of cropland was impacted and stretched from Boulder to Logan Counties and included:  alfalfa, corn, hay, silage and sugar beets.  The estimated loss of production ranged from $3.4 million to $5.5 million. ||Governor Hickenlooper declared a disaster emergency on September 13th, in 11 counties across northeast Colorado including:  Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Boulder, Denver, Jefferson, Larimer, Logan, Morgan, Washington and Weld.  By September 15th, federal emergency declarations covered those counties as well as Clear Creek County.  Projected losses from the flooding statewide was nearly $3 billion in property damage.  Half of the damage estimate was from housing and half from the commercial and government sectors, according to Eqecat, a catastrophe modeling firm; this was the first comprehensive estimate of the disaster's economic toll.  The projected losses for residential property alone were about $900 million.  Another $1 billion was attributed to commercial and goverment property, including roads and bridges.  In addition, more than 11 thousand people were evacuated, reportedly the largest since Hurricane Katrina.  President Obama declared a state of emergency for Boulder and Larimer Counties, with an additional 10 counties added September 16th including: Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Clear Creek, Denver, Jefferson, Morgan, Logan, Washington and Weld Counties.  The president also declared a major disaster specifically for Boulder County, which provided for federal recovery assistance. ||There were six fatalities directly attributed to flash flooding.  By county, those fatalities included 4 in Boulder County and 2 in Larimer County.  Two 19-yr old teenagers died on the evening of the 11th, after they were swept away by floodwaters after abandoning their vehicle on Lindon Drive in Boulder.  In Jamestown, a 72-yr old man was killed when the building he was in collapsed.  An 80-yr old Lyons resident was killed in the early morning hours of the 12th, when his truck was swept into the St. Vrain River near his home.   On the evening of the 12th, a 79-yr old Larimer County resident was killed when she was swept away while trying to climb to safety from her home in Cedar Point.   A 61-yr old Cedar Point resident died when her home was swept down the Big Thompson River by the floodwaters.  An indirect fatality occurred on the 16th.  An 80-yr old Idaho Springs resident drowned in Clear Creek when the embankment he was standing on collapsed.||Along the South Platte River, the crest of the flood at Kersey was near 18.8 feet on September 14th, which was significantly higher than the record crest of 11.73 feet set on May 8, 1973.   On September 15th, the flood crest was near 13.7 feet at Balzac which exceeded the record of 13.3 feet set on June 18, 1965.  On September 18th, the flood crest was at Julesburg was 10.6 feet, which broke the previous record of 10.44 feet set on June 20, 1965.  ||In Boulder, some of the monthly records broken included:  one-day all-time record:  9.08 inches which shattered the previous wettest day of 4.8 inches set on July 31, 1919; one-month record of 18.16 inches, which broke the previous all-time monthly record of 9.59 inches set in May of 1995; wettest September on record which broke the previous record of 5.5 inches set in September of 1940; one-year record of 34.15 inches broke the previous wettest year of 29.93 inches set in 1995.  In Denver, the total precipitation for the month of September was 5.61 inches, which was 4.65 inches above the normal of 0.96 inches. This is the most precipitation ever recorded in Denver for the month of September.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> In Boulder, many vehicles were abandoned near Lookout Road and Spine due to floodwaters.  Significant flooding was reported at the Justice Center; the Juvenile Detention Center had to be evacuated to the second floor.  Floodwaters to a depth of 2 feet inundated Hawthorne Street in north Boulder.  Moderate flooding was observed along Boulder Creek.  Boulder Canyon was closed due to flash flooding.  Numerous rock and mudslides made Lefthand Canyon impassable. Major structures were lost in Jamestown.  In Lyons, rock and mud slides were also reported and the Waste Water Treatment Plant was breached.  An 80-yr old man was killed when his truck was swept into the St. Vrain River.  He had returned to his home to look for his wife.  His vehicle was found 200 yards from their residence.  In town, 82 properties were destroyed.  Mandatory evacuations were ordered in Longmont, along the Lefthand and St. Vrain Creeks.  In Longmont, 53 properties were destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In addition, a weak stationary front stretched along the Front Range Foothills and Palmer Divide.  As a result, a prolonged period of moderate to heavy rain developed across the Front Range Foothills, Palmer Divide, Urban Corridor.  By the 14th, storm totals ranged from 6 to 18 inches, highest in the foothills of Boulder County.  The headwaters then moved down the South Platte River and caused widespread flooding with record flood stages at several locations as it made its way downstream into Nebraska.  Record high flood stages along the South Platte River were recorded at Balzac, Weldona and Julesburg.  As a result, widespread flooding occur along the South Platte for several days as the headwaters continued downstream, with much of the damage reported from Fort Morgan and Brush to around Sterling.  The floodwaters resulted in widespread evacuations.  Numerous water treatment facilities were contaminated and had to be shut down.  The headwaters remained at or above flood stage east of Sterling to Julesburg, but the flooding was not as widespread and the damage not as extensive. ||Initially, the showers that developed on the afternoon of the 11th were moving fast enough and were small enough to produce generally moderate rainfall amounts.   However, rain along the Front Range began to intensify and become more widespread in the evening. A narrow band of very heavy rain began to organize just north of Denver and move westward toward the foothills.  By 9 pm mdt on the 11th, heavy rain was becoming more widespread, with rainfall rates near 2 inches per hour in the heaviest showers.  From 10 pm mdt to Midnight mdt, very heavy rain locked itself in against the Front Range.  Flash flooding became more widespread, with several road closures from northwest Jefferson County northward through Boulder and Larimer Counties.  The heaviest rain in the foothills of Boulder, Larimer and northern Jefferson Counties finally began to abate, but widespread flash flooding continued due to the extremely heavy rainfall during the evening and early morning hours of the 12th.  Meanwhile, torrential rain redeveloped in southwest Weld, northeast Adams, eastern Denver and northwest Arapahoe Counties in the early morning hours of the 12th;  which impacted northeast Denver and Aurora.  ||Atypical for September in Colorado, 24-hour rainfall totals ending 7 am mdt on September 12th included 6.5 to 8.6 inches in Boulder; with 3 to 6.5 inches across the Larimer and Boulder County foothills, as well an area stretching from northeastern Metro Denver area into southwest Weld County.

Water and debris over three feet deep from Waldo Canyon stranded 40 vehicles in the westbound lanes, with several sent racing down a drainage onto the westbound entrance ramp from Manitou Springs.  Business 24 out of Manitou Springs was severely damaged and will be closed until further notice.  One man drowned in the debris flow near the mouth of Waldo Canyon.  In Manitou Springs there was major flooding from Williams Creek.  Several structures near and on Canon Avenue and Manitou Avenue, including the Spa Building and Arcade experienced deep water, mud, and debris flows.  Fountain Creek overflowed, flooding many businesses.  Forty vehicles were damaged or destroyed.  There were no fatalities in Manitou Springs, although there were two water rescues along Fountain Creek.  In Fremont County, water flowed deeper than six inches across US Highway 50 on the Parkdale hill.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A surface trough was the focus of training storms which produced heavy rainfall that led to major flooding across the Onion Creek and Blanco/San Marcos River watersheds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rains in excess of 14 inches upstream of Austin in the Onion Creek Watershed near Wimberley caused a flash flood that hit portions of South Austin in the early morning hours.  Water started to rise and flood portions of the Onion Creek area near Interstate 35 by 4-5am on the morning of the 31st and water continued to rise into the early morning hours.  USGS gauges were overtopped near Twin Creek Road and this record flood water continued to move along Onion creek, passing under I-35 and inundating several neighborhoods between I-35 and US Highway 183.  A reverse 911 was utilized by the City of Austin to help evacuate residents but flood waters rose so quickly that most residents sheltered in place and were rescued by truck and helicopter later that morning.  Those that tried to escape the flood waters via their vehicles got caught in the rising waters and this led to several fatalities.  A mother and infant son died when their SUV vehicle was swept off the Onion Creek bridge on Bluff Springs Road in the predawn hours around 430 am. Another resident in a neighborhood along Onion Creek was also found drowned as his vehicle got swept off the road and was recovered near Pleasant Valley Drive and William Cannon.  Almost 2 weeks later the body of a homeless man was found in Williamson Creek near South First Street and Heartwood.  He was presumed a flood fatality from this event.  Manual readings were performed by USGS at the Onion Creek/Highway 183 gauge site ATIT2.  The creek crested just over 40 feet at 930 am the morning of October 31st.  This was a new record height for this location and translated to about 135,000 cubic feet per second. In total across Travis County and the City of Austin, over 700 homes were damaged by the flooding, of which over 100 were destroyed.  Most of the affected homes did not have insurance and were within the 100 year flood plain of Onion Creek.  Flood recovery lasted for several weeks including debris removal. Damage estimates are still being calculated as of this writing but damages across Travis County and the City of Austin look like they will exceed 100 million dollars.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At least 4 back-to-back upper level disturbances pushed north and east across the region and interacted with the monsoon moisture plume through the 14th to produce widespread historic rainfall amounts.  Significant flooding impacted the state as rainfall amounts over this 5-day period averaged 3 to 6 inches and in some areas just over 10 inches.  Several river gauges reported record to near record crests and in a couple cases gauges were completely destroyed.  Emergency management reported disastrous impacts to residential, commercial, and transportation infrastructure.  A total of 14 counties, 4 cities and towns, 5 pueblos, and the Navajo Nation were included in a statewide and Presidential disaster declaration.  The New Mexico State EOC was staffed at Level 2 operations for several days.

The combination of abundant moisture and instability and northwest flow aloft produced repeated rounds of heavy rainfall across areas in northern as well as central portions of the state including the Las Conchas burn scar and the Albuquerque Metro Area. Rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches were reported with these storms. Flooding initially occurred in north-central NM during the afternoon and evening hours before training cells developed in northern Bernalillo County during the overnight hours. The Interstate 25 corridor around Bernalillo into north Albuquerque was one of the hardest hit. Widespread flooding was reported in Bernalillo due to the heavy rainfall and a breached acequia. Up to 5 feet of water was reported in one home in Bernalillo.  Frequent cloud to ground lightning strikes created numerous power outages across Santa Fe with nearly 30,000 customers out in Albuquerque.

The result was widespread flash flooding as the storms affected every county in the WFO Cleveland county warning area.||In addition to the flooding, widespread severe weather including three tornadoes occurred on July 10th.  A line of intense thunderstorms developed ahead of the advancing cold front during the afternoon hours.  Thunderstorm wind gusts in excess of 70 mph were reported.  Seneca and Sandusky Counties in north central Ohio were especially hard hit.  Thousands of downed trees and widespread power outages were reported.  The Bellevue area was especially hard by the combination of straight line winds and a weak tornado.  Nearly every street in the city had damage of some sort and it took five days for power to be restored to the majority of the city.  Another tornado formed in northeastern Seneca County and moved in Huron County.  A third tornado affected portions of rural Ashland County.  Large swaths of corn were flattened across northern Ohio and nearly every county reported severe weather.

The flooding initially began on the east side of the city in the Haywood Rd/downtown airport area, where several cars were stalled in deep, rushing water due to an overflowing culvert on Byrdland Dr (3 E Downtown). A 39-year-old man and 36-year-old woman who abandoned their vehicles to seek higher ground drowned after being swept into the fast-moving water and nearby culvert which drained into Laurel Creek. A tributary of Richland Creek flooded several dozen apartment homes along Villa Rd between Pleasantburg Dr and Pelham Rd (2.5 ENE Downtown). The most severe flooding occurred on the east side of downtown, near the Stone Ave/I-385 intersection, due to a combination of Richland Creek overflowing its banks by several feet and major urban flooding. Multiple vehicles were stalled in high water in this area. The high water caused a gas leak and explosion at a restaurant on Stone Ave, causing significant damage to the exterior of the building. Richland Creek and the Reedy River overflowed their banks and flooded much of Cleveland Park, which remained closed for two days. This was the worst flooding along this portion of the Reedy in almost 10 years. Additionally, a small tributary of Langston Creek flooded the intersection of Langston Dr and Highway 276 (3 NNW Downtown). Finally, Rocky Creek, or a culvert draining into Rocky Creek overflowed along I-85 near the Pelham Rd exit (7 E Downtown), sending water over the southbound lane and forcing closure of the interstate for several hours.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Minor tidal flooding also occurred with the morning high tides at Sandy Hook (Monmouth County) on the mornings of the 12th and 13th.  The highest tides of the event occurred on the 12th and included 6.59 feet above mean lower low water in Atlantic City (Atlantic County), minor tidal flooding starts at 6.0 feet above mean lower low water;  7.26 feet above mean lower low water in Cape May (Cape May County), minor tidal flooding starts at 6.7 feet above mean lower low water and 7.27 feet above mean lower low water in Sandy Hook (Monmouth County), minor tidal flooding starts at 6.7 feet above mean lower low water. The tidal affected Watson Creek in Manasquan (Monmouth County) had minor flooding on the evening of the 12th also. It crested at 6.13 feet, minor flooding starts at 5.5 feet. Minor tidal flooding extended into the tidal sections of the Delaware River on the early morning of the 13th. On Reedy Island (New Castle County), the high tide reached 7.60 feet above mean lower low water. Minor tidal flooding starts at 7.2 feet above mean lower low water.

Over the next several days, moisture increased over the region ahead of a strong upper level system. Beginning in the early morning hours of the 6th, bands of showers and thunderstorms moved north across the ArkLaMiss region. This continued through the day as heavy rain fell over some already saturated ground. During the late afternoon and evening hours of the 6th, the stalled front started to move slowly north as a warm front. This occurred as a surface low developed across the Texas coast and began to track northeast. This was able to bring mid 60 degree dew points into the region to just north of the Highway 84 corridor and allow for storms to become more surface based which brought a threat for damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes.||The most significant impact from this weather system was from the prolonged heavy rainfall. Rainfall totals ranged from a widespread 2-4 inches with a few swaths of 5 to 7 inches. This sort of rainfall produced many instances of flash flooding along with significant river flooding after the rains ended. Multiple roads were washed out in some locations from the copious amounts of rain that fell along with many other roads covered with water. The Strong River at D'Lo, in Simpson County, crested at a record flood stage of 34.3 feet. Due to its close proximity to U.S. Highway 49, flood waters crept across the road and forced closure for a few days. Tallahala Creek at Laurel rose to major flood stage, cresting at 19.36 feet on April 8th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 9 year old girl was swept away by flood waters in the vicinity of 7th Street.

As a result, high rainfall amounts were observed from Delray Beach to Jupiter. The heaviest rain fell from about 8 PM to Midnight. The area from Kings Point to Boynton Beach, Hypoluxo and Town of Palm Beach received the heaviest amounts of 10 to 20 inches, with the maximum amount reported from a mesonet site in Boynton Beach just east of I-95 and north of Gateway Boulevard receiving an astonishing 22.21 inches in about a 6-hour period. Other reports were 16.03 inches just southwest of Palm Beach, 15.04 inches at Lantana and 13.13 inches at Boynton Beach. These heavy rainfall amounts also resulted in several road closures including all lanes of I-95 in Boynton Beach between mile markers 56 and 60  with many cars on side streets reported being flooded. Tragically, two fatalities were also reported the following morning: a 56-year old female drove her vehicle off a flooded roadway in Delray Beach and into a lake and also in Delray Beach, a 90-year old male drowned after slipping into a canal while walking down a street. Several businesses and residences also reported inundation during the event but little damage was reported, including along Worth Avenue in Palm Beach, Boynton Beach east of I-95 and in parts of Delray Beach. ||Approximately 200 homes had water intrusion, although the vast majority of these only had minor flooding.

The activity on the 2nd consisted of elevated thunderstorms with lightning along the coast during the morning and a few thunderstorms over the San Bernardino County mountains. Rain and rapid cooling in one of these storms resulted in several bicyclists being treated for hypothermia during the Tour de Big Bear race. This elevated convection became intense and transitioned into numerous strong thunderstorms on the 3rd, focusing more on the mountains and deserts and closing several roadways due to flooding. Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches occurred in less than 3 hours across steep terrain in the San Bernardino County mountains. The hardest hit areas were Mt Baldy, Forest Falls and Oak Glen where numerous debris flows occurred causing road damage and closures. Incident Command Posts were set up at both Mt Baldy and Valley of the Falls. A weather station in Mt Baldy reported 4 inches of rain in less than 2 hours. Swift water rescues were performed in Mt Baldy along the LA County line. There was also a large area of 1 to 2.5 inches of rain in low-lying areas and deserts, including 2.73 inches in one hour at the Borrego ALERT gage. The Fish Creek RAWS in the San Diego County desert recorded 2.77 inches of rain in one hour, resulting in moderate flooding and the subsequent closure of Fish Creek Road through August 8th. Heavy rain west of the mountains produced flash flooding in Redlands and Ramona. A large sink hole developed in Redland due to heavy rainfall. San Bernardino County was the hardest hit with flash flooding, with 25 homes damaged and approximately $11 million in damage county-wide for this event. Full storm surveys were done from Mill Creek near Forest Falls, to Oak Glen, to Lytle Creek and through out Mt Baldy on August 4th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> CHP reported a flooded wash with multiple cars stuck in the area.  4 inches of rain recorded in gauge within 2 hours on the steep slope of big Mt Baldy. A hiker parked their car in the small town of Mt Baldy and hiked to the top. Hail and lightning caused them to go back down the mountain early. They used the dry creek to go back|down and were swept away in a flash flood over 10 feet, per NWS Storm Survey of high water marks on trees. The hiker's car was found the next|day during the NWS Storm Survey. The car was destroyed and the person drowned somewhere along the middle or bottom of the creek, just on the San Bernardino County side. LA County Fire department led the search and rescue. Since Mt Baldy|town, where the car was parked, is in San Bernardino County they ended up having a unified command with Los Angeles County, San Bernardino Fire, and Town of|Mt Baldy.  At least 2 vehicles were towed out of the creek. We were told at the survey that the cars were on the Los Angeles County side of the mountain but washed downstream, and across the San Bernardino County side of the mountain, where the one fatality of a 48-yr old man from El Segundo, occurred.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
