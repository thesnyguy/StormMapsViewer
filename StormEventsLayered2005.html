Therefore, event times are estimates. Damage at Cheney Lake State Park was extensive, and included the marina, around 125 boats, 35 campers, and mobile homes. All 6 people injured by the severe thunderstorms required transport to Wichita hospitals. The extent/magnitude of their injuries was unknown as of this writing. The fatality resulted when the victim was trying out a newly acquired fishing boat. Missing since the severe thunderstorms reached Cheney Lake, his body was found on Tuesday, around 10 a.m., in shallow water near an east-side shore amongst downed cottonwoods. As of this report, it was unknown whether the cause of death was the result of drowning or trauma.Governor Sebelius issued a declaration of disaster emergency for Reno County. An estimated 2,500 farm dwellings and service buildings sustained damage totalling an estimated $2.5 million. Approximately 50 pieces of farm machinery and equipment were damaged or destroyed totalling an estimated $500,000 damage. An estimated 155,000 acres of farmland were considered a total loss. Crop losses, and their respective acreages: Wheat: 2,000; Corn: 15,000; Grain sorghum: 25,000; Soybeans: 10,000. Miscellaneous land damages due to erosion & gullying: 116,000.

A large area of high pressure aloft was located over the west half of the country, placing Iowa in a large scale northwest flow pattern.  A weak cold front dropped southeast through the Dakotas and approached northwest Iowa.  At the same time, a series of MCS's developed over the Rockies, and rode around the upper level ridge of high pressure.  During the day, the dew points across Iowa warmed into the mid 60s to mid 70s with surface temperatures in the mid to upper 80s.  The lifted index by evening was in the -5 C. range with CAPE values in the 2000 to 3000 J/kg range.  The provided a rich environment for an MCS that approached the state during the later part of the afternoon.  The MCS developed over eastern Wyoming and southwest South Dakota earlier in the day.  As it overtopped the upper ridge, it turned southeast into Iowa.  As it did, the storms took on more of a bow echo appearance and the cluster became a small Derecho.  Early on in the event a tornado touched down briefly in Emmet County north of Gruver.  It was in open fields and caused little damage.  The main mode of severe weather was in the form of high winds.  There were  few hail reports, however with the freezing level above 16,500 feet, hail was limited.  The winds caused widespread damage from Emmet County, east to Winnebago County, then south into the central part of the state about as far south as Interstate 80.  South of this area no damage was reported as the storms weakened rapidly.  Two semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned in Story County by the high wind about 2 miles west of Nevada.  There was one injury from this.  One of the drivers had to be rescued as he hung over the edge of a bridge.  He was taken to hospital, treated, and released.  There were numerous reports of tree and power line damage over the northwest, north central, and central counties of the state.  High winds blew windows out of a home at the ISU Agronomy Farm.  Structural damage was reported in Marshall County at State Center.  The roof of a large building with a roof of less than two years of age received damage.  A high school roof in Story County at Nevada had its roof partially peeled back as well.  In addition to these reports, there were scattered reports of outbuildings and sheds being flattened by the wind.  Visibility during the high winds was occasionally reduced to near zero in blowing dust by the time the storms reached central Iowa.  The gust front from the storms had moved well ahead of the storms themselves, some 10 to 15 miles ahead, with some of the areas receiving severe winds not receiving any rainfall at all.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Temperatures ranged from the mid 80s across south central Wisconsin to near record highs in the lower 90s across southeast Wisconsin.  There were primarily two areas that were affected by severe thunderstorms.  A broken line of severe storms from Marquette to Dane County tracked east northeast into Dodge, Fond du Lac, Washington, and Sheboygan  counties.  This line produced damaging wind gusts from between 50 to 62 knots (58 mph to 71 mph).  Tree and power line damage was reported across many areas affected by this line of storms.  Another area affected by severe storms stretched from Rock county through Walworth, Waukesha, Milwaukee, and Ozaukee counties as one large supercell developed and tracked northeast along I-43.  Several reports of damaging winds estimated in excess of 70 knots (80 mph) were collected from portions of Waukesha county.  Widespread tree and power line damage was noted from Mukwonago through Brookfield.  More sporatic tree and power line damage was reported across northern Milwaukee and southern Ozaukee counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Powerful thunderstorm winds toppled a tree, which fell onto a car, injuring one person.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In addition, the base of an upper level trough moved across south-central Texas Thursday afternoon.  This feature provided some large scale lift and ushered colder mid and upper level air across the region, which destabilized the atmosphere as surface temperatures rose into the upper 70s and low 80s.  The surface high pressure center to the northeast provided a moderate easterly flow near the surface which quickly turned southeast to south above the surface.  In addition, modest westerlies existed in the mid and upper levels of the atmosphere.  This vertical wind shear together with the modestly unstable atmosphere provided an environment favorable for rotating thunderstorms.  During the afternoon scattered thunderstorms began to develop in the warm, unstable airmass across the Rio Grande Plains and deep south Texas.  A few thunderstorms, which developed along the weak surface boundary, gained strength and became severe as they moved southeast along the boundary. The event began as a strong storm developed near Zavala/Frio Counties in the western hill country.  This storm quickly became severe as it crossed into La Salle County, gaining supercell characteristics as it traveled along the surface boundary across La Salle and southwest McMullen counties.  Reports of dime to penny size hail and 60 mph wind gusts were received by storm spotters just south of Dilley in northern La Salle County.  No storm reports were received in McMullen County, likely because of the lack of population and roadways through the area where the severe storm tracked. The storm tracked through southwestern McMullen and northern Duval Counties, maintaining its strength while exhibiting strong convergence in the middle portions of the storm (MARC signature) at times.  Another storm pulsed up across north-central Jim Wells County before weakening southeast of Alice. Outflow from this storm, as well as moderate to strong east to northeast flow across the Coastal Bend and southeast Rio Grande Plains, may have contributed to an enhanced area of wind shear across Duval County.  As the La Salle/McMullen supercell thunderstorm moved into this area across Duval County, the thunderstorm circulation steadily deepened and strengthened.  Doppler radar showed and a reflectivity notch developing right along the above mentioned boundary associated with the increased storm rotation. A Tornado Vortex Signature developed near this notch prompting a tornado warning.  Prior to the tornado warning, severe thunderstorm warnings were present through the life of this storm due to strong hail signatures and severe straight line wind indications seen on doppler radar. A NWS storm survey team toured Duval and Jim Wells counties and concluded the damage was largely a result of straight line winds from a long track supercell thunderstorm.  However, it cannot be ruled out that an isolated tornado was embedded in the storm. Wind speeds were estimated to range from 80 to 100 mph which is equivalent to an F1 tornado on the Fujita damage scale.  The damage swath, which was approximately 4 to 5 miles in width and over 40 miles in length, stretched from just east of Freer to near  Premont. Broken windows and roof shingle damage on all properties was observed on the northwest side, which indicated straight line wind damage and the wind blowing from the northwest to the southeast.  American Electric Power (AEP) crews on the scene reported that roughly 100 power poles were knocked down across Duval and Jim Well counties.  The NWS team assessed that all poles were blown in the downwind direction to the southeast. Visible damage began near Highway 44 and FM 3196, where roughly half a dozen power poles were split in half.  The damage continued in the community of Rosita in which houses experienced minor damage.  Hail was also reported up to 4 inches in depth.  Indications that flash flooding occurred on Rosita Creek was observed.The storm appeared to strengthen as it approached the northeast side of Benavides and the town of San Jose.  Two mobile homes were destroyed and tree limbs were broken with all damage lying in a southeast direction.  Fifteen homes were damaged in San Jose with window and roof damage on the northwest side, which again indicates the wind blew from the northwest to the southeast. Just southeast of San Jose, near the intersection of FM 2295 and FM 1329 and extending south all the way to Rios, tree limbs and power poles were broken and lying in a southeast direction.  An empty grain silo was also destroyed and a newly framed home was blown off its foundation. In extreme southwest Jim Wells county near the intersection of county road 428 and 716, a large empty grain silo was destroyed and lying in the middle of the roadway.  Power poles were knocked down, 5 homes were damaged, and 1 garage was completely destroyed.  Again all the visible damage was lying in a southeast direction. Eye witness reports indicate that nickel to quarter sized hail covered the ground up 4 to 6 inches deep along the entire storm track.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An NWS storm survey concluded straight line winds severely damaged roughly 15 homes, a community center and church.  Nearly all the damage was observed on the northwest sides of the structres with debris scattered to the southeast.  Two mobile home were completely destoyed, with one man injured that was inside one of the mobile homes.  The two mobile homes that were completly destroyed were oriented north-northeast to south-southwest, perpendicular to the northwest to southeast straight-line winds observed on radar.  The damage from the two mobile homes was thrown to the southeast roughly 20 yards.  In addition numerous large trees and power poles were uprooted and broken, all lying to the southeast direction.  Several vehicles were also damaged by the uprooted trees and debris from homes.  Winds were estimated between 80 and 100 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Lowland flooding occurred along the East Fork White River in Jackson County.  The White River in southern Indiana rose to bankfull levels.  This was the result of the melting snow cover.With warm air over Indiana, a storm system brought 2 to 4 inches of rain to much of central and southern Indiana from the 1st through the 3rd.  Because of the saturated soil conditions, widespread local flooding occurred in central and southern Indiana.  The major rivers in the state were flooding by the 4th. Another storm system quickly followed from the 4th through the 6th. This storm system tracked across southern Indiana and brought 2 to possibly 5 inches of rain to central and southern Indiana.  Because much of this rain fell as freezing rain just north of Indianapolis, two very significant weather events occurred; a major ice storm and flood.Major flooding resulted along the White, East Fork White and Wabash River in southern Indiana.  Flood levels that had not been seen in 40, 50 or more than 90 years occurred just south of the Indianapolis area.  New record stages were set at the White River at Edwardsport and the Wabash River at Mount Carmel.  The White River at Hazleton approached its record stage.Flooding in southern Indiana was much worse than the January 1991 flood.  Areas affected in the January 1991 flood were affected again and more severely.  These included Shelbyville, Rushville, Seymour, Wheeler Hollow, Bedford, Shoals, Spencer, Elnora, Edwardsport, Petersburg area, Hazleton, East Mount Carmel and New Harmony.  Numerous state roads and local roads flooded by several feet.  Many local agricultural levees were overtopped.As this flood unfolded, cold air behind this storm system shut off the rain but left several inches of snow covering central and northern Indiana on the 7th and 8th.  Flooding fighting in southern Indiana occurred during rather harsh January conditions from the 7th through the 10th.  Milder conditions returned on the 11th.Some of the significant events during this flood include:Columbus, a large city in southern Indiana, had only one access road to I-65 causing long traffic delays.   Sandbagging efforts to save a power substation that served much of Rushville.A flood fight in Shelbyville to keep the Big Blue River from portions of the town.At least 70% of Jackson County was flooded.  Evacuations occurred in Rockford, Shields and Brownstown area.A levee failed along the Eel River in the Jasonville area.  Flood waters rose to within 10 inches of a power box for the Jasonville water system.  Power was shut down and the town lost its water until flood levels receded.Spencer lost wastewater treatment service.  This closed nearly all the restaurants in town.  Flood waters were within 2 ½ blocks of the Owen county courthouse.Flood waters at the Columbus wastewater treatment plant reached so high that employees were evacuated.  The plant was operated by the automated system for 12 hours.Personnel of the Indiana National Guard waged a major flood fight to save the Hazleton levee that protected nearly ½ of the town.  At times the levee partially failed but was reinforced.Personnel of the Indiana National Guard sandbagged at State Road 64 to protect East Mount Carmel, Indiana.  Sandbagging occurred on the Illinois side near Rochester.Potential major problems at the Edwardsport Power Plant on the White River were averted.Coal shipment to a major power plant in Gibson County was threatened by high levels on the Wabash River.  The situation was monitored closely.Local Sandbagging in the Elnora area saved several homes.While major flooding was spreading throughout southern Indiana, central Indiana experienced extensive flooding on the White River from Muncie through Indianapolis and the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes.  Sandbagging was necessary in Anderson and Ravenswood areas.   The warmer temperatures on the 11th began to melt the snow and ice that covered central and northern Indiana.  An additional 1 to 4 inches of rain fell in much of central Indiana late on the 11th.  This caused flash flooding in portions of Delaware, Madison, Tipton and Howard Counties.  The most serious flooding was in the towns of Alexandria and Kokomo.  Significant flooding occurred in Albany and Eaton.  Flooding returned to the White River in central Indiana as a result of the rain on the 11th.   After reaching a crest, the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes began to rise again.  January 12 was the warmest and one of the driest days in the New Year.  Temperatures in central and southern Indiana soared into the 60s.  Mild conditions were short lived.As cold air pushed through Indiana on the 13th, an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain fell in central and southern Indiana.  This rain caused widespread local flooding.  Major flooding developed along the White River in Hamilton and northern Marion Counties.  Flood levels approached those of January 1991 in this area.  Evacuations occurred in the Ravenswood area.  Some homes had their power turned off because of high water levels.Major flooding developed on the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes as a result of the rain on the 13th.  Flood levels in the Lafayette and Covington areas reached their highest levels since July 2003.  Flooding from Montezuma to near Vincennes was the highest since June 1958.As this major flood crest was moving downstream along the Wabash River, flood fighting occurred under very brutal conditions.  Temperatures fell below freezing late on the 14th.  Snow of 1 to 4 inches fell in much of eastern Illinois and central Indiana on the 16th.  Temperatures dropped below zero on the 17th and 18th in the Hutsonville and Vincennes areas.  Temperature moderated to more normal levels by 19th.Areas along the Wabash River most severely flooded included, Montezuma, Clinton, Taylorville and Riverview in Indiana and Darwin, York, and Hutsonville in Illinois.  Flood waters overtopped many local agricultural levels.  Flood waters affected the cemetery at Palestine, Illinois. As the Wabash River approached record levels at Hutsonville, the Island Creek levee across from the Hutsonville Power Plant failed during the late evening on the 17th.  The level of the Wabash River fell 5 inches immediately in the town of Hutsonville.  Daylight revealed the levee breach was 300 to 500 feet wide and covered 5,000 acres of farmland with 7 to 8 feet of flood waters.  This breach damaged State Road 154 between Hutsonville and Grayville.  Now a short 5 mile drive for local residents was a 70 mile one way journey. The breach of the Island Creek levee caused the Wabash River to crest immediately at Hutsonville and very soon afterwards at Riverton.  The river crested at Vincennes within a day after the levee failure.  Water flowing back into the river from the area protected by the Island Creek levee caused another crest at Riverton and Vincennes.  This level was slightly lower than the crest after the breach.Rain on the 11th and 13th fell as the rivers were near crest in the Petersburg, Hazleton and Mount Carmel areas.  The combination of rain and very cold temperatures hindered flood fighting in these areas.  By the 13th the rivers crested at Petersburg, Hazleton, Mount Carmel and New Harmony.  Flood waters would continue to recede for the remainder of January, although at times very slowly. The flood crest at New Harmony was the highest since January 1950.Another crest followed the major flood that had occurred along the White and East Fork White Rivers in much of southern Indiana.  This crest was 2 to 3 feet lower on the White River from Centerton to Edwardsport.  On the East Fork White River this crest was more than 8 feet lower in the Columbus and Bedford areas and 1 ½ feet lower at Seymour.  These crests washed out as they approached Petersburg.  The great flood of January 2005 began to wind down at all locations on the 20th.  Mother Nature had thrown every type of severe winter weather at the residents in the Wabash River Valley. Upwards of 30 inches of snow and 12 inches of water had fallen during the prior 30 days.By the end of January flooding had ended everywhere in the Wabash River Valley except for lowland flooding along portions of the Wabash River.  Millions of dollars in flood damage had occurred since the beginning of winter.  The great flood of January 2005 was the most extensive in areal coverage for Indiana since March 1913 and possibly unprecedented.  At least 4,000 homes and businesses flooded and more than 7,000 people displaced.  One person died while attempting to cross the extensively flooded Wabash River in Warren County.Crests on the major rivers in central Indiana were as high as 15.5 feet above flood stage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A man attempted to cross a bridge over the swollen Wabash River and was swept to his death.  It was after dark, and water was over the road approaching the bridge.  It is believed that the man crawled through the car window in an attempt to get to safety and was swept away by the strong current.  The search was called off on 12 January to wait until the waters receded, due to the hazardous nature of the search.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

To the south of the boundary, dew points were in the 50 to 55 degree range.  The heaviest rain amounts were from Perry County on north and east into eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania.  Preliminary 5 day totals were 5.2 inches for New Lexington, 4.6 inches at McConnelsville, 4.5 inches at Nelsonville, 4.2 inches at McArthur and Beverly, 3.4 inches at Athens, and 2.9 inches at Marietta.  Small stream flooding started during the morning hours on the 5th, across Perry, Athens, Morgan, Vinton, and Washington Counties.  Some of the flooded streams included Jonathan Creek in northern Perry County, plus Monday and Sunday Creeks in southern Perry County and northern Athens County.   Sunday Creek crested at 15.8 feet on the 6th at Glouster, and near 23 feet at Millfield.  On Monday Creek, the gauge at Doanville crested at 19.1 feet on the 6th.  In Perry County, 9 families were evacuated.  The small stream flooding across Vinton County was limited to flooded roads.  Significant river flooding occurred on the Muskingum, the Hocking, and the Ohio River.  The crest on the Hocking River at Athens was 23.7 feet around 1100E on the 7th.  This was the highest level since the 24.65 feet observed on the 25th of May in 1968. It was the highest stage since the river was rechanneled in 1972. The crest level was also the 5th highest on record for Athens.  Communities such as Nelsonville and Chauncey were flooded.  The lowest and most vulnerable sections of Chauncey had water inside dwellings and other buildings.  In Athens, the storm drainage system backup into the business area along East State Street.  Some homes on Blick Avenue were flooded.  West Union Street was also flooded and closed.  Elsewhere in Athens County, the high water along the Ohio River affected Hockingport.  All total, about 73 homes in Athens County had minor damage, 56 homes had major damage, and 11 homes were destroyed.  About a dozen businesses applied for disaster loans.In McConnelsville of Morgan County, the Muskingum River crested at 13.45 feet around 1400E on the 6th.  This was the highest level since the 13.8 feet seen back in March 1964.  Water rescues were performed by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the county sheriff department.  An 85 year old woman was rescued from her flooded mobile home along the Muskingum River on the 6th.  She did not want to evacuate earlier and had her pets inside.  When finally rescued, she was sitting on a chair, with water almost up to her knees.  Her feet were swollen.  She never recovered from the hypothermia, and died several days later.   A second crest would occur less than a week later, from additional rain and dam releases.  See the 12th for details.  In Morgan County, around 142 homes had minor damage.  One furniture store in McConnelsville had flood waters inside.     In Washington County, small stream and river damage was less severe than in September 2004.  The Ohio River crested at 41.0 feet at Marietta 2SW during the predawn hours of the 8th.  The crest was 42.4 feet the previous September.  Flood stage is 34 feet.  Downtown Marietta streets and businesses were still flooded, but sandbags protected most 1st floors.  Further down the Ohio River, Racine Lock and Dam crested at 48.9 feet.  The crest at Pomeroy was 50.5 feet around 0000E on the 9th.  Flood stage is 46 feet at Pomeroy.  Back in September 2004 the crest was 51.2 feet.  Water still got into businesses.  All total, Meigs County had 17 homes with minor damage, 2 homes with major damage, and 3 homes destroyed.  Five businesses had major damage and 1 business was destroyed.     The crest near Gallipolis, at the RC Byrd Lock and Dam was 50.3 feet around 1400E on the 9th.  This was just over the 50 foot flood stage.  For the Chesapeake to South Point reach of the river, the Huntington gauge crested at 51.8 feet during the evening hours of the 9th.  This was about 6 inches higher than in September 2004.  Flood stage at Huntington is 50 feet.  Around 0845E on the 6th, just north of the Belleville Lock and Dam, the tugboat Jon Strong was heading up the Ohio River.  After passing through the lock chamber, 9 of the 12 barges came loose in the strong currents.  Three of barges sank under the gates of the dam, while 3 others were forced up against the dam pier houses.  Three other barges went through the structure and were recovered downstream.  Salvage crews did not remove all the damaged barges until the last day of the month.  Since the gates could not be closed, the pool above Belleville Lock and Dam dropped 10 to 15 feet below normal.  River traffic was suspended on the 19th.  River bank slippage occurred around Hockingport during the unusually low levels late in the month.  This caused damage to roads and a few homes. Water levels returned toward normal in early February.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The relatively warm air ahead of the storm raised snow levels and rain fell on an already deep snowpack and resulted in the second costliest natural disaster in state history. An estimated $300 million in damage was reported from flooding along the Santa Clara and Virgin Rivers in Washington County. One man was killed in the flooding near Quail Creek Reservior and three people perished in avalanches. The Virgin River water level reached a 25-year high and the Santa Clara River rose above any previously recorded level. 30 homes were destroyed as the Santa Clara changed course and cut through a portion of the community. Approximately 20 more homes were significantly damaged during this record flood event. This storm system also brought heavy and wet snowfall to elevations above 8000 feet. Many avalanches occurred throughout the state following the storm. A large avalanche killed a snowboarder in Ephraim Canyon. East of Mount Pleasant, a slide took the life of a snowmobiler. Some of the higher snowfall and water equivalent totals include: Cedar Breaks 70" and 10.70" water, Kolob-Zion Park 60" and 8.70, Alta 58 and 9.13, Solitude 55 and 9.71, Brian Head 51, Laketown 47 and 3.67, Snowbird 32 and 5.46, Randolph 32 and 2.18, The Canyons 31 and 3.55, Long Valley<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The damage path continued northeast, but ended about 200 yards north of highway 14. After briefly lifting, the tornado struck a tire distribution center just north of the highway 221 I-385 exchange. The roof of a building at the plant was damaged, which sparked a large fire in the building, burning it to the ground. An employee at the plant received minor injuries when debris fell on him. The tornado dissipated near highway 221 north of Laurens.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Sixteen tornadoes were documented on this day in south-central and southeast Wisconsin, a new single-day record.  A line of supercells developed and pushed across south-central Wisconsin during the afternoon hours, and then pushed east across southeast Wisconsin during the evening hours.   Most of the tornadoes were associated with two supercells.  One main supercell tracked across Sauk County and then into Columbia, producing one F0 and one F2 tornado.  The F2 tornado crossed into Columbia County.  Another main supercell produced an F3 tornado that devastated the area north of city of Stoughton (Dane Co.), and a weaker F1 tornado just south of the city of Rockdale (Dane Co.).  This supercell then tracked into southwestern Jefferson County a short time later, producing two F0 tornadoes and four F1 tornadoes.  The sixteen (16) tornadoes contributed largely to both the new state record of 27 tornadoes on a single day, and 62 tornadoes for a calendar year.  In additiion, there were scattered reports of funnel clouds, damaging straight-line, downburst winds, and large hail across south-central and southeast Wisconsin.  The total direct damage estimate for the afternoon and evening tornado and severe weather outbreak in south-central and southeast Wisconsin on August 18th was about $36.6 M ($35.7 property and $948 K crop).  Additional indirect costs totaled almost $1.9 M, resulting in a total direct and direct cost of about $38.5 M. Synoptically, a surface low pressure system was located over extreme southeast Minnesota early in the afternoon.  A warm front extended east southeast from the low with dew points pooling in the lower 70s along it.  The surface low moved east into east central Wisconsin by 2100CST that evening.  Favorable wind shear associated with the warm front, combined with the strong instability supplied by the heat and humidity, helped to produce numerous tornadic supercells.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A strong and destructive tornado spun up at 1715CST about 2.8 miles southeast of the geographic center of Fitchburg (or 2.0 miles north of center of Oregon), about 400 yards southwest of the intersection of CTH MM and Schnieder Rd.  It continued east-southeast to the southern edge of Lake Kegonsa and tore through residential neighborhoods about 1/3 to 1/2 mile north of CTH B (Civil Towns of Dunn and Pleasant Springs, and far-northern Stoughton).  It moved over the crossing of CTH A with Interstate 90/39, and stayed close to CTH A to its exit point at 1905CST where CTH A crosses into Jefferson County, about 2.8 miles south-southwest of Rockdale.  One person was crushed to death in their basement from fireplace and chimney bricks that crashed through the floor.  Twenty-three (23) other people were directly injured.  In addition, Emergency Management officials received reports of 2 other indirectly-related deaths associated with this strong tornado.  In these two cases, the people were already very ill or suffering from a life-ending  disease.  Injuries they received during the tornado contributed (secondary) to their death, but were not the primary cause of death, based on medical examiner reports.  Consequently, these additional two deaths do not appear in the official death tally in the header strip of this event.  Numerous homes, businesses, farm buildings, vehicles, power-lines, trees, and other personal effects were either damaged or destroyed along its path that grew to a maximum width of about 600 yards north of Stoughton.  As for residential structures, 220 sustained minor damage, 84 had major damage, and 69 were destroyed.  As for business structures, 6 sustained minor damage, 1 had major damage, and 1 was destroyed.  As for agricultural structures, 5 sustained minor damage, 5 had major damage, and 40 were destroyed.  Total estimated damage amounts (directly-related) for private and public sectors combined was $35.06 M, broken down to $34.31 M in property damage and $750 K in crop losses, for the tornado segment in Dane County.  This tornado was probably the 3rd most costly tornado in Wisconsin's recorded history (1996 Oakfield tornado and 1984 Barneveld tornadoes were more costly). The $34.31 M in property damage was broken down to private losses (total of 32.29 M) and public losses (total of $2.02 M), per Emergency Manager reports and NWS estimates.  The private losses included a total of $25.45 M for residential structures, $1.29 M for businesses, $4.25 M for agricultural structures, $1.00 M for damage to vehicles, boats, and other personal effects, $200 K to agricultural machinery and tools, and $96 K in public road system damage.  The public losses making up part of the $34.31 M consisted of $2.02 M in damage to public utility systems.  The $750 K in damage attributed to crop losses occurred on an estimated 1,550 acres of land.  Additional monetary costs incurred in the public sector (totaling $1.84 M) which are considered indirectly-related damage expenses, and not included in the "direct" totals listed in the header-strip of this event, include: $1.38 M in debris clearance, $308 K in protective measures, and miscellaneous damage/expenses of $144 K.  Therefore, the grand total of direct and indirect damage amounts and expenses attributed to this tornado segment in Dane county totaled about $36.89 M.Just south of the tornado, extending out another mile or so, tree and power-line damage resulted from rear-flank downdraft damage - in some cases south to STH 51.  This damage is separate from tornado damage, and isn't included in the numbers in previous sentences.  Debris from this tornado was lofted by the parent's updraft and carried downstream to scattered locations in the counties of Jefferson, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Walworth, Racine, and Kenosha.  This tornado was extensively photographed and video-taped by storm spotters (amateur radio operators, etc.), storm chasers, and private citizens.  On occasions, this tornado displayed multiple-vortex characteristics.  Due to partial back-building (to the west-southwest) of the supercell's updraft tower, this tornado moved slowly, and was described by some eyewitnesses and spotters as being nearly stationary at times north of Stoughton.  The overall slow movement (supercell moved at 12-17 knots, or 10-15 mph), coupled with structures that were not thoroughly reinforced (based on NWS damage survey), allowed the tornado's cyclonic winds to more severely damage buildings in its path.  Consequently, although some of the worst damage resembled what would be left by a F4 tornado for well-built homes, this tornado was rated at the top of the F3 category with estimated winds near 174 knots (200 mph).  The F3 category has estimated wind speeds of 137-179 knots (158-206 mph).  A sampling of newspaper headlines and personal quotes included: "The Sky Just Exploded,"  "Hard to Believe There Weren't More Deaths," "New Technology Lowers Tornado Deaths,"  "Counting Losses, Blessings," "It Was Probably The Most Intense Storm In The Country This Year," "It's a Mess Out Here," and "I've Never Experienced Anything Like This."  The tornado cut electrical power for 1700 customers in the Stoughton area.  The estimated average path length was about 175 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 34.31M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Sixteen tornadoes were documented on this day in south-central and southeast Wisconsin, a new single-day record.  A line of supercells developed and pushed across south-central Wisconsin during the afternoon hours, and then pushed east across southeast Wisconsin during the evening hours.   Most of the tornadoes were associated with two supercells.  One main supercell tracked across Sauk County and then into Columbia, producing one F0 and one F2 tornado.  The F2 tornado crossed into Columbia County.  Another main supercell produced an F3 tornado that devastated the area north of city of Stoughton (Dane Co.), and a weaker F1 tornado just south of the city of Rockdale (Dane Co.).  This supercell then tracked into southwestern Jefferson County a short time later, producing two F0 tornadoes and four F1 tornadoes.  The sixteen (16) tornadoes contributed largely to both the new state record of 27 tornadoes on a single day, and 62 tornadoes for a calendar year.  In additiion, there were scattered reports of funnel clouds, damaging straight-line, downburst winds, and large hail across south-central and southeast Wisconsin.  The total direct damage estimate for the afternoon and evening tornado and severe weather outbreak in south-central and southeast Wisconsin on August 18th was about $36.6 M ($35.7 property and $948 K crop).  Additional indirect costs totaled almost $1.9 M, resulting in a total direct and direct cost of about $38.5 M. Synoptically, a surface low pressure system was located over extreme southeast Minnesota early in the afternoon.  A warm front extended east southeast from the low with dew points pooling in the lower 70s along it.  The surface low moved east into east central Wisconsin by 2100CST that evening.  Favorable wind shear associated with the warm front, combined with the strong instability supplied by the heat and humidity, helped to produce numerous tornadic supercells.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A strong and destructive tornado spun up at 1715CST about 2.8 miles southeast of the geographic center of Fitchburg (or 2.0 miles north of center of Oregon), about 400 yards southwest of the intersection of CTH MM and Schnieder Rd.  It continued east-southeast to the southern edge of Lake Kegonsa and tore through residential neighborhoods about 1/3 to 1/2 mile north of CTH B (Civil Towns of Dunn and Pleasant Springs, and far-northern Stoughton).  It moved over the crossing of CTH A with Interstate 90/39, and stayed close to CTH A to its exit point at 1905CST where CTH A crosses into Jefferson County, about 2.8 miles south-southwest of Rockdale.  One person was crushed to death in their basement from fireplace and chimney bricks that crashed through the floor.  Twenty-three (23) other people were directly injured.  In addition, Emergency Management officials received reports of 2 other indirectly-related deaths associated with this strong tornado.  In these two cases, the people were already very ill or suffering from a life-ending  disease.  Injuries they received during the tornado contributed (secondary) to their death, but were not the primary cause of death, based on medical examiner reports.  Consequently, these additional two deaths do not appear in the official death tally in the header strip of this event.  Numerous homes, businesses, farm buildings, vehicles, power-lines, trees, and other personal effects were either damaged or destroyed along its path that grew to a maximum width of about 600 yards north of Stoughton.  As for residential structures, 220 sustained minor damage, 84 had major damage, and 69 were destroyed.  As for business structures, 6 sustained minor damage, 1 had major damage, and 1 was destroyed.  As for agricultural structures, 5 sustained minor damage, 5 had major damage, and 40 were destroyed.  Total estimated damage amounts (directly-related) for private and public sectors combined was $35.06 M, broken down to $34.31 M in property damage and $750 K in crop losses, for the tornado segment in Dane County.  This tornado was probably the 3rd most costly tornado in Wisconsin's recorded history (1996 Oakfield tornado and 1984 Barneveld tornadoes were more costly). The $34.31 M in property damage was broken down to private losses (total of 32.29 M) and public losses (total of $2.02 M), per Emergency Manager reports and NWS estimates.  The private losses included a total of $25.45 M for residential structures, $1.29 M for businesses, $4.25 M for agricultural structures, $1.00 M for damage to vehicles, boats, and other personal effects, $200 K to agricultural machinery and tools, and $96 K in public road system damage.  The public losses making up part of the $34.31 M consisted of $2.02 M in damage to public utility systems.  The $750 K in damage attributed to crop losses occurred on an estimated 1,550 acres of land.  Additional monetary costs incurred in the public sector (totaling $1.84 M) which are considered indirectly-related damage expenses, and not included in the "direct" totals listed in the header-strip of this event, include: $1.38 M in debris clearance, $308 K in protective measures, and miscellaneous damage/expenses of $144 K.  Therefore, the grand total of direct and indirect damage amounts and expenses attributed to this tornado segment in Dane county totaled about $36.89 M.Just south of the tornado, extending out another mile or so, tree and power-line damage resulted from rear-flank downdraft damage - in some cases south to STH 51.  This damage is separate from tornado damage, and isn't included in the numbers in previous sentences.  Debris from this tornado was lofted by the parent's updraft and carried downstream to scattered locations in the counties of Jefferson, Waukesha, Milwaukee, Walworth, Racine, and Kenosha.  This tornado was extensively photographed and video-taped by storm spotters (amateur radio operators, etc.), storm chasers, and private citizens.  On occasions, this tornado displayed multiple-vortex characteristics.  Due to partial back-building (to the west-southwest) of the supercell's updraft tower, this tornado moved slowly, and was described by some eyewitnesses and spotters as being nearly stationary at times north of Stoughton.  The overall slow movement (supercell moved at 12-17 knots, or 10-15 mph), coupled with structures that were not thoroughly reinforced (based on NWS damage survey), allowed the tornado's cyclonic winds to more severely damage buildings in its path.  Consequently, although some of the worst damage resembled what would be left by a F4 tornado for well-built homes, this tornado was rated at the top of the F3 category with estimated winds near 174 knots (200 mph).  The F3 category has estimated wind speeds of 137-179 knots (158-206 mph).  A sampling of newspaper headlines and personal quotes included: "The Sky Just Exploded,"  "Hard to Believe There Weren't More Deaths," "New Technology Lowers Tornado Deaths,"  "Counting Losses, Blessings," "It Was Probably The Most Intense Storm In The Country This Year," "It's a Mess Out Here," and "I've Never Experienced Anything Like This."  The tornado cut electrical power for 1700 customers in the Stoughton area.  The estimated average path length was about 175 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 34.31M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado began just east of County Road 19 near Cornelius Church Road. The tornado traveled northeast and produced significant damage in the Buhl community. Three mobile homes were totally destroyed, two mobile homes suffered major damage, and at least 4 others sustained minor damage on McAllister Road. Two male occupants of a mobile home were injured when the high winds demolished the home. One man was hospitalized. The tornado continued northeastward and crossed County Road 140, US Highway 82 and County Road 21. Several more structures sustained minor roof damage along the path. Additionally, numerous trees were snapped off or uprooted. The tornado snapped off several trees along the northwest side of Lake Lurleen before lifting just north of the lake around 417 PM CDT. This was the same parent thunderstorm that produced the brief tornado near the Tuscaloosa Greene county line. Local media outlets captured this tornado on video. The tornado has been rated an F1 on the Fujita scale. The tornado damage path was 6.7 miles long and 150 yards wide at its widest point. This tornado was produced by the remnants of Hurricane Rita.

The first tornado touched down briefly just west of Centerville (Trempealeau County). The only damage reported with this tornado was several trees knocked down just north of Highway 35 along County Road G.  A second and stronger tornado occurred just north of County Highway KK, or just west of Esofea (Vernon County).  There was tree, agricultural and structural damage.  A moblie home, which was on cement blocks, was completely destroyed.  The occupant of the mobile home was taken to a hospital with minor injuries.  Another residence sustained minor damage, with windows blown out, outbuildings destroyed and a car turned 90 degrees.  Power poles were snapped, corn was flattened and there was significant tree damage.  The third and strongest tornado touched down just west of Liberty (Vernon County), then tracked along a continous path just north of Highway 56, to the northern most block of the town of Viola (Richland County).  Three people were reported injured in Viola and almost every tree in the town was damaged or downed.  Most homes in the village had at least minor damage, while a few sustained major damage, including roofs blown off.  Many garages facing west or southwest were destroyed by the direct impact of the winds.  Wind speeds associated with the tornado were estimated at 100 to 120 mph.  The tornado path became more sporadic as it moved east of Viola across northern Richland County.  The damage path extended from just north of County Highway MM and Highway 56 into Bloom City (Richland County), which apparently took a direct hit from the storm.  The tornado continued on an east-southeast track, before lifting just west of Hub City (Richland County).  A fourth tornado touched down along County Road N, or just east of the location where Interstate 90 and 94 split in eastern Monroe County.  This tornado continued on a 10 mile track into Juneau County, ending just west of the Necedah Wildlife Refuge Headquarters.  There was tree, agricultural and structural damage.  A home, which was under construction, was completely destroyed.  Three other homes sustained minor damage.  Corn was flattened and there was significant tree damage as well.  A fifth tornado touched down in the town of Muscoda (Grant County) causing minor damage to homes, but knocking down or shearing off numerous trees.  This tornado crossed the Wisconsin River into the small community of Orion (Richland County).  Several mobile homes were damaged, including several reportedly tossed into the air.  Many trees were damaged there as well.  The sixth and final tornado briefly touched down near the intersection of Highway 82 and 13 in Adams County.  Mobile homes were damaged, along with nearby trees.  Richland and Vernon County were declared federal disaster areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first tornado touched down briefly just west of Centerville (Trempealeau County). The only damage reported with this tornado was several trees knocked down just north of Highway 35 along County Road G.  A second and stronger tornado occurred just north of County Highway KK, or just west of Esofea (Vernon County).  There was tree, agricultural and structural damage.  A moblie home, which was on cement blocks, was completely destroyed.  The occupant of the mobile home was taken to a hospital with minor injuries.  Another residence sustained minor damage, with windows blown out, outbuildings destroyed and a car turned 90 degrees.  Power poles were snapped, corn was flattened and there was significant tree damage.  The third and strongest tornado touched down just west of Liberty (Vernon County), then tracked along a continous path just north of Highway 56, to the northern most block of the town of Viola (Richland County).  Three people were reported injured in Viola and almost every tree in the town was damaged or downed.  Most homes in the village had at least minor damage, while a few sustained major damage, including roofs blown off.  Many garages facing west or southwest were destroyed by the direct impact of the winds.  Wind speeds associated with the tornado were estimated at 100 to 120 mph.  The tornado path became more sporadic as it moved east of Viola across northern Richland County.  The damage path extended from just north of County Highway MM and Highway 56 into Bloom City (Richland County), which apparently took a direct hit from the storm.  The tornado continued on an east-southeast track, before lifting just west of Hub City (Richland County).  A fourth tornado touched down along County Road N, or just east of the location where Interstate 90 and 94 split in eastern Monroe County.  This tornado continued on a 10 mile track into Juneau County, ending just west of the Necedah Wildlife Refuge Headquarters.  There was tree, agricultural and structural damage.  A home, which was under construction, was completely destroyed.  Three other homes sustained minor damage.  Corn was flattened and there was significant tree damage as well.  A fifth tornado touched down in the town of Muscoda (Grant County) causing minor damage to homes, but knocking down or shearing off numerous trees.  This tornado crossed the Wisconsin River into the small community of Orion (Richland County).  Several mobile homes were damaged, including several reportedly tossed into the air.  Many trees were damaged there as well.  The sixth and final tornado briefly touched down near the intersection of Highway 82 and 13 in Adams County.  Mobile homes were damaged, along with nearby trees.  Richland and Vernon County were declared federal disaster areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Cooler and drier air was to the north of the front, with very warm and unstable air to the south.  Dew point temperatures approached 70 to the south of the boundary during the morning hours of the 8th.  A short wave tracked southeast across the area in a general northwest flow.  The air mass became quite unstable in the vicinity of the boundary with lifted indices around -7 C.  The shear profile was favorable with about 40 kts of shear in the lower layers.  Plenty of deep moisture was available with the system with precipitable water values in the 1.5 to 1.8 inch range.  Hail was somewhat limited with the storms, but not absent with freezing levels in the 12,500 to 13,000 foot range.  CAPE values ahead of the storms were in the 1500 to 2000 J/kg range, with CAPE in the -10 C to -30 C layer of the atmosphere in the 400 J/kg range.  Thunderstorms which began well to the northwest during the previous night tracked southeast into Iowa during the morning of the 8th.  A steady flow of moisture was transported into the area with a feed at 850 mb of about 25 kts.  The storms were fast moving and the area tended to bow out.  Wind damage was wide spread with numerous reports of winds of 60 to 70 MPH.  An intense cluster of storms moved through the central Iowa area with measured wind gusts of 83 MPH reported at both Ames and Ankeny with the gust front passage.  There was one reported tornado with the system in Ames.  The tornado touched down near the power plant o nthe ISU Campus.  Eight people were injured by the tornado.  One was injured seriously enough to be taken to hospital.  Initial damage estimates were around $150,000.  Many of the storms produced hail, however much of the hail was below severe limits. Reports of penny size hail were received from several locations.   The largest hail came with the cluster in central Iowa.  Golf ball size hail fell west of Elkhart in Polk County.  The storm and high winds resulted in power outages to 8700 customers in the Des Moines area.  The high winds caused a semi-tractortrailer and a camper to oberturn on INterstate 80 just west of exit 141 in Polk County.  The thunderstorms also produced locally heavy rainfall.

A strong upper level system moved through the area with mid and upper level winds in the 70 to 90 kt range.  Low level winds of 35 to 50 kts transported moisture north into the system.  High temperatures reached the mid 60s to low 70s, with dew point readings approaching 60 by late afternoon.  A surface low developed over northern Kansas during the previous night and lifted northeast into eastern South Dakota during the afternoon of the 12th, then into central Minnesota as a 985 mb low by late evening.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with CAPE values reaching 1000 J/kg by late afternoon.  The Lifted Index values were in the -5 C. range.  Being as it was in November, the freezing level was quite low during the event, in the 10,000 to 11,000 foot range.  Though the soundings were quite unidirectional, there was plenty of shear with zero to 6 km shear values around 65 kts. Thunderstorms erupted during the afternoon in west central in to southwest Iowa.  The storms became severe quite quickly.  Initially the storms produce quarter to golf ball size hail, with 2 1/2 inch diameter hail falling in Dallas County.  Hail up to baseball size fell in Greene County as well.  The system transitioned into a tornadic system within an hour with several tornadoes touching down in the central sections of the state.  At least 9 communities were hit by tornadoes and 65 homes damaged or destroyed.  An 82 year old woman was killed in Stratford when the tornado demolished her home.  In a 2 or 3 block area of downtown Woodward, at least 12 houses were totally destroyed.  There was one minor injury in Ames,  two serious injuries in the Woodward area, and three injuries in Stratford.  Due to the extensive damage to property caused by the tornadoes, Iowa Governor Vilsack declared Boone, Story, Webster, Dallas and Hamilton Counties disaster areas.A long-lived tornado tracked through several counties across central Iowa during the late afternoon hours of Nov. 12, 2005.  The tornado path is estimated at 27.5 miles long and between 100 and 150 yards wide along the damage path.Tornado (1) initially touched down just west of E Avenue (just south of Boxholm in northwest Boone county), one half mile south of Boone County Highway E18 at approximately 4:27 p.m as an F1 tornado.  The tornado then tracked northeast across E Avenue, hitting a farm just north of E18, damaging the home and some out buildings.  It also flipped over one pickup truck and killed two horses at this location.The tornado continued northeast, spreading debris across F Avenue just north of 125th Street as it maintained F1 intensity.  Two additional homes were damaged with outbuildings destroyed as the tornado tracked northeast across G and H Avenues near 105th Avenue.  It then intensified to an F2 tornado as it crossed the Boone/Webster county line.  Another home was heavily damaged and a large outbuilding destroyed just north of the Boone/Webster county line.  The tornado quickly moved northeast, crossing 390th Street and headed toward the Des Moines River, weakening to an F1 tornado.A continuous, but weak damage path was observed crossing the river as the tornado tracked across open farmland and land adjacent the Des Moines River.  The tornado has been rated an F1 tornado during this time.  After crossing County D64 in Webster county, the tornado struck another farm near 370th Street and Washington Avenue, damaging the residence and destroying a machine shed along with most of its contents.  The tornado again intensified to an F2 at this location.The tornado then headed toward Stratford, crossing the Webster and Hamilton county line just west of County Road D54.  The tornado entered Stratford at 4:46 p.m. on the west-central end of town, heavily damaging many homes.  The tornado crossed the city park and then exited the city near the north-central portion of Stratford.  Numerous homes were heavily damaged with one fatality.As the tornado left Stratford, it continued on a northeast track, lifting and dropping to the ground several times as an F0 and F1 tornado.  It damaged three additional farms northeast of Stratford with the last damaged farm north of 320th Street and west of County Road R21 in Hamilton County.Tornado (2) touched down one mile west of Minburn in Dallas County  according to the aerial survey.  The tornado tracked northeast for about eight miles, producing F0-F1 damage before intensifying near Highway 141.  The tornado produced F2 damage at a farm one mile southwest of Woodward, and continued to produce F2 damage through the south and east portions of Woodward.  The tornado dissipated one mile northeast of Woodward.  Severe houses slid off their foundations in Woodward, and a double-wide home was flipped upside down into the street.  Total path length was 11 miles.Tornado (3) touched down in open fields one mile northwest of Madrid.  It hit a home three miles north of Madrid on Highway 17, producing F1 damage.  One other farm site sustained damage as the tornado moved northeast.  The tornado dissipated after a six mile track.Tornado (4) started just west of Ames near the Highway 30 and Lincoln Way Split, according to the aerial survey.  The tornado produced F1-F2 damage on the northwest fringe of Ames.  It weakened as it moved northeast, before intensifying again and produced F2 damage to a farm site just south of Gilbert.  F1 damage occurred as the tornado crossed highway 69.  The tornado dissipated three miles south of Story City after a 10 mile track.Tornado (5) was a short-lived satellite tornado that was on the ground for 1.6 miles ending at the southwest edge of Story City.  The aerial survey showed very minor damage.Tornado (6) developed one mile west of Roland and tracked across the extreme southeast corner of Hamilton county before entering Hardin county.  The tornado produced damage up to F1 intensity to rural farm sites in far northern Story county and five miles south of Radcliffe in Hardin county.  The KCCI-TV aerial survey indicated the track was nine miles in length.Tornado (7) was a brief touchdown just south of Williams in Hamilton County.  No damage was found from this brief tornado and it is not shown here.Tornado (8) was briefly sighted near Blakesburg in Monroe County.  The tornado produced minor damage to a farm building but was not surveyed.Tornado (9) touched down briefly north of Steamboat Rock in Hardin County.  The tornado caused little damage.Tornado (10) was actually the first tornado of the day.  It formed from the same supercell that eventually moved northeast into the Stratford area.  The tornado caused little damage as it moved through fields south of the Scranton Area.Tornado (11) was a brief touchdown on the southwest edge of the Ames City limits.  This tornado was from the same parent cell as the previous tornado that touched down in Ames, but was distinct.  The tornado was weak and lifted lawn chairs and caused some shingle damage.  This tornado was ANTICYCLONIC in nature.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Tornado moved from Boone County into Story County.

A surface low developed over northern Kansas during the previous night and lifted northeast into eastern South Dakota during the afternoon of the 12th, then into central Minnesota as a 985 mb low by late evening.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with CAPE values reaching 1000 J/kg by late afternoon.  The Lifted Index values were in the -5 C. range.  Being as it was in November, the freezing level was quite low during the event, in the 10,000 to 11,000 foot range.  Though the soundings were quite unidirectional, there was plenty of shear with zero to 6 km shear values around 65 kts. Thunderstorms erupted during the afternoon in west central in to southwest Iowa.  The storms became severe quite quickly.  Initially the storms produce quarter to golf ball size hail, with 2 1/2 inch diameter hail falling in Dallas County.  Hail up to baseball size fell in Greene County as well.  The system transitioned into a tornadic system within an hour with several tornadoes touching down in the central sections of the state.  At least 9 communities were hit by tornadoes and 65 homes damaged or destroyed.  An 82 year old woman was killed in Stratford when the tornado demolished her home.  In a 2 or 3 block area of downtown Woodward, at least 12 houses were totally destroyed.  There was one minor injury in Ames,  two serious injuries in the Woodward area, and three injuries in Stratford.  Due to the extensive damage to property caused by the tornadoes, Iowa Governor Vilsack declared Boone, Story, Webster, Dallas and Hamilton Counties disaster areas.A long-lived tornado tracked through several counties across central Iowa during the late afternoon hours of Nov. 12, 2005.  The tornado path is estimated at 27.5 miles long and between 100 and 150 yards wide along the damage path.Tornado (1) initially touched down just west of E Avenue (just south of Boxholm in northwest Boone county), one half mile south of Boone County Highway E18 at approximately 4:27 p.m as an F1 tornado.  The tornado then tracked northeast across E Avenue, hitting a farm just north of E18, damaging the home and some out buildings.  It also flipped over one pickup truck and killed two horses at this location.The tornado continued northeast, spreading debris across F Avenue just north of 125th Street as it maintained F1 intensity.  Two additional homes were damaged with outbuildings destroyed as the tornado tracked northeast across G and H Avenues near 105th Avenue.  It then intensified to an F2 tornado as it crossed the Boone/Webster county line.  Another home was heavily damaged and a large outbuilding destroyed just north of the Boone/Webster county line.  The tornado quickly moved northeast, crossing 390th Street and headed toward the Des Moines River, weakening to an F1 tornado.A continuous, but weak damage path was observed crossing the river as the tornado tracked across open farmland and land adjacent the Des Moines River.  The tornado has been rated an F1 tornado during this time.  After crossing County D64 in Webster county, the tornado struck another farm near 370th Street and Washington Avenue, damaging the residence and destroying a machine shed along with most of its contents.  The tornado again intensified to an F2 at this location.The tornado then headed toward Stratford, crossing the Webster and Hamilton county line just west of County Road D54.  The tornado entered Stratford at 4:46 p.m. on the west-central end of town, heavily damaging many homes.  The tornado crossed the city park and then exited the city near the north-central portion of Stratford.  Numerous homes were heavily damaged with one fatality.As the tornado left Stratford, it continued on a northeast track, lifting and dropping to the ground several times as an F0 and F1 tornado.  It damaged three additional farms northeast of Stratford with the last damaged farm north of 320th Street and west of County Road R21 in Hamilton County.Tornado (2) touched down one mile west of Minburn in Dallas County  according to the aerial survey.  The tornado tracked northeast for about eight miles, producing F0-F1 damage before intensifying near Highway 141.  The tornado produced F2 damage at a farm one mile southwest of Woodward, and continued to produce F2 damage through the south and east portions of Woodward.  The tornado dissipated one mile northeast of Woodward.  Severe houses slid off their foundations in Woodward, and a double-wide home was flipped upside down into the street.  Total path length was 11 miles.Tornado (3) touched down in open fields one mile northwest of Madrid.  It hit a home three miles north of Madrid on Highway 17, producing F1 damage.  One other farm site sustained damage as the tornado moved northeast.  The tornado dissipated after a six mile track.Tornado (4) started just west of Ames near the Highway 30 and Lincoln Way Split, according to the aerial survey.  The tornado produced F1-F2 damage on the northwest fringe of Ames.  It weakened as it moved northeast, before intensifying again and produced F2 damage to a farm site just south of Gilbert.  F1 damage occurred as the tornado crossed highway 69.  The tornado dissipated three miles south of Story City after a 10 mile track.Tornado (5) was a short-lived satellite tornado that was on the ground for 1.6 miles ending at the southwest edge of Story City.  The aerial survey showed very minor damage.Tornado (6) developed one mile west of Roland and tracked across the extreme southeast corner of Hamilton county before entering Hardin county.  The tornado produced damage up to F1 intensity to rural farm sites in far northern Story county and five miles south of Radcliffe in Hardin county.  The KCCI-TV aerial survey indicated the track was nine miles in length.Tornado (7) was a brief touchdown just south of Williams in Hamilton County.  No damage was found from this brief tornado and it is not shown here.Tornado (8) was briefly sighted near Blakesburg in Monroe County.  The tornado produced minor damage to a farm building but was not surveyed.Tornado (9) touched down briefly north of Steamboat Rock in Hardin County.  The tornado caused little damage.Tornado (10) was actually the first tornado of the day.  It formed from the same supercell that eventually moved northeast into the Stratford area.  The tornado caused little damage as it moved through fields south of the Scranton Area.Tornado (11) was a brief touchdown on the southwest edge of the Ames City limits.  This tornado was from the same parent cell as the previous tornado that touched down in Ames, but was distinct.  The tornado was weak and lifted lawn chairs and caused some shingle damage.  This tornado was ANTICYCLONIC in nature.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Tornado moved from Boone County into Story County.

A strong upper level system moved through the area with mid and upper level winds in the 70 to 90 kt range.  Low level winds of 35 to 50 kts transported moisture north into the system.  High temperatures reached the mid 60s to low 70s, with dew point readings approaching 60 by late afternoon.  A surface low developed over northern Kansas during the previous night and lifted northeast into eastern South Dakota during the afternoon of the 12th, then into central Minnesota as a 985 mb low by late evening.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with CAPE values reaching 1000 J/kg by late afternoon.  The Lifted Index values were in the -5 C. range.  Being as it was in November, the freezing level was quite low during the event, in the 10,000 to 11,000 foot range.  Though the soundings were quite unidirectional, there was plenty of shear with zero to 6 km shear values around 65 kts. Thunderstorms erupted during the afternoon in west central in to southwest Iowa.  The storms became severe quite quickly.  Initially the storms produce quarter to golf ball size hail, with 2 1/2 inch diameter hail falling in Dallas County.  Hail up to baseball size fell in Greene County as well.  The system transitioned into a tornadic system within an hour with several tornadoes touching down in the central sections of the state.  At least 9 communities were hit by tornadoes and 65 homes damaged or destroyed.  An 82 year old woman was killed in Stratford when the tornado demolished her home.  In a 2 or 3 block area of downtown Woodward, at least 12 houses were totally destroyed.  There was one minor injury in Ames,  two serious injuries in the Woodward area, and three injuries in Stratford.  Due to the extensive damage to property caused by the tornadoes, Iowa Governor Vilsack declared Boone, Story, Webster, Dallas and Hamilton Counties disaster areas.A long-lived tornado tracked through several counties across central Iowa during the late afternoon hours of Nov. 12, 2005.  The tornado path is estimated at 27.5 miles long and between 100 and 150 yards wide along the damage path.Tornado (1) initially touched down just west of E Avenue (just south of Boxholm in northwest Boone county), one half mile south of Boone County Highway E18 at approximately 4:27 p.m as an F1 tornado.  The tornado then tracked northeast across E Avenue, hitting a farm just north of E18, damaging the home and some out buildings.  It also flipped over one pickup truck and killed two horses at this location.The tornado continued northeast, spreading debris across F Avenue just north of 125th Street as it maintained F1 intensity.  Two additional homes were damaged with outbuildings destroyed as the tornado tracked northeast across G and H Avenues near 105th Avenue.  It then intensified to an F2 tornado as it crossed the Boone/Webster county line.  Another home was heavily damaged and a large outbuilding destroyed just north of the Boone/Webster county line.  The tornado quickly moved northeast, crossing 390th Street and headed toward the Des Moines River, weakening to an F1 tornado.A continuous, but weak damage path was observed crossing the river as the tornado tracked across open farmland and land adjacent the Des Moines River.  The tornado has been rated an F1 tornado during this time.  After crossing County D64 in Webster county, the tornado struck another farm near 370th Street and Washington Avenue, damaging the residence and destroying a machine shed along with most of its contents.  The tornado again intensified to an F2 at this location.The tornado then headed toward Stratford, crossing the Webster and Hamilton county line just west of County Road D54.  The tornado entered Stratford at 4:46 p.m. on the west-central end of town, heavily damaging many homes.  The tornado crossed the city park and then exited the city near the north-central portion of Stratford.  Numerous homes were heavily damaged with one fatality.As the tornado left Stratford, it continued on a northeast track, lifting and dropping to the ground several times as an F0 and F1 tornado.  It damaged three additional farms northeast of Stratford with the last damaged farm north of 320th Street and west of County Road R21 in Hamilton County.Tornado (2) touched down one mile west of Minburn in Dallas County  according to the aerial survey.  The tornado tracked northeast for about eight miles, producing F0-F1 damage before intensifying near Highway 141.  The tornado produced F2 damage at a farm one mile southwest of Woodward, and continued to produce F2 damage through the south and east portions of Woodward.  The tornado dissipated one mile northeast of Woodward.  Severe houses slid off their foundations in Woodward, and a double-wide home was flipped upside down into the street.  Total path length was 11 miles.Tornado (3) touched down in open fields one mile northwest of Madrid.  It hit a home three miles north of Madrid on Highway 17, producing F1 damage.  One other farm site sustained damage as the tornado moved northeast.  The tornado dissipated after a six mile track.Tornado (4) started just west of Ames near the Highway 30 and Lincoln Way Split, according to the aerial survey.  The tornado produced F1-F2 damage on the northwest fringe of Ames.  It weakened as it moved northeast, before intensifying again and produced F2 damage to a farm site just south of Gilbert.  F1 damage occurred as the tornado crossed highway 69.  The tornado dissipated three miles south of Story City after a 10 mile track.Tornado (5) was a short-lived satellite tornado that was on the ground for 1.6 miles ending at the southwest edge of Story City.  The aerial survey showed very minor damage.Tornado (6) developed one mile west of Roland and tracked across the extreme southeast corner of Hamilton county before entering Hardin county.  The tornado produced damage up to F1 intensity to rural farm sites in far northern Story county and five miles south of Radcliffe in Hardin county.  The KCCI-TV aerial survey indicated the track was nine miles in length.Tornado (7) was a brief touchdown just south of Williams in Hamilton County.  No damage was found from this brief tornado and it is not shown here.Tornado (8) was briefly sighted near Blakesburg in Monroe County.  The tornado produced minor damage to a farm building but was not surveyed.Tornado (9) touched down briefly north of Steamboat Rock in Hardin County.  The tornado caused little damage.Tornado (10) was actually the first tornado of the day.  It formed from the same supercell that eventually moved northeast into the Stratford area.  The tornado caused little damage as it moved through fields south of the Scranton Area.Tornado (11) was a brief touchdown on the southwest edge of the Ames City limits.  This tornado was from the same parent cell as the previous tornado that touched down in Ames, but was distinct.  The tornado was weak and lifted lawn chairs and caused some shingle damage.

A strong upper level system moved through the area with mid and upper level winds in the 70 to 90 kt range.  Low level winds of 35 to 50 kts transported moisture north into the system.  High temperatures reached the mid 60s to low 70s, with dew point readings approaching 60 by late afternoon.  A surface low developed over northern Kansas during the previous night and lifted northeast into eastern South Dakota during the afternoon of the 12th, then into central Minnesota as a 985 mb low by late evening.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with CAPE values reaching 1000 J/kg by late afternoon.  The Lifted Index values were in the -5 C. range.  Being as it was in November, the freezing level was quite low during the event, in the 10,000 to 11,000 foot range.  Though the soundings were quite unidirectional, there was plenty of shear with zero to 6 km shear values around 65 kts. Thunderstorms erupted during the afternoon in west central in to southwest Iowa.  The storms became severe quite quickly.  Initially the storms produce quarter to golf ball size hail, with 2 1/2 inch diameter hail falling in Dallas County.  Hail up to baseball size fell in Greene County as well.  The system transitioned into a tornadic system within an hour with several tornadoes touching down in the central sections of the state.  At least 9 communities were hit by tornadoes and 65 homes damaged or destroyed.  An 82 year old woman was killed in Stratford when the tornado demolished her home.  In a 2 or 3 block area of downtown Woodward, at least 12 houses were totally destroyed.  There was one minor injury in Ames,  two serious injuries in the Woodward area, and three injuries in Stratford.  Due to the extensive damage to property caused by the tornadoes, Iowa Governor Vilsack declared Boone, Story, Webster, Dallas and Hamilton Counties disaster areas.A long-lived tornado tracked through several counties across central Iowa during the late afternoon hours of Nov. 12, 2005.  The tornado path is estimated at 27.5 miles long and between 100 and 150 yards wide along the damage path.Tornado (1) initially touched down just west of E Avenue (just south of Boxholm in northwest Boone county), one half mile south of Boone County Highway E18 at approximately 4:27 p.m as an F1 tornado.  The tornado then tracked northeast across E Avenue, hitting a farm just north of E18, damaging the home and some out buildings.  It also flipped over one pickup truck and killed two horses at this location.The tornado continued northeast, spreading debris across F Avenue just north of 125th Street as it maintained F1 intensity.  Two additional homes were damaged with outbuildings destroyed as the tornado tracked northeast across G and H Avenues near 105th Avenue.  It then intensified to an F2 tornado as it crossed the Boone/Webster county line.  Another home was heavily damaged and a large outbuilding destroyed just north of the Boone/Webster county line.  The tornado quickly moved northeast, crossing 390th Street and headed toward the Des Moines River, weakening to an F1 tornado.A continuous, but weak damage path was observed crossing the river as the tornado tracked across open farmland and land adjacent the Des Moines River.  The tornado has been rated an F1 tornado during this time.  After crossing County D64 in Webster county, the tornado struck another farm near 370th Street and Washington Avenue, damaging the residence and destroying a machine shed along with most of its contents.  The tornado again intensified to an F2 at this location.The tornado then headed toward Stratford, crossing the Webster and Hamilton county line just west of County Road D54.  The tornado entered Stratford at 4:46 p.m. on the west-central end of town, heavily damaging many homes.  The tornado crossed the city park and then exited the city near the north-central portion of Stratford.  Numerous homes were heavily damaged with one fatality.As the tornado left Stratford, it continued on a northeast track, lifting and dropping to the ground several times as an F0 and F1 tornado.  It damaged three additional farms northeast of Stratford with the last damaged farm north of 320th Street and west of County Road R21 in Hamilton County.Tornado (2) touched down one mile west of Minburn in Dallas County  according to the aerial survey.  The tornado tracked northeast for about eight miles, producing F0-F1 damage before intensifying near Highway 141.  The tornado produced F2 damage at a farm one mile southwest of Woodward, and continued to produce F2 damage through the south and east portions of Woodward.  The tornado dissipated one mile northeast of Woodward.  Severe houses slid off their foundations in Woodward, and a double-wide home was flipped upside down into the street.  Total path length was 11 miles.Tornado (3) touched down in open fields one mile northwest of Madrid.  It hit a home three miles north of Madrid on Highway 17, producing F1 damage.  One other farm site sustained damage as the tornado moved northeast.  The tornado dissipated after a six mile track.Tornado (4) started just west of Ames near the Highway 30 and Lincoln Way Split, according to the aerial survey.  The tornado produced F1-F2 damage on the northwest fringe of Ames.  It weakened as it moved northeast, before intensifying again and produced F2 damage to a farm site just south of Gilbert.  F1 damage occurred as the tornado crossed highway 69.  The tornado dissipated three miles south of Story City after a 10 mile track.Tornado (5) was a short-lived satellite tornado that was on the ground for 1.6 miles ending at the southwest edge of Story City.  The aerial survey showed very minor damage.Tornado (6) developed one mile west of Roland and tracked across the extreme southeast corner of Hamilton county before entering Hardin county.  The tornado produced damage up to F1 intensity to rural farm sites in far northern Story county and five miles south of Radcliffe in Hardin county.  The KCCI-TV aerial survey indicated the track was nine miles in length.Tornado (7) was a brief touchdown just south of Williams in Hamilton County.  No damage was found from this brief tornado and it is not shown here.Tornado (8) was briefly sighted near Blakesburg in Monroe County.  The tornado produced minor damage to a farm building but was not surveyed.Tornado (9) touched down briefly north of Steamboat Rock in Hardin County.  The tornado caused little damage.Tornado (10) was actually the first tornado of the day.  It formed from the same supercell that eventually moved northeast into the Stratford area.  The tornado caused little damage as it moved through fields south of the Scranton Area.Tornado (11) was a brief touchdown on the southwest edge of the Ames City limits.  This tornado was from the same parent cell as the previous tornado that touched down in Ames, but was distinct.  The tornado was weak and lifted lawn chairs and caused some shingle damage.  This tornado was ANTICYCLONIC in nature.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Tornado moved from Dallas County into Boone County.

This second crossing was from Vanderburgh County, Indiana into Henderson County. The tornado then crossed the river a third time less than a mile west of the U.S. Highway 41 twin bridges. The river does not form the state line at the third crossing. From the bridges, extensive tree damage was visible along both sides of the Ohio River. Almost immediately after crossing the river, the tornado slammed into a horse racing facility named Ellis Park. There was extensive damage to grandstands and housing facilities for jockeys. A few race horses were killed. This facility was the first major facility to be impacted by the tornado. All of the Henderson County tornado injuries were at Ellis Park. The tornado then crossed back into Vanderburgh County, Indiana after striking Ellis Park.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado was on the ground for 3 miles in Concordia parish before it moved into Tensas parish. The damage in Clayton and just to the northeast was confined to a few trees uprooted and snapped with one tree landing on a mobile home causing 1 injury. The tornado became more intense as it moved across southern Tensas parish. The tornado tracked nearly 6 miles across swamp land before it slammed into a small church on Highway 566. The church was totally destroyed as it was blown off its pillars and deposited in a tree and across the Highway. After traveling across more fields for 2 miles the tornado hit the "Thunderbird House". Here the tornado was at its peak intensity and caused the most significant damage. All the trees on the property were uprooted and mangled, a john boat was wrapped in a tree like tin foil and the large barn in the back yard was totally destroyed. The large house had its second story torn off and deposited 1/4 to 1/2 a mile down the path. This house was around 100 years old, between 5000-6000 sq ft and firmly built. The tornado picked the house up and moved it 4 feet and tore off 2 of the side walls. Additionally, both vehicles in the driveway were moved some 10-15 feet and heavily damaged by debris. The tornado continued to the northeast were it destroyed another home blowing off the roof and all the exterior walls. At this location, a car was picked up and flipped over onto a pile of downed trees. A house on the edge of the path had widows blown out and part of the roof blown off.This tornado had a total path length of 14 miles across Concordia and Tensas parishes. Overall the tornado was not very wide but it was very intense. Fortunately, the tornado moved across a sparsely populated and rural area keeping significant damage to a minimum.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the tornado moved quickly northeast across Marshall County, it reached its peak intensity of 200 MPH as it approached the Kentucky Lake resort campgrounds and boatyards. Until the tornado reached U.S. Highway 641 south of Benton, mostly F-1 damage occurred. Garages and barns sustained varying degrees of damage, and numerous trees were down. The most serious damage, ranging up to F-3 intensity, occurred from Big Bear Highway to Moor's Resort on Kentucky Lake. The occupant of a destroyed mobile home was killed in this area. The mobile home was thrown 40 feet and overturned before catching fire. At Moor's Resort, a year-round camping area was struck directly. A total of 115 RV's were destroyed, and the campground was devastated. A dock was demolished, taking a number of boats with it. Although the harbor and campground were destroyed, cabins and other lodging facilities outside of the tornado path were untouched. The average path width of this tornado was 275 yards, but it grew to a maximum of 500 yards in Marshall County.

As the tornado moved quickly northeast across Marshall County, it reached its peak intensity of 200 MPH as it approached the Kentucky Lake resort campgrounds and boatyards. Until the tornado reached U.S. Highway 641 south of Benton, mostly F-1 damage occurred. Garages and barns sustained varying degrees of damage, and numerous trees were down. The most serious damage, ranging up to F-3 intensity, occurred from Big Bear Highway to Moor's Resort on Kentucky Lake. The occupant of a destroyed mobile home was killed in this area. The mobile home was thrown 40 feet and overturned before catching fire. At Moor's Resort, a year-round camping area was struck directly. A total of 115 RV's were destroyed, and the campground was devastated. A dock was demolished, taking a number of boats with it. Although the harbor and campground were destroyed, cabins and other lodging facilities outside of the tornado path were untouched. The average path width of this tornado was 275 yards, but it grew to a maximum of 500 yards in Marshall County. In Marshall County, approximately 19 homes were destroyed, 36 suffered major damage, and 65 received minor damage. The tornado then moved over Kentucky Lake and crossed into Lyon County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One strongly rotating supercell produced three tornadoes, two of them rated strong F3, over southern portions of central Indiana.

No one was killed by this powerful tornado, despite areas of severe damage, and only one minor injury was reported.  A resident sustained an ankle injury when moving quickly down into his basement with his family to take cover.  The worst damage along the tornado's path took place along and near Vandalia Road just east of the town of Geneva, where a large hog farm was severely damaged, and an old farm house was blown off its foundation.

A total of 5.47 inches of rain was recorded in Wanamingo in 24 hours, 2.8 inches of which fell between 9:30 and 10:30 PM.  An unnamed creek which flows into the North Fork Zumbro River rose 20 feet above its normal 1 foot level and rushed over Highway 1 about 1 mile south of the Highway 30 intersection in Wanamingo Township, about 4 miles west of Wanamingo. By 10:30 PM the creek completed covered the road in rushing water up to 2.5 feet deep and shortly thereafter two separate vehicles were swept off the roadway and were washed down the creek.  One vehicle, a pickup truck, was found in a nearby ditch with a smashed windshield and badly damaged hood.  The body of the driver, a 47-year-old man, was found three quarters of a mile downstream under farm equipment nearly a day and a half later when the water finally subsided. The man, who lived in Hayfield, was on his way to work in Cannon Falls.  The other vehicle that was washed off the road and into the creek was a sedan. The driver, a 50-year-old Kenyon woman who was on her way home from work, exited the car through an open window after traveling about ½ mile downstream. She floated on her back down the creek until lightning illuminated a nearby fencepost which she grabbed hold of until rescuers arrived two hours later.  Incredibly she survived the ordeal with only bruises. The rushing creek was also responsible for washing out 200 feet of gradual slope along Highway 1 near the road. Scattered debris was also found in farm fields along the creek's banks for several miles.  In addition, an unnamed creek that flows into the North Fork Zumbro River about 2 miles east of Wanamingo inundated the Shades of Sherwood campground around 10:30 PM.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The heaviest rains fell on the northeastern quadrant of the city where extensive flash flooding occurred.  As much as three inches of rain fell between 3 and 4:30 pm as thunderstorms trained over the same small area.  An elderly couple was killed around 4:15 pm after they drove their automobile into a flooded underpass on State Route 611 (Henderson Road) just a couple blocks east of State Route 57 (Broadway).  The underpass filled with more than 12 feet of water in just a few minutes.  Efforts to rescue the couple were unsuccessful.  An automated rain gage just south of the underpass recorded 2.56 inches of rain between 3 and 4 pm and a total of 2.76 inches by 4:30 pm.  A second underpass on State Route 57 (East 28th Street) was flooded by as much as ten feet of water.  Much of Broadway Road was reported to be flowing "like a river" during the peak of the storm.  Severe flooding was reported on most of the major thoroughfares in the northeastern portion of Lorain including Elyria Road, North Ridge Road, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Oberlin Avenue.   Flood waters on Elyria Road were as much as six feet deep with two to three feet of flowing water reported at other locations.  Dozens of vehicles became stranded in the flood waters and rescue efforts were severely hampered by the widespread nature of the flooding.  Industrial areas south and west of the Black River were inundated by flood waters.  Damage to homes and business in the City of Lorain and Sheffield Township from both flash flooding and basement flooding was extensive.   At least 14 families were displaced by flooding.   At least five City of Lorain police cars were destroyed by flooding.  Flooding also was reported along Beaver Creek on the west side of Lorain.  The creek left it's bank and damaged several homes.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.2M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The 24 hour amount ending on the 20th was 2.23 inches.  Water rose mostly into yards and garages with debris left on fences.  Two homes had major damage.  Two other houses sustained minor damage.  One Chattaroy woman was slightly injured when she lost her footing, slipped into the stream, and went through a culvert.  Small private bridges were also damaged.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 225K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The teenagers were scrambling to get into two Ford F-250 pickup trucks when they were struck by the wall of water.  Five of the teenagers were unable to get into a vehicle when the water struck and were carried some distance downstream along Dry Fork Creek.  Two of the teenagers were carried all the way down to Piceance Creek near the intersection of County Road 22 and County Road 5 where they were rescued by County Road and Bridge employees who had just completed cleaning debris off County Road 5 from an earlier flash flood.  Both DOW pickup trucks were rolled by the flash flood waters and were totalled.

Storm totals averaged from four to six inches with amounts exceeding eight inches toward the Lehigh Valley. The heavy rain caused widespread poor drainage flooding as well as flooding along the smaller creeks in the county. The flooding also resulted in the death of a 19-year-old woman in Milford Township. She lost control of her vehicle while trying to cross a flooded road over the Molasses Creek. Her vehicle hit a guardrail and flipped into the flooded creek. Dozens of roads were impassable with the greatest reported closures in Lower Makefield, Bridgeton and New Hope. The Neshaminy Creek at Langhorne was above its 9 foot flood stage from 1026 p.m. EDT on the 8th through 828 a.m. EDT on the 9th. It crested at 11.74 feet at 445 a.m. EDT on the 9th. Flooding also occurred early that evening at the confluence of the Neshaminy Creek and Delaware River in Bristol and Bensalem Townships at the time of the high tide. Storm totals included 7.52 inches in Sellersville, 6.32 inches in Furlong, 6.01 inches in Doylestown, 5.99 inches in Perkasie, 5.98 inches in Neshaminy Falls and 4.44 inches in Southampton. This heavy rain helped the state of Pennsylvania have its second wettest October on record dating back to 1895. The statewide average precipitation total was 6.49 inches, 3.31 inches wetter than normal. Only 1976 (6.59 inches) was wetter. October 2005 was the wettest October on record at the Philadelphia International Airport with a precipitation total of 8.68 inches, 5.93 inches wetter than normal and surpassed the previous record by 2.02 inches. The cold front moved from near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at 8 p.m. EDT on the 7th, to the Susquehanna Valley in Pennsylvania at 2 a.m. EDT on the 8th, to the Poconos and Berks County in Pennsylvania and just west of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland at 8 a.m. EDT on the 8th. The cold front stalled as waves of low pressure road northeast along it. At 2 p.m. EDT on the 8th, the cold front just edged into northwestern New Jersey and the Philadelphia northwest suburbs and was still west of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. At 8 p.m. EDT that evening the cold front barely moved into the Philadelphia New Jersey suburbs and the Delmarva Peninsula. The cold front and waves of low pressure cleared the Delaware and New Jersey coasts between Midnight EDT and 2 a.m. EDT on the 9th. The slow movement and stalling coupled with an unstable air mass and tropical moisture associated with Tammy helped enhance the torrential downpours. The flooding would have been even worse if not for the unseasonably dry weather that preceded this event from the middle of August.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Storm total rainfall ranged from between 9 and 11 inches across southwest New Hampshire; and the worst flooding occurred in the Ashuelot River basin, where the community of Alstead lies.  Approximately 1000 people were evacuated in southwest New Hampshire during these floods.The most destructive flooding occurred in Alstead, where there was loss of life, totally destroyed homes and businesses, and numerous bridge washouts.  At approximately 6 AM EST, an estimated 20 to 30 foot flood wave resulted when an embankment failed.  This flood wave traveled down Warren Brook, destroying over one dozen homes, wiping out bridges, and severely damaging many other structures.  This flash flood scoured out numerous, large sections of route 123, and downed utility poles for a five mile stretch.  Downstream, this flooding took out an old double stone-arched bridge in Walpole along the Cold River.In Hinsdale, road washouts were observed with locally severe flood damage near downtown Hinsdale.  A culvert for Kilburn Brook became blocked with tree and rock debris late Saturday night and eventually gave way to wipe out a section of Main Street (Route 119), destroying an abandoned house.Two known fatalities resulted from this significant flood event.  One Alstead man was found dead in a cornfield near the Cold River in Langdon, succumbing to the Warren River culvert breach.  He did not leave his home after being told to evacuate.  A kayaker from Antrim was missing and presumed dead; he was last seen kayaking on the North Branch River in Antrim.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Drifts of golf ball size hail and heavy rain pounded York County as well. 	Flash flooding was reported in York and Polk counties. In York County, the underpass north of downtown was full of water and the Beaver Creek Trails on the west side of town flooded. In Polk County, there were several roads reported under water around 8 pm in eastern sections of the county. Heavy rain of 1 to 3 inches in eastern Nuckolls County caused damage to county roads around Ruskin and Hardy.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Baseball size hail pounded the vehicle of the Fillmore County Emergency Manager.
