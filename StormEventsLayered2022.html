Thunderstorms were most widespread on the 15th with several reports of hail as large as golf balls and numerous wind damage reports. A wind gust of 58 mph was recorded at the Jacksonville/LR Air Force Base.||Some relief (cooler air) came on the 15th in the form of a cold front. At the same time, there were strong to severe storms ahead of the front.  Storms were sure to thrive given an enormous amount of energy in place. Models showed a line of storms traversing the region from northwest to southeast during the afternoon, and these were expected to unleash strong to damaging winds. Updrafts into some storms were likely to be powerful enough to suspend hailstones aloft, and allow them to grow. So, very large hail was possible. There were already a few hailstorms on the 14th, with lime size hail at Jasper (Newton County), and golf ball size hail at Harrison (Boone County). Tornadoes were much less likely because steering winds were generally weak (30 knots or less), and there was not much shear.||Between 1100 am and 1200 pm CST, a large cluster of storms arrived from Missouri. Ahead of the cluster, isolated to scattered storms erupted mainly north and west of Little Rock (Pulaski County). Golf ball size hail was reported at Boxley (Newton County) and the west side of Russellville (Pope County). There was half dollar size hail at London and just north of Russellville (both in Pope County), and quarter size stones at Chickalah (Yell County), Nimrod (Perry County), and Paris (Logan County).||As the afternoon progressed, the cluster of storms worked from northwest into central and southeast Arkansas. Numerous trees and power lines were downed, with some trees on houses. At least 50,000 power outages were noted at one point. At Russellville (Pope County), a tree fell on a vehicle, and two people had to be extricated and taken to the hospital. A tree also came down on a travel trailer close to Hazen (Prairie County). Fallen trees blocked Highway 7 near Fourche Junction (Perry County), Highway 46 at Sheridan (Grant County), and Highway 54 at Sulphur Springs (Jefferson County). Roads were blocked by trees at a campground northeast of Fifty Six (Stone County). A roof was blown off of a storage building west of Hot Springs (Garland County).||There was a 58 mph gust at the Little Rock Air Force Base (Pulaski County), a 56 mph gust at McCreanor (Lonoke County), a 55 mph gust at Little Rock National Airport (Pulaski County), and a 54 mph gust at the Stuttgart Airport in Fairmount (Prairie County).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tree fell on a vehicle near East 4th Street in Russellville. Two people were extricated from the vehicle and taken to the local hospital.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Meanwhile, an upper trough dug through Western Texas and into the Southern Plains during the afternoon and evening hours of the 4th, enhancing large scale forcing along and ahead of a dry line that developed and spread east across North-central Texas. This resulted in shower and thunderstorm development which rapidly intensified over this area, which spread east into East Texas during the late evening through the early morning hours of the 4th-5th. Given the extent of instability and the strong southerly low level jet in place, these storms became severe as they spread east across East Texas and North Louisiana, resulting in numerous reports of damaging winds as these storms organized into a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) which quickly spread across the region through the pre-dawn hours. These storms exited East Texas shortly after 1 am on the 5th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A downburst affected much of the southern and eastern sections of the city of Whitehouse, resulting in numerous trees being snapped and uprooted along its path. The majority of the more significant damage occurred in an east-southeasterly direction, which began in the Willows subdivision just west of Willingham Road, where several small Bradford pear trees were snapped, and small areas of shingles were ripped from the roofs of a couple of homes with winds estimated in the range of 70-75 mph. The winds from this downburst intensified as it crossed Willingham Road, affecting several streets along and to the west of Highway 110. Here, numerous hardwood trees and large limbs were snapped and uprooted, with winds consistent of 90-95 mph. Trees fell on at least 4 homes in this area. The maximum winds near 100 mph from this downburst were estimated as it impacted the Whitehouse Mobile Home and RV Park, where multiple large trees were snapped and uprooted. Unfortunately, one fatality occurred here as a large pine tree fell onto an RV on Barbara Drive, killing a 71 year-old male sleeping inside. Additional large hardwood trees were downed along and to the north of Hagan Road, Railroad Avenue, before weakening as it entered the Waterton subdivision on East Main Street. It should be noted that wind damage was noted across much of Smith County and East Texas from these severe thunderstorms.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Despite fairly muggy dew points, the hot surface temperatures created inverted-V soundings that were primed for damaging wind potential. Thunderstorms came in three waves during the evening, as marginal shear values prohibited any long-lived or well-organized thunderstorms across the area.||Winds were measured by wind sensors at over 100 mph across portions of South Dakota, with a measured wind gust at Madison, Minnesota of 94 mph. There were also numerous measured wind gusts between 60 and 80 mph across west central and southwest Minnesota with embedded surges that produced a few tornadoes. The most concentrated area of damage based on reports of farm equipment, trailers, semis, trees, power lines, and other debris, occurred near the upper Minnesota River Valley, northward to Alexandria and Long Prairie.||Over Stevens County alone, structural damage was considerable as the majority of the damage was to farm outbuildings, sheds and grain bins. There were a few locations in the county where the main inhabited house or home structure did suffer loss of roof and siding and windows but those were more isolated in nature. Many locations had debris tossed a mile northeast from its parent location. Nearly 100% of the damage witnessed in Stevens county was consistent with a straight line wind event, with just one tornado crossing the southeast corner of the county.  ||Ten tornadoes were confirmed this day, with two in Lac Qui Parle County, including a house in Bellingham that had much of its roof removed.  In northwestern Swift County, a tornado tipped over trailers and various farm equipment was heavily damaged.  Two tornadoes were in Todd County, including one that moved through Clarissa.

With a very strong wave moving northeast through Nebraska into a highly unstable and highly sheared environment, scattered storms initiated and quickly grew upscale to a broad linear structure with damaging winds. With crop development well behind schedule and many fields yet to be planted, there was ample dirt available to be lofted into the leading edge of the storms, which took on the characteristics of a haboob reducing visibility to near zero at the onset of high winds.||A broad swath of winds from 70 to 100 mph devastated much of southeast South Dakota, and portions of southwest Minnesota, northeast Nebraska and northwest Iowa, causing extensive tree and structural damage and scores of injuries. The highest observed wind gust was 107 mph near Tripp, SD. In addition, vehicles and high profile vehicles were blown off several roads, shutting down traffic on Interstates 29 and 90. Two (direct) fatalities occurred in vehicles impacted by debris as the storms moved into the Sioux Falls area. Power was disrupted in a widespread area, with estimates of over 45,000 customers impacted at one time. Many schools were closed due to damage and power issues. The South Dakota Governor requested and was granted a Presidential Disaster Declaration for damage to public infrastructure at an estimated cost of 6.7 million dollars across 20 counties and two reservations. Private losses were a much higher toll, and just one of the impacted counties (McCook) estimated at least 150 to 175 million dollars in damage. Presidential Disaster Declarations were also granted in Dixon County, Nebraska and Lincoln County, Minnesota. ||Following the afternoon line of storms, a secondary band of storms developed near the core of the upper level jet across eastern Nebraska in the early evening hours. These storms also quickly become severe, with a mix of large hail, damaging wind, and even an isolated tornado near Sioux City.

Thunderstorms initially became organized across the Tri-Cities and northern Thumb during the early afternoon and brought widely scattered wind gusts between 50-60 mph, which resulted in numerous reports of downed trees and powerlines. Severe thunderstorms continued to expand southward during the late afternoon, while new storms developed just ahead of the initial line, along an expanding outflow boundary. Given the moderate to strong instability in place, thunderstorms continued to produce widely scattered damaging wind gusts as they approached the northern Metro region. A Mesoscale Convective Vortex (MCV) eventually caught up with the line in the evening hours which continued the threat of severe weather across the Detroit Metro region.

These upper level features tapped into a very hot, moist, and unstable air mass with the aid of diurnal heating, with widely scattered showers and thunderstorms developing across East Texas and North Louisiana.

Five buildings sustained shingle damage at the Pinehurst Apartment Complex, with the most intense damage occurring just west of the apartment complex along Pat Drive and Highway 80. Approximately 15 trees were snapped and around 30 trees were uprooted at this location. Further downstream to the west, trees were uprooted and large branches broken across the Longview Heights area, with the damage ending at the Memory Park Cemetery. One person was injured when a tree fell onto their vehicle in the Longview Heights area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Initial storms remained poorly organized, but did produce sporadic wind damage or hail. More substantial thunderstorm development evolved during the evening hours in northwestern Indiana and southwestern Lower Michigan and progressed east, eventually producing several swaths of wind damage. The most intense cluster of storms evolved in Berrien county Michigan and dropped rapidly southeast impacting locations extending from South Bend to Fort Wayne. Southwestern portions of Fort Wayne suffered the greatest impacts with widespread tree and structure damage from 80 to nearly 100 mph winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The swath of damaging winds existed southeastern Whitley county and begin to intensify further, impacting the Arcola area with numerous trees, tree limbs and power lines down, some onto structures. The damage continued southeast impacting the southwest portions of Fort Wayne and surrounding areas. The hardest hit areas extended from Aboite township into Indian Village and Waynedale. Tree and tree limb damage was extensive in some areas, causing difficulties in clearing of roadways and restoration of power as numerous power lines and poles were impacted either by the winds alone or falling trees and tree limbs. The Fox Island County Park area had to be closed for an extended period due to extensive tree damage on roads and paths. A 98 mph wind gust was recorded at the Fort Wayne Regional Airport. An 89 year old female was inside her home in the 5400 block of Mason Drive when a tree crashed into her home. She was severely injured by broken glass and passed away at a local hospital despite surgery to stop the bleeding early on the morning of June 14. The fatality was compounded by first responders being unable to reach her for an extended period of time due to the extensive tree and power line debris.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Large scale forcing increased along the dry line across Central Texas during the late afternoon through the evening, as these storms tapped moderate instability and increasing wind shear ahead of this system.

While these storms exited the region prior to daybreak on the 13th, additional showers and thunderstorms developed along the associated cold front across East Texas during the mid and late morning of the 13th, before spreading into North Louisiana during the peak heating of the afternoon.

The tree damage was near the EF-0 to EF-1 threshold for most of the track, with many more uproots and trunk snaps. However, near the end of the tornado along and north of Highway 139, the level of tree damage indicated a strengthening of the tornado, in particular along Trichel Lane. It was near the end of this road that approximately one hundred trees were snapped and uprooted, warranting a peak wind speed estimate of 110 mph, which is a high-end EF-1 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.

The survey suggested that the tornado was most intense in a narrower corridor from Highway 118 where it crossed McInnis Road, where damage indicators of several structures suggested EF-2 winds.

A dry line extended southward from the surface low through west Texas into the Big Bend Country along with a cold front draped southwest from the surface low into southeast New Mexico. Aloft, an upper-level low was initially centered just east of the Rockies in eastern Colorado before tracking into eastern Kansas and eventually into the Ozarks on the morning of May 6th. Meanwhile, the surface low shifted along the Red River Valley with the cold front trailing along the I-35 corridor, shifting farther east into the Ark-La-Tex region on the afternoon and evening of May 5th. As a result, an ongoing complex of showers and thunderstorms over Oklahoma strengthened as they moved into a more unstable environment during the afternoon ahead of the cold front and upper low, becoming strong to severe across portions of Southwest Arkansas, East Texas, and Northwest Louisiana. These storms also produced a few isolated tornadoes across portions of Rusk and Western Panola Counties, with localized flash flooding observed across portions of Upshur and Panola Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF-2 tornado with estimated maximum winds of 115 mph developed just west of County Road 222 on the east side of Henderson and continued northeast for just over eight miles, uprooting and snapping thousands of trees and causing damage to some structures. The tornado was at its widest and strongest crossing County Road 262, FM 1251 East, County Road 324, and County Road 327 where extensive snapping of pine and hardwood trees warranted an estimated peak wind speed of 115 mph, a low EF-2 rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. The one injury occurred along County Road 262 where a male outside was struck by a falling tree. Several residences received various levels of roof damage, mostly due to falling trees. The tornado weakened as it lifted west of Martin Lake, with the same storm spawning another tornado just to the east near Martin Lake.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A dry line extended southward from the surface low through west Texas into the Big Bend Country along with a cold front draped southwest from the surface low into southeast New Mexico. Aloft, an upper-level low was initially centered just east of the Rockies in eastern Colorado before tracking into eastern Kansas and eventually into the Ozarks on the morning of May 6th. Meanwhile, the surface low shifted along the Red River Valley with the cold front trailing along the I-35 corridor, shifting farther east into the Ark-La-Tex region on the afternoon and evening of May 5th. As a result, an ongoing complex of showers and thunderstorms over Oklahoma strengthened as they moved into a more unstable environment during the afternoon ahead of the cold front and upper low, becoming strong to severe across portions of Southwest Arkansas, East Texas, and Northwest Louisiana. These storms also produced a few isolated tornadoes across portions of Rusk and Western Panola Counties, with localized flash flooding observed across portions of Upshur and Panola Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF-2 tornado with estimated maximum winds of 115 mph developed just west of County Road 222 on the east side of Henderson and continued northeast for just over eight miles, uprooting and snapping thousands of trees and causing damage to some structures. The tornado was at its widest and strongest crossing County Road 262, FM 1251 East, County Road 324, and County Road 327 where extensive snapping of pine and hardwood trees warranted an estimated peak wind speed of 115 mph, a low EF-2 rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. The one injury occurred along County Road 262 where a male outside was struck by a falling tree. Several residences received various levels of roof damage, mostly due to falling trees. The tornado weakened as it lifted west of Martin Lake, with the same storm spawning another tornado just to the east near Martin Lake.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado is believed to have begun near Halsell Ranch Rd and Barton Chapel Road where tree damage was observed. The first significant damage noted was on Kinder Mountain Road where the blades of 4 wind turbines were shredded, significant tree damage was observed, and damage to a home and storage barns was observed. The winds were likely EF2 strength in this location. The tornado continued to be tracked to the northeast by observing mostly minor house/roof damage and notable tree damage. As the tornado approached Jacksboro from the southwest it appeared to strengthen and widen. EF2 damage was observed to a secured manufactured home on ONeal Lane and also through the Synterra Estates neighborhood, just south of Highway 380 and west of FM 4. From here, the tornado moved into the western portions of Jacksboro where many homes sustained EF2 damage from Burwick Road all the way to the High School north of Highway 380. The tornado was approximately half a mile wide as it moved through this part of the city. Considerable roof damage and tree damage was observed in this area. Some walls on homes were impacted, and some structures that were not well secured collapsed. The tornado reached EF3 strength as it approached Wichita Avenue and the Jacksboro Elementary School. One well built home on Wichita Avenue suffered very significant roof damage along with other noted damage that indicated winds over 135 mph. From there, the tornado directly struck the elementary school where it ripped the roof off the gymnasium, causing one wall to collapse, bent flag poles to the ground, overturned cars, and more. Continuing to the northeast, the tornado moved through the high school campus, also ripping part of the roof off the high school, damaging the press box at the stadium, bending the field goal posts, bending a light pole to the ground, and more. This damage was determined to be EF2 in strength. Continuing on, the tornado was tracked all the way into far southwestern Montague County by mostly tree damage, damage to metal sheds and outhouses, minor to moderate damage to roofs, and collapsed high tension wire towers. Maximum estimated winds were in the 140-150 mph range. The total length of the tornado was 34.5 miles, accounting for the 0.53 miles the tornado tracked into Montague County (see separate entry).<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It continued northeast before crossing Douglass Road, where minor tree damage occurred including uprooting and snapping many trees, before crossing into an area of chicken houses. One chicken house collapsed with minor tree damage and tin strewn in the treeline just to the northeast. It then crossed B&D Road, where a small storage outbuilding was completely destroyed, a chicken house had loss of tin roofing and increasing tree damage occurred. It then continued northeast across Prairie Point Road. A tornado debris signature was evident on radar just northeast of B&D Road and just south of Prairie Point Road. The tornado became nearly the widest at this point,|around a quarter of a mile wide. Three power poles were snapped, and tree damage intensified. In this area, the tornado increased to EF-2 intensity. Many softwood trees were snapped nearly halfway down the trunks. A residential home roof uplift occurred, with a large portion of the roof missing and the eastern wall removed. A tin metal storage building s wall panels were removed. Just northeast of this building, another open metal storage building was completely destroyed. At this area of the home and|open metal storage building, moderate EF-2 damage was observed, and the highest rating of around 130-135 mph was assigned. Some concrete pillars were moved, with one completely removed and missing. These concrete pillars were rebared into a steel plate a few feet below ground. The tornado then crossed Howard Hill Road, Buggs Ferry Road, and Hummer Loop where minor tree damage occurred. A mobile home was rolled on Fox Chase Road, numerous trees were snapped and uprooted in this area, and minor shingle damage occurred to a home. When crossing a field just southwest of Tom Bennett Road, two farming irrigation pivots were overturned in a nearby field. A storage outbuilding was destroyed and loss of tin occurred just northeast of this location. EF-2 damage occurred to a mobile home that was rolled and destroyed,|with debris strewn all over the area. Two occupants of the mobile home were thrown a considerable distance into a nearby forested area, causing some unknown injuries. A mobile home just north on Tom Bennett Road had minor roof damage, and an uprooted tree fell on top of it. The tornado began to weaken and narrow before crossing Sandyland Road, where minor tree damage occurred. The tornado lifted shortly thereafter before crossing the Alabama state line.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At this area of the home and|open metal storage building, moderate EF-2 damage was observed, and the highest rating of around 130-135 mph was assigned. Some concrete pillars were moved, with one completely removed and missing. These concrete pillars were rebared into a steel plate a few feet below ground. The tornado then crossed Howard Hill Road, Buggs Ferry Road, and Hummer Loop where minor tree damage occurred. A mobile home was rolled on Fox Chase Road, numerous trees were snapped and uprooted in this area, and minor shingle damage occurred to a home. When crossing a field just southwest of Tom Bennett Road, two farming irrigation pivots were overturned in a nearby field. A storage outbuilding was destroyed and loss of tin occurred just northeast of this location. EF-2 damage occurred to a mobile home that was rolled and destroyed,|with debris strewn all over the area. Two occupants of the mobile home were thrown a considerable distance into a nearby forested area, causing some unknown injuries. A mobile home just north on Tom Bennett Road had minor roof damage, and an uprooted tree fell on top of it. The tornado began to weaken and narrow before crossing Sandyland Road, where minor tree damage occurred. The tornado lifted shortly thereafter before crossing the Alabama state line.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system helped draw a warm, moist airmass northward across the state that helped provide the instability necessary to support severe thunderstorms later in the day. Storms initially formed along the cold front across Wisconsin during the morning hours and moved northeast across Lake Michigan, making it into the forecast area by early afternoon. The strongest line segment generated a measured wind gust of 76 mph at Frankfort Light and continued to produce damaging wind gusts across Leelanau and Antrim counties as it quickly moved northeast.||As this segment moved further away from the cold front, it began to transition into a supercell thunderstorm. This storm moved east-northeast across a very favorable environment in place across northern lower Michigan, eventually producing a tornado that caused considerable damage in the city of Gaylord. This supercell continued to trek across the area, producing baseball-sized hail in Posen.||For additional context, this was the first time in reliable recorded history (since 1950) that Gaylord was hit by a tornado. This was also the first significant tornado (EF2 or greater) in the county warning area since October 18, 2007.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado formed in Antrim county 4 miles east of Alba and continued into Otsego county 100 yards SE of the Alba Rd/Old Alba Rd intersection. The tornado continued to move east northeast for almost 16 additional miles before dissipating around 1.75 miles northeast of Sparr. The tornado was rated EF3 in Otsego county based on damage surveyed in multiple locations around the Gaylord area. The first of these locations was damage in the Nottingham Forest manufactured home community. Multiple units were completely destroyed with debris blown away from the original locations of the units (DI 4, DOD 12). The second location was the business district of Gaylord where the buildings of Hobby Lobby, Maurices, and Jimmy Johns experienced collapses of exterior walls where interior walls remained standing (DI 10, DOD 8). The last location, which had the highest estimated wind speed of 150 mph, was damage found to homes on Berkshire Ln on the northeast side of Gaylord. Most exterior walls were collapsed and only partial interior walls were left standing (DI 2, DOD 8).  The tornado dissipated at 1457 EST about 1.75 miles northeast of Sparr. Two fatalities were reported in the Nottingham Forest community, along with 44 injuries reported from various locations around Gaylord. The maximum path width in Otsego county was 200 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system helped draw a warm, moist airmass northward across the state that helped provide the instability necessary to support severe thunderstorms later in the day. Storms initially formed along the cold front across Wisconsin during the morning hours and moved northeast across Lake Michigan, making it into the forecast area by early afternoon. The strongest line segment generated a measured wind gust of 76 mph at Frankfort Light and continued to produce damaging wind gusts across Leelanau and Antrim counties as it quickly moved northeast.||As this segment moved further away from the cold front, it began to transition into a supercell thunderstorm. This storm moved east-northeast across a very favorable environment in place across northern lower Michigan, eventually producing a tornado that caused considerable damage in the city of Gaylord. This supercell continued to trek across the area, producing baseball-sized hail in Posen.||For additional context, this was the first time in reliable recorded history (since 1950) that Gaylord was hit by a tornado. This was also the first significant tornado (EF2 or greater) in the county warning area since October 18, 2007.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado formed in Antrim county 4 miles east of Alba and continued into Otsego county 100 yards SE of the Alba Rd/Old Alba Rd intersection. The tornado continued to move east northeast for almost 16 additional miles before dissipating around 1.75 miles northeast of Sparr. The tornado was rated EF3 in Otsego county based on damage surveyed in multiple locations around the Gaylord area. The first of these locations was damage in the Nottingham Forest manufactured home community. Multiple units were completely destroyed with debris blown away from the original locations of the units (DI 4, DOD 12). The second location was the business district of Gaylord where the buildings of Hobby Lobby, Maurices, and Jimmy Johns experienced collapses of exterior walls where interior walls remained standing (DI 10, DOD 8). The last location, which had the highest estimated wind speed of 150 mph, was damage found to homes on Berkshire Ln on the northeast side of Gaylord. Most exterior walls were collapsed and only partial interior walls were left standing (DI 2, DOD 8).  The tornado dissipated at 1457 EST about 1.75 miles northeast of Sparr. Two fatalities were reported in the Nottingham Forest community, along with 44 injuries reported from various locations around Gaylord. The maximum path width in Otsego county was 200 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado had estimated peak winds of 105 mph (EF-1), with a max path width of 130 yards and a path length of just over 3 miles. The tornado touched down on the 400 block of Maple Shade Rd, where it uprooted 2 large hardwood trees and 1 large softwood tree at a private residence. The tornado moved ENE and downed several large tree limbs and did minor siding damage to a building at the corner of Maple Shade Rd and Kirkwood Pike. A crop field behind the post office on the north side of Kirkwood Pike showed a clear pattern of convergence within the crops blown down by the tornado as it continued moving towards the NE. The tornado then destroyed a small shed constructed with|cinder block walls, carrying contents from inside the shed toward the NNE. Large limbs from trees to the southeast of the shed were knocked down and facing the NW, towards the centerline of the tornado track. A second small shed behind property on the 300|block of Maple Shade Rd was destroyed, with debris carried over 200 yards toward the N and NE. The tornado intensified to EF-1 strength as it moved northeast and caused near complete destruction of a large barn on a property on Farmdale Rd. Three of the 4 barn walls were removed, as well as all of the roof, with debris carried more than 200 yards toward the NE. A second large barn was partially destroyed, with one wall completely removed, two walls partially removed, and half of the roof removed. There was one minor injury of scratches due to flying debris. Two large hardwood trees were downed on the property, pointing north toward the centerline of the tornado track. The tornado continued moving northeast, putting a dent into the southeast side of one large silo before causing crop damage in a large field. The pattern of crop damage was strongly convergent, with crops on the right periphery of the tornado track laying|towards the WNW and crops on the left periphery of the tornado track laying towards the ESE. The tornado crossed over E Salem Rd near Ridge Rd, where it downed several large trees and snapped several others. Several more trees were uprooted farther north along Ridge Rd. The tornado then approached Rosedale Rd, uprooting and snapping a couple dozen trees on a private residence near Coopers Run. After crossing Rosedale Rd, the tornado then destroyed two barns and a shed. Wooden beams from one of the barns were carried by the tornado as projectiles that penetrated through the NW facing wall of another barn on the property. A house on the property was also damaged, with some siding dented, broken, or removed, and the partial collapse of a basement wall on the NW facing side of the house. The collapse of the basement wall caused minor cuts and scratches to at least two people taking shelter in the basement. The top of a farm silo was also removed. The tornado continued to produce significant damage as it hit another farm on Highland Rd. Two barns had their roofs completely removed. A third barn lost about half of its roof. A fourth structure, which appeared to be a shed without walls, collapsed. Two silos were also damaged, including the removal of the top of one of the silos. The intensity of the tornado decreased as it approached one more farm on Rynear Rd near Bells Run. The tornado partially removed the roof from one barn on the property. The tornado then moved northeast across Rynear Rd and downed a few tree limbs along Bells Run.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 325.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The environment ahead of the QLCS was favorable for severe local storms as southerly winds spread mid 60 dewpoint temperatures into a warm sector across the Southeast United States and favorable mid-level lapse rates and lifted index values helped produce mixed layer convective available potential energy (MLCAPE) as high as 1500-2000 J/kg during peak surface heating across southeast Georgia. Within the warm sector, strong shear associated with 50-70 knot low and mid-level jets beneath the left front quadrant of a 120 knot upper-level jet, 0-6 km bulk shear around 50 knots, and 0-3 km storm relative helicity in excess of 300 m2/s2 were supportive of well organized convection and potentially embedded supercell thunderstorms in a QLCS capable of producing a prolonged path of damaging winds and strong long-track tornadoes. As the QLCS swept through southeast Georgia, a few discrete supercell thunderstorms became exceptionally strong near or just ahead of the main line of thunderstorms, producing damaging winds, large hail, and a violent EF-4 tornado near Pembroke, GA that took 1 life and injured 12 others along an approximately 14.5 mile path.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service Storm Survey Team confirmed an EF-4 tornado with estimated maximum wind speed of 185 mph in Bryan County Georgia. The violent tornado began just west of the Bryan County Courthouse in Pembroke, where it damaged part of the roof, blew out some windows, and snapped numerous trees. The tornado continued along a northeast path across a wooded, marshy area, including C C Road, Stubbs Farm Road, and Stubby Road. In this area, the tornado produced significant tree damage, and heavily damaged a residence on Stubbs Farm Road. The tornado then continued east-northeast moving through Hendrix Park, Park Place subdivision, and Black Creek Golf Course, where it reached a maximum width of 3/4 of a mile and peak EF-4 intensity. Across this area, the tornado extensively damaged most homes, structures and trees. Some homes and structures were completely destroyed. Several injuries, some serious, occurred in this area as well. The tornado then continued east-northeast over wooded and marshy areas, across Olive Branch Road and across the southern end of Homestead Drive. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed in this area, causing additional injuries and tragically claiming the life of an adult female. The tornado began to weaken as it moved toward the interchange of I-16 and U.S. Highway 280. In this area, there was some minor roof damage to a large industrial building off of Oracal Parkway Circle, as well as some snapping and uprooting of trees. The tornado finally dissipated in a marshy region just east of Oracal Parkway Circle.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The environment ahead of the QLCS was favorable for severe local storms as southerly winds spread mid 60 dewpoint temperatures into a warm sector across the Southeast United States and favorable mid-level lapse rates and lifted index values helped produce mixed layer convective available potential energy (MLCAPE) as high as 1500-2000 J/kg during peak surface heating across southeast Georgia. Within the warm sector, strong shear associated with 50-70 knot low and mid-level jets beneath the left front quadrant of a 120 knot upper-level jet, 0-6 km bulk shear around 50 knots, and 0-3 km storm relative helicity in excess of 300 m2/s2 were supportive of well organized convection and potentially embedded supercell thunderstorms in a QLCS capable of producing a prolonged path of damaging winds and strong long-track tornadoes. As the QLCS swept through southeast Georgia, a few discrete supercell thunderstorms became exceptionally strong near or just ahead of the main line of thunderstorms, producing damaging winds, large hail, and a violent EF-4 tornado near Pembroke, GA that took 1 life and injured 12 others along an approximately 14.5 mile path.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service Storm Survey Team confirmed an EF-4 tornado with estimated maximum wind speed of 185 mph in Bryan County Georgia.

Extremely large hail occurred over parts of our Central Texas counties, where a record-breaking hailstone over 5.6 inches in length was documented in the Salado area of Bell County. This hailstone is now the largest recorded hailstone in our CWA to date. Two tornadoes also occurred across Central Texas in Bell County. An EF-3 tornado started in Williamson County and moved northeast and then northerly across the Salado area. Twenty-three people were injured but no fatalities occurred. Additional storms developed overnight into Wednesday as a cold front pushed through the area, some of which also became severe.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado began in northern Williamson County and additional information about the beginning of this tornado track can be found from the NWS Austin/San Antonio office.||Video evidence taken on the ground during the tornadic event, and areal footage of the damage track show the parent circulation produced at least 3 small, brief tornadoes while the storm circulation was near and east of the county line. Scattered damage points and small paths are making it difficult to determine which areas may have been impacted by each of these smaller tornadoes before the parent tornado formed. Therefore, in the area just east of the Williamson/Bell County line, the damage extent of the tornadic track has been widened to include all the known damage points (all EF-0s or EF-1s). In this case, since it is too difficult to discern the smaller tracks, and because they all formed from the same parent circulation within a short amount of time of each other, they will all be considered one tornado. The maximum width listed will remain the maximum width of the parent tornado (the EF-3 tornado).||The tornado, which began in northern Williamson County, entered extreme southern Bell County north of the junction between Bell County Road 231 and FM 2843. In this area there was a narrow swath of tree damage consistent with EF-0 intensity wind speeds, with some damage to outbuildings as well. The tornado moved east-northeast and intersected FM 2843, where the damage to trees and structures became much more significant. At least 15-20 damaged homes were visible to the survey team on both sides of FM 2843, with the most significant damage concentrated near the junction of FM 2843 and Buttermilk Road. In this vicinity, at least 10 structures suffered EF-2 to EF-3 intensity damage, with a small cluster of homes experiencing estimated peak tornado wind speeds of 150 to 165 mph. These structures had all or most of their roofs removed, and some of them had one or more exterior walls collapsed. Two churches along FM 2843 in the vicinity of Buttermilk Road were seriously damaged, with roofing material removed and multiple walls collapsed. Numerous vehicles in the area had significant damage consistent with being rolled or having flying projectiles thrown into them. Many hardwood trees along the FM 2843 corridor in the tornado path were uprooted or snapped, and many power poles were also snapped.||Beyond Buttermilk Road, the tornado continued traveling east-northeastward another 1.5 miles along FM 2843, then began a sharp turn to the northeast and eventually a northerly direction. Aerial footage allowed us to track the damage through inaccessible areas where notable tree damage, damage to homes and barns was observed along the path of the tornado.||The tornado reached Crows Ranch Rd and damaged aluminum panels of the roof of a home and blew in the panel garage door. It continued over a ridge line, then intensified again shortly before crossing FM 2484. It uprooted many large trees, shifted a large barn's walls, lifted roof panels off a shed, and caused significant damage to a residence. The residence's roof was almost entirely removed from the structure, and a section of the south facing wall was blown in. The east facing wall was completely blown out, all consistent with a high-end EF2 rating in this location. The tornado then continued northwest into the South Shore neighborhood, and then into Union Grove Park where it lifted shortly after moving onto Stillhouse Hollow Lake.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Extremely large hail occurred over parts of our Central Texas counties, where a record-breaking hailstone over 5.6 inches in length was documented in the Salado area of Bell County. This hailstone is now the largest recorded hailstone in our CWA to date. Two tornadoes also occurred across Central Texas in Bell County. An EF-3 tornado started in Williamson County and moved northeast and then northerly across the Salado area. Twenty-three people were injured but no fatalities occurred. Additional storms developed overnight into Wednesday as a cold front pushed through the area, some of which also became severe.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado began in northern Williamson County and additional information about the beginning of this tornado track can be found from the NWS Austin/San Antonio office.||Video evidence taken on the ground during the tornadic event, and areal footage of the damage track show the parent circulation produced at least 3 small, brief tornadoes while the storm circulation was near and east of the county line. Scattered damage points and small paths are making it difficult to determine which areas may have been impacted by each of these smaller tornadoes before the parent tornado formed. Therefore, in the area just east of the Williamson/Bell County line, the damage extent of the tornadic track has been widened to include all the known damage points (all EF-0s or EF-1s). In this case, since it is too difficult to discern the smaller tracks, and because they all formed from the same parent circulation within a short amount of time of each other, they will all be considered one tornado. The maximum width listed will remain the maximum width of the parent tornado (the EF-3 tornado).||The tornado, which began in northern Williamson County, entered extreme southern Bell County north of the junction between Bell County Road 231 and FM 2843. In this area there was a narrow swath of tree damage consistent with EF-0 intensity wind speeds, with some damage to outbuildings as well. The tornado moved east-northeast and intersected FM 2843, where the damage to trees and structures became much more significant. At least 15-20 damaged homes were visible to the survey team on both sides of FM 2843, with the most significant damage concentrated near the junction of FM 2843 and Buttermilk Road. In this vicinity, at least 10 structures suffered EF-2 to EF-3 intensity damage, with a small cluster of homes experiencing estimated peak tornado wind speeds of 150 to 165 mph. These structures had all or most of their roofs removed, and some of them had one or more exterior walls collapsed. Two churches along FM 2843 in the vicinity of Buttermilk Road were seriously damaged, with roofing material removed and multiple walls collapsed. Numerous vehicles in the area had significant damage consistent with being rolled or having flying projectiles thrown into them. Many hardwood trees along the FM 2843 corridor in the tornado path were uprooted or snapped, and many power poles were also snapped.||Beyond Buttermilk Road, the tornado continued traveling east-northeastward another 1.5 miles along FM 2843, then began a sharp turn to the northeast and eventually a northerly direction. Aerial footage allowed us to track the damage through inaccessible areas where notable tree damage, damage to homes and barns was observed along the path of the tornado.||The tornado reached Crows Ranch Rd and damaged aluminum panels of the roof of a home and blew in the panel garage door. It continued over a ridge line, then intensified again shortly before crossing FM 2484. It uprooted many large trees, shifted a large barn's walls, lifted roof panels off a shed, and caused significant damage to a residence. The residence's roof was almost entirely removed from the structure, and a section of the south facing wall was blown in. The east facing wall was completely blown out, all consistent with a high-end EF2 rating in this location. The tornado then continued northwest into the South Shore neighborhood, and then into Union Grove Park where it lifted shortly after moving onto Stillhouse Hollow Lake.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Very strong low level wind shear combined with marginally strong instability to result in a few strong low level circulations along the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms as it moved eastward. One such circulation produced a tornado in Adair County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado developed south of the E 820 Road and west of the S 4700 Road, where large tree limbs were snapped and homes were damaged. It moved east-northeast across the cemetery snapping softwood trees. The tornado then moved across the northwest and north sides of Stilwell, where the roofs of a number of apartment buildings were damaged, homes were damaged, outbuildings were destroyed, trees were uprooted, and power poles were blown down. Several businesses were damaged as it crossed Highway 59, a semi truck was blown over, and trees were uprooted. As the tornado moved east-northeast from Stilwell, numerous trees were uprooted, outbuildings were damaged, and some trees and power poles were snapped from the S 4720 Road to near the S 4757 Road. The tornado appeared to dissipate just east of the S 4757 road. Based on this damage, maximum estimated wind in the tornado was 95 to 105 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The environment ahead of the QLCS was favorable for severe local storms as southerly winds spread mid 60 dewpoint temperatures into a warm sector across the Southeast United States and favorable mid-level lapse rates and lifted index values helped produce mixed layer convective available potential energy (MLCAPE) as high as 1500-2000 J/kg during peak surface heating across southeast South Carolina.

The mobile home damage in this area was sufficient to justify a low-end EF-3 rating. The tornado then continued to the northeast across Burton Road and Allendale-Fairfax Highway, where it produced significant damage to a building and many trees. From here, the tornado continued a path across Confederate Highway and then across the northern end of Sycamore, ending on the northeast side of Sycamore near Williams Road at 310 PM.

The highest EF3 rating was given to a house that was constructed in the last 6 months. While this house was raised on cinder blocks, every tower of blocks had strapping to the house. The house had additional strapping directly into the foundation, as well as strapping from the cinder blocks to the foundation.

Strong southerly low level winds allowed for the rapid return of warm, moist, and unstable north behind a warm front which lifted north through East Texas and North Louisiana. Large scale forcing began to increase across Northern and Central Texas during the evening, with showers and thunderstorms becoming numerous across this area which spread into East Texas and North Louisiana during the late evening through the early morning hours of the 22nd. Given the extent of forcing within the unstable air mass in place, severe thunderstorms developed over North-central Texas and spread into East Texas, resulting in numerous reports of damaging winds, large hail, and even isolated tornadoes.

This tornado, which had weakened to an EF-1 with estimated maximum winds near 110 mph as it entered far Western Marion County, continued to track northeast across Jordan Drive and FM 729. The tornado damaged the roof of a home on Jordan Drive, with a metal building structure for storage of vehicles having two walls and its roof removed, lifting pillars and throwing them several hundred feet.  Widespread tree damage was observed with hundreds of snapped trees. Off of FM 729, a manufactured home was picked up and rolled with an occupant in it. She suffered injuries and walked nearly a half mile to FM 729 to get to help. The tornado also significantly damaged or destroyed manufactured homes along Nash Farm Road. Winds from this tornado also caused three wooden power poles to lean significantly off of Morris County Cutoff Road, before the tornado crossed over into extreme Southeast Morris County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 350.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Given the extent of forcing within the unstable air mass in place, severe thunderstorms developed over North-central Texas and spread into East Texas, resulting in numerous reports of damaging winds, large hail, and even isolated tornadoes. Redevelopment of these storms continued overnight as well over the same areas of East Texas and Northwest Louisiana, which resulted in instances of flash flooding as well, as widespread rainfall amounts of 3-6 inches fell over these areas.

Although this tornado entered Western Panola County with estimated winds around 90 mph, it strengthened to a strong EF-2 with estimated maximum winds around 130 mph, as it lifted northeast through Western Panola County. It crossed FM 348 and County Roads 881, 188, and 189, snapping and uprooting numerous trees before reaching Highway 79. In this area, several homes were significantly damaged, and one well-built residence lost most of its roof with several walls collapsed. One injury occurred in this home, although the injury was not deemed critical. The damage rating on this structure was a strong EF-2, and near this location, the tornado achieved its maximum width of approximately 500 yards. Near this location, the high level of tree damage and damage to at least one other structure also warranted a rating of EF-2. A home on County Road 293 and a metal building on County Road 237 were also damaged from this tornado, before it lifted along County Road 241 several miles southwest of Beckville.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 550.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Supercells initially developed across southwest Iowa in the vicinity of the triple point of the surface low with strong, rotating updrafts. Longevity was initially lacking with the storms, producing funnel clouds, brief tornadoes, and hail in southwest Iowa. As the cells moved northeast and matured, larger hail began to fall with golf ball sized hail falling in Adams county and baseball sized hail into Adair county. Following this period of large hail the storms produced a tornado which would remain on the ground for just over 70 miles, carving a path across central Iowa from southwest of Winterset to just northeast of Newton. The tornado peaked in Winterset, Iowa, producing EF-4 damage with wind speeds estimated near 170 mph. The tornado continued across the southern portion of the Des Moines metro area and to Newton. This is the furthest north EF-4 tornado in the CONUS this early in the year on record, the first EF-4 tornado in Iowa since October 4, 2013 which occurred in Woodbury and Cherokee Counties, and is the second longest tornado in Iowa since 1980, behind the longest occurring on June 7, 1984 at a length of 117 miles across southern Iowa. As the storm skimmed the southern Des Moines metro, cells across south central became tornadic, producing several destructive tornadoes including an EF-3 tornado in Chariton, Iowa. This heartbreaking day resulted in seven fatalities, six in Winterset and one in Chariton, making it the deadliest tornado outbreak in Iowa since 2008. At 15 tornadoes, this is also one of the earliest outbreaks of this magnitude to occur so early in the season.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado formed as two other tornadoes dissipated in southern Lucas county.  The tornado moved to the northeast across rural areas of southern into central Lucas county primarily in wooded areas and cropland with little damage.  Of note however, was a satellite tornado observed in chasing video (in seperate Storm Data entry) which developed north of the main tornado and moved south toward the main circulation, doing a complete revolution around the main tornado before being absorbed.  Shortly afterwards, the tornado crossed State Highway 14 south of Chariton destroying a conservation center which was rated EF3.  The tornado continued to the northeast removing a roof from a house along 235th Trail  and passed through an open field before entering Red Haw State Park.  The tornado ripped through a campground in the park with one fatality and one injury occurring.  The tornado exited the park and crossed Highway 34 east of Chariton with numerous outbuildings and power poles damage or destroyed.  The tornado then remained in rural wooded areas and cropland for the rest of its path with little additional damage noted.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado continued northeastward into Lycoming County where it caused extensive tree damage along and east of Laidecker Road. As the tornado moved further into Moreland Township, it knocked down hundreds of trees and damaged a silo roof, barn roof, and porch at different properties along Wallis Road. Dozens of trees were knocked down/snapped off along Moreland Township Road and Church Road and multiple outbuildings were damaged. Damage was observed to trees, barns, and outbuildings on Stahlnecker Road and along Dairy Farm Road toward Lairdsville Rd (PA-118).||Significant damage occurred at the intersection of Old Lairdsville Road and PA-118, where a barn collapsed and was thrown across the yard to the east-northeast. Notably, a piece of lumber was lodged into the hood of a Jeep on the property. Another barn suffered some minor roof damage. The tornado continued northeastward into Franklin Township, knocking down numerous trees along PA-118 into the village of Lairdsville. The most intense area of damage was on the south side of Lairdsville where multiple homes suffered heavy roof damage and broken windows, and barns were damaged. On School Lane, which parallels PA-118 to the northwest, multiple trees were knocked down and another barn was blown apart. Another piece of lumber was thrown through a truck windshield, with glass entering the eye of a passenger and the lumber narrowly missing the other passenger. East of Lairdsville, a barn was destroyed on Mill Lane. The|Lairdsville Butcher Shop experienced some structural damage as well. The tornado continued to produce tree damage along PA-118 northeast of town before lifting about a mile northeast of Lairdsville, with a total path length of nearly nine miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado continued northeastward into Lycoming County where it caused extensive tree damage along and east of Laidecker Road. As the tornado moved further into Moreland Township, it knocked down hundreds of trees and damaged a silo roof, barn roof, and porch at different properties along Wallis Road. Dozens of trees were knocked down/snapped off along Moreland Township Road and Church Road and multiple outbuildings were damaged. Damage was observed to trees, barns, and outbuildings on Stahlnecker Road and along Dairy Farm Road toward Lairdsville Rd (PA-118).||Significant damage occurred at the intersection of Old Lairdsville Road and PA-118, where a barn collapsed and was thrown across the yard to the east-northeast. Notably, a piece of lumber was lodged into the hood of a Jeep on the property. Another barn suffered some minor roof damage. The tornado continued northeastward into Franklin Township, knocking down numerous trees along PA-118 into the village of Lairdsville. The most intense area of damage was on the south side of Lairdsville where multiple homes suffered heavy roof damage and broken windows, and barns were damaged. On School Lane, which parallels PA-118 to the northwest, multiple trees were knocked down and another barn was blown apart. Another piece of lumber was thrown through a truck windshield, with glass entering the eye of a passenger and the lumber narrowly missing the other passenger. East of Lairdsville, a barn was destroyed on Mill Lane. The|Lairdsville Butcher Shop experienced some structural damage as well. The tornado continued to produce tree damage along PA-118 northeast of town before lifting about a mile northeast of Lairdsville, with a total path length of nearly nine miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Supercells initially developed across southwest Iowa in the vicinity of the triple point of the surface low with strong, rotating updrafts. Longevity was initially lacking with the storms, producing funnel clouds, brief tornadoes, and hail in southwest Iowa. As the cells moved northeast and matured, larger hail began to fall with golf ball sized hail falling in Adams county and baseball sized hail into Adair county. Following this period of large hail the storms produced a tornado which would remain on the ground for just over 70 miles, carving a path across central Iowa from southwest of Winterset to just northeast of Newton. The tornado peaked in Winterset, Iowa, producing EF-4 damage with wind speeds estimated near 170 mph. The tornado continued across the southern portion of the Des Moines metro area and to Newton. This is the furthest north EF-4 tornado in the CONUS this early in the year on record, the first EF-4 tornado in Iowa since October 4, 2013 which occurred in Woodbury and Cherokee Counties, and is the second longest tornado in Iowa since 1980, behind the longest occurring on June 7, 1984 at a length of 117 miles across southern Iowa. As the storm skimmed the southern Des Moines metro, cells across south central became tornadic, producing several destructive tornadoes including an EF-3 tornado in Chariton, Iowa. This heartbreaking day resulted in seven fatalities, six in Winterset and one in Chariton, making it the deadliest tornado outbreak in Iowa since 2008.

The tornado passed through Pammel State Park southwest of Winterset producing extensive tree damage as the tornado continued to widen into a wedge tornado.  Upon exiting the park, the tornado travelled along Carver Road.  Several residential homes were extensively damaged or destroyed along Carver Road and six deaths occurred along this stretch of road.  The tornado was at peak intensity at this time with EF4 damage occurring west of the intersection of Carver Road and Highway 169 with a house completely destoyed and removed from the foundation.  After departing the Carver Road corridor, the tornado progressed just southeast of Winterset and eventually passed east of town and crossing State Highway 92.  Damage in these areas was primarily to trees and outbuildings although a few homes were also impacted with mostly EF1 to EF2 damage.

One EF3 tornado touched down in Washington County, FL, resulting in two fatalities.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF-3 tornado tracked through Washington County into Jackson County Florida during the early morning hours of Thursday, March 31, 2022. The tornado began near Roland Rd and Ovid Ln in Washington County where it snapped tree trunks as it moved northeastward. The tornado crossed Orange Hill Rd and continued on to Gilberts Mill Rd.  On Gilberts Mill Rd near Stewart Rd, a barn was destroyed and a manufactured home was damaged and shifted on its foundation, which is in line with EF-1 damage. Snapped and uprooted trees were observed all along Gilberts Mill Rd. Further northeast, a manufactured home sustained significant damage and several outbuildings were destroyed. A camper and a greenhouse were also destroyed here, consistent with EF-1 damage. The tornado strengthened as it continued northeastward along Gilberts Mill Rd before completely destroying and sweeping away an anchored double wide manufactured home and a newer, anchored single wide home. The double wide home was the site of the two fatalities, and one person in the single wide was injured when he was thrown into the tree line grasping his mattress. Several projectiles were driven into the ground at this location. A large boat was also thrown from its trailer and overturned. Damage at this location was consistent with strong EF-2 winds.  The tornado continued to strengthen as it moved across Jewel Rd and at that location, a well-built brick home was partially destroyed and likely was sideswiped by the tornado. The end of the home that was hit sustained major collapse of roof and exterior brick walls as well as a generator ripped from its anchoring and thrown across a field. The other end of the home was less severely damaged but still suffered major roof loss. A car in the driveway was pushed off of the driveway, and an attached carport was destroyed. Across the street, a wood frame home with block foundation was completely destroyed and swept from the foundation, leaving only some cinder blocks and a floor joist. The debris from the house was thrown into a pole barn which was also destroyed. An injury occurred at this site when the home occupant ran to the barn and dove under his pickup truck. The damage to this home and the brick home are consistent with EF3 damage and maximum winds of 150 mph.  The tornado weakened some as it moved northeast, inflicting roof damage to a home and damage to out buildings along Archie Sapp Rd. On Syfrett Rd, several sheds and outbuildings were destroyed, a single wide manufactured home was flipped onto its side, and a brick home sustained major roof damage. This damage along Archie Sapp Rd and Syfrett Rd are consistent with EF1 damage. The tornado snapped a couple of tree trunks along Dilmore Rd before lifting just south of Interstate 10 near Standland Rd.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado began to intensify and develop a widespread damage swath of uprooted and snapped trees as it approached Highway 271 several miles south of Gilmer. Prior to reaching Highway 271, the tornado ripped the roof off of a single family home and tore down a wall of the home. As the tornado continued on, it reached its maximum width of 700 yards or 0.4 miles as it crossed Highway 700. The tornado intensified further as it crossed Azalea Road and Highway 154. Just before reaching this road, the tornado hit a two-story single family home, removing the home's second floor and tearing down a front exterior wall. This led to the tornado's estimated maximum wind speed of 135 mph, the strongest EF-2 rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. A nearby mobile home was also destroyed, with an occupant injured.  ||The tornado continued to track northeast and ripped off a roof of a single family home, and completely destroyed one double-wide and multiple single-wide manufactured homes. The tornado also led to structural damage to several two-story family homes with portions of the roofs removed and a projectile leading to a large hole in the side of a home. A guest house that had a frame nailed into the ground was wiped clean from its foundation with its occupant hospitalized. ||As the tornado continued to track northeast, it led to more structural damage to single family homes and complete destruction to manufactured homes between Gilmer and Ore City. On at least three occasions, manufactured homes had residents inside of them when they were picked up and thrown by the tornado. Additional widespread tree and roof damage to homes continued as the tornado approached Lake O' the Pines.

Strong southerly low level winds allowed for the rapid return of warm, moist, and unstable north behind a warm front which lifted north through East Texas and North Louisiana. Large scale forcing began to increase across Northern and Central Texas during the evening, with showers and thunderstorms becoming numerous across this area which spread into East Texas and North Louisiana during the late evening through the early morning hours of the 22nd. Given the extent of forcing within the unstable air mass in place, severe thunderstorms developed over North-central Texas and spread into East Texas, resulting in numerous reports of damaging winds, large hail, and even isolated tornadoes. Redevelopment of these storms continued overnight as well over the same areas of East Texas and Northwest Louisiana, which resulted in instances of flash flooding as well, as widespread rainfall amounts of 3-6 inches fell over these areas. These storms diminished during the early morning hours of the 22nd with the passage of a cold front through the region.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF-2 tornado touched down off of FM 2685 and Pomegranate Road where it began to sporadically uproot hardwood and softwood trees. The tornado began to intensify and develop a widespread damage swath of uprooted and snapped trees as it approached Highway 271 several miles south of Gilmer. Prior to reaching Highway 271, the tornado ripped the roof off of a single family home and tore down a wall of the home. As the tornado continued on, it reached its maximum width of 700 yards or 0.4 miles as it crossed Highway 700. The tornado intensified further as it crossed Azalea Road and Highway 154. Just before reaching this road, the tornado hit a two-story single family home, removing the home's second floor and tearing down a front exterior wall. This led to the tornado's estimated maximum wind speed of 135 mph, the strongest EF-2 rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. A nearby mobile home was also destroyed, with an occupant injured.  ||The tornado continued to track northeast and ripped off a roof of a single family home, and completely destroyed one double-wide and multiple single-wide manufactured homes. The tornado also led to structural damage to several two-story family homes with portions of the roofs removed and a projectile leading to a large hole in the side of a home. A guest house that had a frame nailed into the ground was wiped clean from its foundation with its occupant hospitalized. ||As the tornado continued to track northeast, it led to more structural damage to single family homes and complete destruction to manufactured homes between Gilmer and Ore City. On at least three occasions, manufactured homes had residents inside of them when they were picked up and thrown by the tornado. Additional widespread tree and roof damage to homes continued as the tornado approached Lake O' the Pines. Before crossing the lake into Western Marion County, the tornado ripped the roof off of the Lake O' the Pines Bait Shop before throwing multiple RV's and a motor home into the lake. Four occupants in these RV's were injured but were rescued from the lake.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.20M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Unlike the event a week prior on the 7th that featured a few separate swaths of severe weather, this one that played out mainly between 9:30 p.m. CDT on the 14th and 3:30 a.m. CDT on the 15th was highlighted by just one narrow, west-southwest to east-northeast oriented swath of multiple training supercells. In fact, some locations (Hastings and York to name a few) actually endured three to four SEPARATE severe storms over a span of 2-4 hours! With only limited exception, the vast majority of storm reports emanated from a 10-20 mile wide stripe centered roughly along a line from Elwood-Kearney-Doniphan-York. Within this zone there were numerous reports of large hail (many golf ball to tennis ball size) and damaging winds mainly in the 60-75 MPH range (but isolated pockets of 90-100+ MPH...especially east Highway 14). In addition, an EF-2 tornado was confirmed in southwest York County. Also of note was that some very unlucky locales experienced nearly a repeat performance of what just unfolded seven evenings prior...struck by another round of large hail/damaging winds only days after starting to recover from the first event on the 7th. Although this overlapping damage was somewhat evident over northeastern Adams County, it was particularly visible within the southwestern quadrant of York County, where many fields were mostly stripped bare for miles around...creating a visually striking/eerie contrast to what is typically a sea of green under the mid-June sun. ||Taking a deeper dive into storm reports and starting with the EF-2 tornado, storm surveys concluded that it tracked just over seven miles through southwestern York County shortly after midnight CDT, developing west-southwest of Lushton and lifting west of McCool Junction. Along the way, several farmsteads sustained damage (including a garage torn from a home and a wood frame outbuilding completely demolished) and two people sustained minor injuries. Interestingly, an unofficial mesonet station in or very near the tornado path actually measured a 90 MPH gust a few miles east-northeast of Lushton. Turning to the many known (and countless unknown) occurrences of large hail/damaging straight line winds within the primary convective swath, a few of the more noteworthy wind damage/speed reports included: estimated 105 MPH winds in the Waco area that toppled a 60 ft. concrete silo; estimated 95 MPH winds through parts of northeastern Clay County that crumpled a grain bin near Saronville; widespread tree and sporadic structural damage in McCool Junction; separate measured wind gusts of 75 and 65 MPH at Hastings airport (from different storms 45 minutes apart); an unofficial mesonet gust of 79 MPH near Norman. Meanwhile, a few of the most notable hail reports featured: stones up to tennis ball size in York and Trumbull; hail up to 2.25 diameter at the NWS Hastings office that significantly dented the vehicles of on-duty meteorologists working this event; various reports of ping pong ball to golf ball size hail in or near Waco, Riverdale, Lushton, Bertrand, Kearney and seven miles south of Elwood. Rainfall-wise, despite the passage of several storms over the same areas, progressive storm motions mitigated the threat of significant flooding by limiting most totals to no more than 1-2 (highest NeRAIN amount of 2.67 on the east side of York). Although the vast majority of hail/wind reports were tied to the aforementioned west-east corridor bisecting the heart of the area, two severe storms occurred well outside of this zone...one to the south/one to the north. The southern one was a discrete supercell that lumbered through parts of Webster/Nuckolls/Thayer counties but yielded only one report of quarter size hail in Nelson. Meanwhile, the northern-most severe storm was the left-split of a supercell that first developed southwest of Kearney, dropping 1.5-2 diameter hail in the Pleasanton and Loup City areas before weakening. ||Examining event evolution/meteorological background, the first weak convection of the evening within South Central Nebraska bubbled up in the Hastings area shortly before sunset, forming slightly north of a well-defined, southwest-northeast oriented quasi-stationary front stretched from west-central KS through southeast NE (storms that developed directly along this front earlier in the evening remained just southeast of the local area). Between 9-10 p.m. CDT two supercells quickly evolved out of the initial weak activity, one that pounded York with its first round of large hail and drilled the eastern part of the county with significant wind damage, and the other the aforementioned southern supercell that developed over Webster County. Between 10-11 p.m. CDT, these first severe storms either departed the local area into eastern Nebraska (the northern one) or weakened/dissipated (the southern one). However, not far to the west the primary supercell train was just getting warmed up as several severe storms rapidly blossomed along the Highway 6/Interstate 80 corridors within the western half of South Central Nebraska. This slightly-elevated activity developed in response to intensifying nocturnal convergence into a sharpening frontal zone very evident in the 850-700 millibar layer. Given that this low-mid level front was aligned nearly parallel to strong west-southwesterly upper level winds (attendant to a large scale trough centered over the Northern Rockies) and that the mesoscale environment featured a potent combination of very strong deep layer shear (50-70 knots) and decent most-unstable CAPE (1000-2000 J/kg), the stage was set for a somewhat rare episode of several supercells training along the same corridor in close succession. In fact, between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. CDT, at least 3-5 severe-warned storms marched in tandem along this path, each core spaced out roughly 25 miles from the next. During this three-hour span, places such as Hastings and York endured three separate severe storms (bringing York up to FOUR direct hits...including the initial supercell of the night). While most of these cells remained just elevated enough to preclude a tornado threat, the first storm in the supercell train managed to spawn the EF-2 in southwestern York County...apparently tapping into JUST enough lower-level moisture/instability in the vicinity of the nearby surface front to become tornadic. Finally, between 2:00-3:30 a.m. CDT, the last two training supercells of the night passed through Hamilton, Polk and northern York counties before departing the local area, bringing an end to this unique and (in places) destructive event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Amongst the widespread damage from wind and hail, it was determined an EF2 tornado occurred. The tornado formed about two miles west-southwest of Lushton and immediately damaged three farmsteads. Damage included, but was not limited to the following: a garage being torn from a home; several outbuildings destroyed; extensive tree damage; irrigation pivots overturned; grain bins destroyed. Signs of leaf and mud splatter, lofted debris, and a multi-directional/convergent damage pattern was noted. Two minor injuries occurred. ||The tornado wind field may have been as wide as 400 yards at times. The tornado climbed out of the Big Blue River Valley and moved northeast toward the northwest side of Lushton. A farmstead just northwest of town was damaged, including a completely destroyed wood frame outbuilding, uprooted trees and some structural damage to the home. The structural damage was most likely caused by a large portion of the outbuilding hitting the home. In Lushton, there was widespread tree damage. A very large grain bin was destroyed, along with a smaller one.||The rating of EF2 and maximum wind speed estimate of 115 MPH was given based on power poles snapped north-northeast of Lushton.

The tornado continued moving to the southeast crossing Woodville Pike near its intersection with Manila Road. The tornado then crossed Moler Road where it completely destroyed a barn and downed dozens of trees. Based on aerial footage, the tornado likely lifted somewhere between Moler Road and Cedarville Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Storm surge from surveys was estimated in the 8-11 ft range above MHHW along the Gulf beaches from Naples north to Barefoot Beach, and extending inland about 1 mile. Storm surge of 4-7 ft above MHHW was surveyed in the Naples Bay area and extending north to the Naples Airport area, as well as in North Naples near the Cocohatchee River. Farther south and east along the coast, storm surge values were estimated at 5-7 feet above MHHW in Marco Island and Goodland, and 4-6 ft MHHW in Everglades City and Chokoloskee.||Wind gusts as high as 110 mph were measured in the Naples area at heights well above the standard surface elevation of 33 feet. Sustained winds in the 70-75 mph range likely occurred in NW Collier County as well as far western sections of Hendry and Glades counties. Elsewhere across South Florida, peak winds were generally in the 45-70 mph range. ||A total of 13 reported tornadoes were spawned by Ian on Tuesday, September 27th and early on Wednesday, September 28th as it was approaching the SW Florida coast, the strongest being an EF-2 in the Delray Beach area of Palm Beach County. ||Storm total rainfall amounts from 8 AM on September 26th to 8 AM on September 29th ranged from 4 to 10 inches across southern Florida. The highest rainfall amounts occurred in the day or two leading up to the storm's landfall, with highest values over western metro Broward County in the 8-10 inch range, as well as in parts of the city of Miami.||All of the associated effects of Ian in southern Florida resulted in 10 fatalities, at least 2 injuries, $2.2 billion in property damage, and at least $500,000 in crop damage. The vast majority of the damage was likely caused by the significant to major storm surge in Collier County. Of the 10 deaths, 2 were directly caused by the storm surge in Collier County, and the remaining 8 were indirectly caused by the storm during evacuation, preparation, and clean-up activities.

Thunderstorms developed early in the day with steering flow tracking them slowly towards the southeast. Thunderstorms continuously developed along the Sangre de Cristo Mountains through the daytime hours, and thus, kept impacting the same areas. The Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon burn scar was hit particularly hard with rainfall estimated of at least two to four inches with locally higher amounts likely. Highway 518 near Holman and Cleveland, which had been hit hard the previous day, were hit hard again with significant flooding and debris flow observed. The southern portion of the burn scar also received significant rainfall totals, and unfortunately, this flooding took the lives of three individuals at Camp Blue Haven.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Training thunderstorms across the southern portion of the Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon burn scar in San Miguel County produced an estimated 2 to 4 inches of rainfall within the Tecolote Creek and Gallinas Creek areas which caused significant and catastropic flash flooding. Flash flooding and debris flow washed out many roadways within the area, rendering them impassable. The camp director at the Camp Blue Haven said that their playground was underwater for about 40 minutes until water receded. At 2:40 PM MDT, the chief of the Cabo Lucero Volunteer Fire Department received a call about a vehicle floating within the flood waters. When officials responded to the floating vehicle, they also discovered two people dead nearby. While initially thought to have been in their vehicle, officials later determined that the two women, 62-year-old Linda June Cummings and 84-year-old Betty Greenhaw, were swept away from a destroyed home within the Tecolote Canyon subdivision. A third individual from the same home was reported missing, and the National Guard, New Mexico State Police, and San Miguel County Sheriff's Office assised in search and rescue for several days. Finally on Tuesday, July 26th, they found the body of 62-year-old Jimmy Chris Cummings. All three were from Hale Center, Texas, but had a 100-year-lease on a cabin in Tecolote Canyon on the Camp Blue Haven property which they were visiting at the time. Eight feet of water rushing down into the canyon took down two walls of the cabin and partially destroyed the other two walls. Damages for this event are estimated.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These thunderstorms, at times, caused rainfall rates in excess of 4/hr across complex terrain that led to widespread devastating impacts. While it did not rain continuously during this 4-day stretch, the overwhelming amounts of rain and resultant flooding led to 39 deaths and widespread catastrophic damage. Entire homes and parts of some communities were swept away by flood waters, leading to costly damage to infrastructure in the region. Over 600 helicopter rescues and countless swift water rescues by boat were needed to evacuate people who were trapped by the quickly-rising flood waters. In total, 24 Flash Flood Warnings were issued between July 26th and July 30th. Between the evening of July 27th and the mid-morning hours on July 28th (the peak of the event), 13 warnings were issued, 3 of which were upgraded to a Flash Flood Emergency.||Radar-based rainfall estimates suggest that upwards of 14-16 of rain fell during this 5-day period in a narrow swath, with many more locations receiving 6-10 of rain. Most of this rain fell during the night of July 27th into the morning of July 28th, which is when the most devastating impacts were felt. The highest totals occurred across an axis that stretches from northern Clay and southern Owsley counties, east through southern Breathitt and northern Leslie counties, into Perry, Knott and Letcher counties. The highest rainfall total report was from southern Knott County, where 14.00 fell between July 25th and July 29th. This site, a cooperative (COOP) observer at Carr Creek Lake, reported 6.71 from 7am July 28th to 7am July 29th, following a report of 6.50 at that site on the previous day. Another COOP site in Buckhorn reported 8.00 of rain for the 24-hour period ending 7am on July 28th. The rainfall total in Buckhorn from July 25th to July 29th was 11.76. These rainfall values occurring in such a short period of time are incredibly rare: there is less than a 1 in 1000 chance for this much rainfall over five days in a given year.||The incredible rainfall also led to significant rises and flooding on many rivers in eastern Kentucky including on the main stem of the Kentucky River; North, Middle and South forks of the Kentucky River; Red River and Licking River. At Whitesburg, the North Fork of the Kentucky River swelled well above major flood stage, reaching close to 21' before gauge failure (the previous flood of record was 14.7' in 1957). The North Fork of the Kentucky River at Jackson also reached major flood, setting a new record crest of 43.47' (the previous record was 43.1' set in 1939). The river flooding caused a second round of destruction for communities in the region, and caused flooding in downstream areas that did not receive as much rainfall.||*Note* Given the widespread nature and severity of this event - any dollar amount estimated by storm data will not do the event as a whole justice. Since eastern KY was a national declaration, FEMA will be doing a full cost assessment. Will use this data once available for total monetary amounts of damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Multiple reports of flash flooding were received across southern Breathitt County during the overnight hours of the 27th into the 28th.

These thunderstorms, at times, caused rainfall rates in excess of 4/hr across complex terrain that led to widespread devastating impacts. While it did not rain continuously during this 4-day stretch, the overwhelming amounts of rain and resultant flooding led to 39 deaths and widespread catastrophic damage. Entire homes and parts of some communities were swept away by flood waters, leading to costly damage to infrastructure in the region. Over 600 helicopter rescues and countless swift water rescues by boat were needed to evacuate people who were trapped by the quickly-rising flood waters. In total, 24 Flash Flood Warnings were issued between July 26th and July 30th. Between the evening of July 27th and the mid-morning hours on July 28th (the peak of the event), 13 warnings were issued, 3 of which were upgraded to a Flash Flood Emergency.||Radar-based rainfall estimates suggest that upwards of 14-16 of rain fell during this 5-day period in a narrow swath, with many more locations receiving 6-10 of rain. Most of this rain fell during the night of July 27th into the morning of July 28th, which is when the most devastating impacts were felt. The highest totals occurred across an axis that stretches from northern Clay and southern Owsley counties, east through southern Breathitt and northern Leslie counties, into Perry, Knott and Letcher counties. The highest rainfall total report was from southern Knott County, where 14.00 fell between July 25th and July 29th. This site, a cooperative (COOP) observer at Carr Creek Lake, reported 6.71 from 7am July 28th to 7am July 29th, following a report of 6.50 at that site on the previous day. Another COOP site in Buckhorn reported 8.00 of rain for the 24-hour period ending 7am on July 28th. The rainfall total in Buckhorn from July 25th to July 29th was 11.76. These rainfall values occurring in such a short period of time are incredibly rare: there is less than a 1 in 1000 chance for this much rainfall over five days in a given year.||The incredible rainfall also led to significant rises and flooding on many rivers in eastern Kentucky including on the main stem of the Kentucky River; North, Middle and South forks of the Kentucky River; Red River and Licking River. At Whitesburg, the North Fork of the Kentucky River swelled well above major flood stage, reaching close to 21' before gauge failure (the previous flood of record was 14.7' in 1957). The North Fork of the Kentucky River at Jackson also reached major flood, setting a new record crest of 43.47' (the previous record was 43.1' set in 1939). The river flooding caused a second round of destruction for communities in the region, and caused flooding in downstream areas that did not receive as much rainfall.||*Note* Given the widespread nature and severity of this event - any dollar amount estimated by storm data will not do the event as a whole justice.

These thunderstorms, at times, caused rainfall rates in excess of 4/hr across complex terrain that led to widespread devastating impacts. While it did not rain continuously during this 4-day stretch, the overwhelming amounts of rain and resultant flooding led to 39 deaths and widespread catastrophic damage. Entire homes and parts of some communities were swept away by flood waters, leading to costly damage to infrastructure in the region. Over 600 helicopter rescues and countless swift water rescues by boat were needed to evacuate people who were trapped by the quickly-rising flood waters. In total, 24 Flash Flood Warnings were issued between July 26th and July 30th. Between the evening of July 27th and the mid-morning hours on July 28th (the peak of the event), 13 warnings were issued, 3 of which were upgraded to a Flash Flood Emergency.||Radar-based rainfall estimates suggest that upwards of 14-16 of rain fell during this 5-day period in a narrow swath, with many more locations receiving 6-10 of rain. Most of this rain fell during the night of July 27th into the morning of July 28th, which is when the most devastating impacts were felt. The highest totals occurred across an axis that stretches from northern Clay and southern Owsley counties, east through southern Breathitt and northern Leslie counties, into Perry, Knott and Letcher counties. The highest rainfall total report was from southern Knott County, where 14.00 fell between July 25th and July 29th. This site, a cooperative (COOP) observer at Carr Creek Lake, reported 6.71 from 7am July 28th to 7am July 29th, following a report of 6.50 at that site on the previous day. Another COOP site in Buckhorn reported 8.00 of rain for the 24-hour period ending 7am on July 28th. The rainfall total in Buckhorn from July 25th to July 29th was 11.76. These rainfall values occurring in such a short period of time are incredibly rare: there is less than a 1 in 1000 chance for this much rainfall over five days in a given year.||The incredible rainfall also led to significant rises and flooding on many rivers in eastern Kentucky including on the main stem of the Kentucky River; North, Middle and South forks of the Kentucky River; Red River and Licking River. At Whitesburg, the North Fork of the Kentucky River swelled well above major flood stage, reaching close to 21' before gauge failure (the previous flood of record was 14.7' in 1957). The North Fork of the Kentucky River at Jackson also reached major flood, setting a new record crest of 43.47' (the previous record was 43.1' set in 1939). The river flooding caused a second round of destruction for communities in the region, and caused flooding in downstream areas that did not receive as much rainfall.||*Note* Given the widespread nature and severity of this event - any dollar amount estimated by storm data will not do the event as a whole justice. Since eastern KY was a national declaration, FEMA will be doing a full cost assessment. Will use this data once available for total monetary amounts of damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Multiple reports of flash flooding were received across the eastern half of Letcher County.

Several broken lines of convection drifted from west to east across the region, spurred on by 1000-1500 J/kg MLCAPE and Precipitable Water values approaching 2 inches. A weak mid-level low across the mid-Mississippi Valley also contributed to broad uplift across the region, with precipitation being widespread across most of the lower Midwest and Ohio Valley during the afternoon of September 3rd. Where heavy thunderstorms lingered the longest, flash flooding was reported, with rainfall reports exceeding 10 inches in isolated areas.

The anomalously moist airmass, with PWATs near 2.2 inches, remained over the region. Dense clouds were advected across much of the area Tuesday morning in the westerly flow. Cloudiness limited heating across southeast Georgia whereas northeast Florida experienced breaks in the cloud deck allowing for delayed diurnal destabilization. Storms were diurnally initiated across north central Florida in the afternoon due to less cloud cover over that area. Late start for the sea breezes, with them pushing inland late afternoon into evening.  Weak westerly flow allowed the Atlantic sea breeze to move inland to the St. Johns River basin. Diurnally driven storms in north central Florida lifted north and interacted with the sea breeze boundary in the evening. Slow-moving storms produced heavy rainfall and caused street flooding in Marion, Alachua and Clay counties. These storms produced about 2.5 to 4 inches of rain. A stronger storm in Marion county damaged a metal roof. Another stronger storm produced penny sized hail in Duval.

Eastern KY's placement in the warm sector, combined with ample moisture advection from the Gulf of Mexico, set the stage for shower and thunderstorm development. Storms developed to our west, over western and central Kentucky, and began to impact eastern Kentucky by just after noon. Strong winds aloft resulted in wind damage at the surface, as well as decent storm motions. Most of the storms had exited the state just 2 to 3 hours later. Some of the strongest storms brought widespread downed trees and power lines and caused damage to buildings and home around eastern Kentucky.

Strong southerly flow out ahead of the low pressure system brought in highly anomalous moisture content across the southern half of Arizona, with PWATs surging to 1.1-1.4, which are near record values for mid-October.  Along with the highly anomalous moisture values, moderate to high instability values were also present with MLCAPE rising to 1000-1500 J/KG. Bulk shear values between 25-35 kts were also present. The combination of the highly anomalous moisture content, instability, and shear along with the strong dynamic forcing to the east and north of the low pressure system was a recipe for these showers and thunderstorms to produce flash flooding as well as severe wind gusts and hail. The greatest flash flood impact occurred along portions of western Maricopa County in the area from Buckeye to Tonopah, The greatest damaging wind impact occurred in the Tonopah area, where two rounds of severe thunderstorms, one hour apart, impacted causing widespread power outages due to downed power poles, destroyed two mobile homes, damaged dairy farm structures, and resulted livestock losses. Severe hail was also reported with a storm that moved into the Mesa to Scottsdale area during the overnight period. ||As the area of low pressure moved eastward on the 16th, lingering moisture resulted in the development of more showers and thunderstorms, mainly concentrated across the higher terrain areas east of Phoenix. One isolated storm in particular developed on a open field near Sun Lakes, resulting in the development of a short-lived landspout during the mid-afternoon hours with no damages reported.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 12 year old girl, who lives in the Sun City West Retirement Community, was struck by lightning while playing outside, causing her heart to stop. Her father was able to successfully resuscitate her. The girl was taken to the hospital afterwards.

This weather system was not only a prolific wind producer, which led to many reports of high wind and wind damage, but also dust storm conditions and several large fires to occur.  The largest fire occurred in northeast Decatur County, burning north into Nebraska.  This fire was not extinguished until the 29th. During the afternoon and early evening hours of the 22nd, storms began to form along a dryline across northwestern Kansas and southwestern Nebraska. These storms primarily produced large hail up to baseball size, with a few instances of damaging thunderstorm winds. Later in the evening, a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) developed over eastern Colorado, spreading east across northwest Kansas and southwest Nebraska during the overnight hours. These storms produced several tornadoes, along with thunderstorm wind gusts and thunderstorm wind damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Multiple reports of hail associated with second storm that moved through Leoti.
