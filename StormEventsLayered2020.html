This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tree was blown down onto and destroyed a mobile home near Moorhead. An individual was trapped in the home before being airlifted for an injury.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The worst damage occurred across White and Cumberland Counties, where winds estimated up to 95 mph caused millions of dollars in damage and injured 1 person.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The massive, severe macroburst that struck White County moved into Cumberland County near Pleasant Hill and continued northeast for another 27 miles to the Morgan County border. Within the 5 miles wide macroburst, severe wind damage struck Pleasant Hill, Baker Crossroads, Crossville, and Fairfield Glade. Hundreds of trees were blown down with some falling into and through homes, including on Glade Creek Road and Deck Road in Pleasant Hill. Several homes suffered roof, gutter and siding damage on Carter Town Road, Norman Drive, Eureka Drive, Creston Road, and Bristow Road in the Baker Crossroads area, as well as the Charleston Plantation apartments in Crossville. A warehouse building collapsed at the corner of Highway 70 and Northside Drive, and part of the roof was blown off the Cumberland Farmers Co-op Building in Crossville. A tractor trailer was blown over on Taylors Chapel Road, and a metal garage was destroyed at North Cumberland Elementary School. Old Jamestown Highway and I-40 at mile marker 319 were both blocked by downed trees, and numerous other roads were blocked by fallen trees, power lines, power poles, and other debris. 1 person was injured at the Deer Run RV Park in Fairfield Glade when a tree fell through an RV. Peak wind gusts of 63 mph were measured at both the Crossville Memorial Airport ASOS and the City of Crossville downtown Davis weather station, which were located on the south edge of the macroburst. Winds in the core of the macroburst were estimated up to 95 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Strong southerly winds drew unseasonably warm, moist air northward into the region ahead of a cold front. Early morning temperatures were in the upper 60s and lower 70s with dewpoints in the upper 60s. This aided in the development of uncapped surface-based instability that was more than sufficient to maintain the QLCS. A strengthening  shortwave trough was lifting northeastward across the Ozarks during the event resulting in strengthing wind fields and ample wind shear.  The QLCS evolved into a Line Echo Wave Pattern (LEWP) with several persistent mesovortices across north Mississippi and a few transient mesovortices farther north into west Tennessee. Widespread damaging wind was observed across the entire County Warning Area (CWA) along with 13 tornadoes. In addition to the severe weather potential, heavy rainfall was a noted threat. Isolated flash flooding did occur with this system.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Thunderstorm winds moved across Tunica, MS and areas south and east of the community.

It was determined by a National Weather Service survey team that damage to the RV park was the result of rear-flank downdraft winds which was a straight-line wind event. The survey team estimated the wind speeds to be 100-130 miles per hour based on damage to the RV park. This was based on damage to trailers, outbuildings, vehicles, and other structures.

In Flora, the steeple was blown off the Jones Chapel Missionary Baptist Church, and a woman was injured and hospitalized when a tree fell onto her home and caused eight of her ribs to be broken while in her bed. Additional minor structural damage occurred in Flora. Dozens of homes across the county received damage from wind and from trees falling onto them, and several roads were closed due to fallen trees. Roofing and structural damage occurred to buildings and homes around the Gluckstadt area, including some busted windows and air conditioning units due to wind driven large hail. The service area of the Quick Lube and Tire shop in Gluckstadt experienced significant structural damage. A wall also collapsed at a commercial building along Nissan Parkway.

This storm was somewhat isolated in the damage it caused, but the worsts of this two day event occurred the next day. The morning of May 4 started out incredibly active across eastern Kansas and western Missouri. In eastern Kansas several supercells formed and moved eastward into western Missouri. The initial round of supercells were generally decaying as they progressed eastward, but one particular supercell formed an enhanced downburst in western Bates County and produced between 70 and 90 mph winds. Upstream of this supercell in eastern Kansas 15-20 power poles were snapped near the intersection known as Jingo, KS. This storm then went on to produce heavy damage to trees and structures between Amsterdam and Butler. It was in this area just west of Passaic that a single fatality occurred when a tree fell into a house.

Meanwhile, a strong upper level low opened up into a trough as it entered the Southern Plains during the evening of the 11th, with large scale forcing ahead of the trough enhancing shower and thunderstorm development across much of West-central, Central, East and Southeast Texas during the evening through the early morning hours. Given the extent of shear, instability, and upper level forcing in place across the warm sector, numerous showers and thunderstorms developed over these areas, which quickly spread east northeast into East Texas around and shortly after daybreak on the 12th. Some of these storms were severe, producing numerous reports of damaging winds, large hail, and locally heavy rainfall which resulted in isolated flash flooding. Two isolated tornadoes also touched down in Shelby and Southern Harrison Counties. ||While there was a lull in the thunderstorms from late morning through much of the afternoon, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed across portions of Northeast Texas well behind the dry line which had mixed east to near Texarkana into Western Louisiana, and near the center of the upper level trough. Steep lapse rates aloft and the drier low level air mass contributed to areas of damaging winds and isolated instances of large hail, with the majority of the wind damage from a collapsing thunderstorm which originated just east of Dallas, and quickly moved east along the I-20 corridor in East Texas. Aided by strong pressure rises behind an associated cold front, a large swath of damaging winds were noted with the severe gust front, with gusts ranging from 50-70 mph well ahead of the collapsed storm. This resulted in numerous reports of downed trees and power lines across East Texas and Western Louisiana, with AEP Swepco noting that over 64,000 customers were without power at one time in the aftermath of the storms. These damaging winds exited East Texas into Western Louisiana by early evening before gradually weakening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A large tree snapped and fell on a 60 year old male standing in his driveway, fatally injuring him.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It was a very warm afternoon, with high temperatures in the 80s to lower 90s. It was 92 degrees at Harrison (Boone County) and Russellville (Pope County), and 91 degrees at Mena (Polk County), and Mountain Home (Baxter County). Normal highs are in the upper 60s to mid 70s.||The heat and increasing moisture made the atmosphere extremely unstable. However, thunderstorms had some difficulty developing. Data acquired from a balloon launch by the National Weather Service at the North Little Rock Airport (Pulaski County) revealed warming aloft (an inversion) at 100 pm CDT. Readings went from 68 degrees at 2000 feet to 75 degrees at 2500 feet. This tended to cap the lower levels of the atmosphere, and prevented storms from taking off. For most of the afternoon, there were few clouds.||Capping was weakest in the northeast, and this is where isolated storms finally went haywire by 500 pm CDT. One storm in particular peaked the interest of radar operators and kept them busy for several hours. The storm unleashed baseball size hail at Strawberry (Lawrence County), and golf balls at Horseshoe Bend (Izard County), Lynn (Lawrence County), and Ravenden (Lawrence County).||The biggest event of month happened on the 12th (Easter) and 13th. There were more than 1,000 reports of wind damage and at least 130 tornadoes from Texas to the Carolinas. Sadly, there were three dozen casualties.||We had to deal with a line of nasty thunderstorms. The line had bowing segments, indicating that powerful winds were driving the storms forward and causing them to bulge outward. Severe Thunderstorm Warnings were first issued between 530 pm and 600 pm CDT, and continued for five hours until the storms moved east of the Mississippi River. The storms produced damaging wind gusts from 60 to more than 80 mph, and knocked out power to at least 150,000 utility customers.||There were numerous reports of trees and power lines downed, with trees blocking roads in some cases. Trees fell on residences, resulting in a death at White Hall (Jefferson County) and an injury at Glen Rose (Hot Spring County). Outbuildings and sheds were damaged or destroyed. A roof was blown off of a poultry farm on Highway 154 north of Danville (Yell County). A 68 mph gust was measured at Petit Jean State Park (Conway County).||Much of Arkansas received one to more than three inches of rain, with the heaviest amounts over central and southern sections of the state. Monticello (Drew County) had an estimated 3.73 inches of precipitation on the 12th, breaking a daily record that stood since 1877.||This was one of the more significant downpours of the month, and contributed to largely above average rainfall totals. Surpluses of liquid in April were more than an inch at Little Rock (Pulaski County), and Pine Bluff (Jefferson County).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous trees and power lines were down in the area.

The most concentrated area of damage was located at 595 Charlie Norris Rd, where several large barns, a greenhouse, and the top of a silo all experienced major structural damage. All of the barn and silo damage was moved from the SW to the NNE at a distance of up to half a mile. The medium sized greenhouse had its entire roof structure destroyed. A single-wide mobile home was turned and rolled once or twice, with three people inside. The three people all sustained bruises and cuts, with the most significant being a female who was thrown into a fish tank and had to go the hospital. An old farmhouse adjacent to the mobile home sustained major roof damage as well. All across the property, there were uprooted and snapped trees. Across the street, on the west side of the road, a medium sized barn was completely destroyed.At 645 Charlie Norris Rd, there was extensive tree damage, especially cedar trees, along with outbuildings and barns. The home owner had recently built a new fence with posts in concrete, and some of these posts were leaning or lifted out of the ground. The owner was putting away a small John Deere tractor about a minute before the storm struck and the winds were so strong, it lifted the tractor almost a foot off the ground and rotated it approximately 60 degrees. A smaller house on the property experienced damage on the front porch, which had its foundation lifted, damaging the roof and gutter. The emergency manager in Clark County KY reported sporadic wind damage across the county, mainly in the form of tree damage. One of the most concentrated areas of damage was 470 Ford Hampton Rd in Winchester.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These storms produced widespread straight-line wind damage across every county of Middle Tennessee, with numerous trees, power lines, and buildings damaged. Some of the worst damage occurred across the Nashville metro area, where winds between 60-80 mph knocked out power to over 130,000 customers - the worst power outage on record for the city. Some customers were without power for up to one week. A peak wind gust of 71 mph was measured at the Nashville International Airport, which is the 5th highest on record at that location. Other counties across Middle Tennessee also saw severe wind damage and tens of thousands of customers lose power. Sadly, 1 man was killed and 5 other people injured by falling trees due to the storms. This event was determined to be a derecho due to the widespread and long-track of the straight-line wind damage, and was likely the worst straight-line wind event across Middle Tennessee since the July 13, 2004 derecho. Total damage across Middle Tennessee, including Lincoln, Moore, and Franklin Counties, was estimated by the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency at $16,671,521.

The heavy rains resulted from a deep plume of tropical moisture lifted northward ahead of the cold front. Heavy rain began during the evening of April 12th and exited the region shortly after sunrise on the 13th, lasting roughly a 12-hour period. Between 1.5 and 4 inches of rain fell across the mountains and foothills, with pockets of 4 to 7.5 inches observed near the crest of the Blue Ridge. ||Given the heavy rainfall rates, the result was mainly flash flooding of small creeks and streams.  Hardest hit were portions of Watauga County, NC, where 4 to 7.5 inches fell county-wide.  Extensive flooding was observed along the East Fork of the South Fork of the New River, near the Hidden Hills neighborhood.  Multiple homes were evacuated due flooding, with many long-time residents reporting that this event was the highest that river had risen in at least 20 years. Flooding elsewhere across Watauga County was not as severe, with some roads flooded. National Water Model simulations of this basin indicate that the flooding may have risen to a 25 to 50-year recurrence interval.    ||Flooding extended into Ashe County, NC where multiple roads sustained severe damage, being either partially or totally collapsed/washed out where they intersected smaller creeks. Many other counties across the mountains and foothills reported mainly flooded roads with little to no other damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Thunderstorm winds blew a tree onto a wooden outbuilding on J.

Approximately ten minutes later, a homestead was heavily damaged about seven miles south-southwest of Memphis. At 1810 CST, a metal building, several more homesteads, and trees were damaged along Texas State Highway 86 west of Estelline. Microburst winds were estimated between 80 and 100 mph based on the damage indicators gathered during a NWS storm survey.||A second severe storm formed south-southwest of Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport around 1930 CST. This storm then tracked to the east-southeast developing severe wind gusts within the city of Lubbock.

The strongest winds were experienced in central and east-central Iowa where 100+ mph winds were observed. Some of the strongest winds were in an area from roughly Marshalltown, IA eastward along the Highway 30 corridor to the Mississippi River, where estimated winds exceeded 120+ mph and approached 140 mph. A number of QLCS tornadoes were also experienced within the Highway 30 corridor. One of the most remarkable aspects of the derecho was the duration of severe winds, with many areas experiencing at least periodic, if not persistent, severe level (58+ mph) winds over a roughly 30 minute time frame. As the derecho moved eastward out of Iowa, it continued to expand, but weakened from its peak strength. Winds continued to exceed severe criteria (58+ mph) in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan and began to produce additional QLCS tornadoes across northern Illinois before fading out across northern Indiana and southern Michigan.||In the wake of the derecho, damage was substantial in many areas, rural and urban. Many agriculture fields, mainly corn, were flattened within the swaths of strongest winds. Initial estimates suggest at least 850,000 acres of partial or complete crop loss occurred from this event. Within urban and wooded areas extensive tree and structure damage was seen, including complete roof failure in a few instances. At its peak, total estimated customers without power exceeded 1.4 million across the affected states. In total, early estimates on losses (agriculture, infrastructure, private property) have exceeded $7.5 billion across the states affected. ||Environment: Broadly speaking, it was a ripe day for thunderstorms across the affected area with MUCAPE values often exceeding 3500-4000 J/kg by the mid morning hours concurrent with mid-upper level short wave support, and indications that any cold pool development would be strong (difference between cold pool and ambient air) and potentially long lived. For detailed environmental analysis, including soundings, please view the various local NWS office event review pages: NWS Des Moines, NWS Quad Cities, NWS Chicago, NWS Milwaukee, NWS Central Illinois, NWS Northern Indiana, or NWS Indianapolis.||Additional Details: Numerous injuries occurred during the derecho and in the aftermath during cleanup, including 4 direct and indirect deaths of which 3 occurred in Iowa (two in Poweshiek County and one in Linn County) and 1 in Indiana (Fort Wayne).||Disclaimer: The August 10, 2020 derecho resulted in widespread high-end damage across large portions of central and southern Iowa. Given the size and scope of the event and understanding that final damage and loss estimates (agriculture, infrastructure, and private property) will take months to complete, the NWS is not able to estimate the monetary impact at this time. Values may be added as more data becomes from various sources in future months.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Law enforcement reported a large tree fell on a home.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Trees, tree limbs and power lines were blown down in Lake Villa.

The cost of damage from this storm was extreme, reaching an estimated 7.5 billion dollars along the path of these storms from Iowa through Illinois.  Two brief tornadoes have been confirmed within the widespread swath of wind damage, one just north of the Eastern Iowa Airport in Linn County Iowa, and one just south of Freeport, Illinois. These tornadoes have been designated as EF-U, as there was no observable damage directly attributable to the tornadoes from which an EF-scale rating could be assigned. While an average of two derechos a year occur across the area, a derecho of this intensity is a roughly once-in-a-decade occurrence. Another unusual aspect of this derecho was the duration of the strong winds, with gusts over 60 mph for over an hour at some locations.||The most extreme winds, estimated at 110-140 mph, destroyed or damaged numerous outbuildings, barns, grain bins, homes, mobile homes, apartment buildings, trees, and power poles in parts of Benton, Linn, Jones, Cedar, and Clinton Counties. The Cedar Rapids area was particularly hard hit. One fatality occurred in Linn County, as a tree fell on a cyclist. Several homes, apartment complexes, and businesses sustained damage consistent with 130-140 mph winds. Radio transmission towers in Marion and Clinton, Iowa collapsed due to winds estimated around 130 mph. Wind gusts of 80-100 mph were common as the line of storms moved through the Quad Cities area and then through northwest Illinois. A small pocket of winds estimated at 100-110 mph impacted Princeton, IL in Bureau County, where a 150 foot communications tower collapsed and numerous power poles were snapped. In addition to the damage, numerous long-duration power outages occurred across the region. Damage to crops was considerable along the derecho path. Numerous semi trucks were also blown off roadways along the path of the derecho.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Widespread straight-line winds that produced extensive damage were reported throughout Linn County, associated with a derecho. These winds lasted around an hour in total at any one location, even though the initial line of storms moved out quickly. Damaging straight-line winds continued and were associated with the rear inflow jet. Maximum wind speeds were estimated to be 80 to 100 MPH for much of the county, with areas in central Linn County that had wind speed estimates that were 120 MPH or higher. The highest estimated wind speed were in the Cedar Rapids area where extensive damage to an apartment complex occurred with damage indicating winds about 140 MPH. A radio transmission tower also collapsed with wind speed estimated at 130 MPH. These estimates were determined based off damage reports and photos submitted through social media as well as a damage survey. The peak thunderstorm wind gust measured at the Cedar Rapids airport ASOS before it lost power was 68 MPH. The duration of strong winds caused extensive damaged most if not all trees, crops, and structures in their path. Due to the widespread damage, long duration power outages occurred. One fatality occurred here when a 63 year old man riding a bicycle was struck and killed by a tree that was knocked down due to the winds. There were also numerous injuries reported in the Cedar Rapids area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

There were 10 injuries reported in north central and northeast Illinois within the NWS Chicago/Romeoville County Warning Area (CWA).  Local officials estimated that nearly one million customers lost power across northern Illinois at the height of the derecho and some people were without power for several days.  Damage was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in north central and northeast Illinois, with several billions of dollars in damages across the entire Corn Belt region including significant damage to crops and agriculture infrastructure.  While much of the damage was due to straight line winds, there were also 14 tornadoes documented in north central and northeast Illinois.||The combination of high moisture, explosive instability and very strong atmospheric wind flow for mid-summer had developed quickly over the Corn Belt region on the morning of August 10th.  This resulted in a progressive, well-organized complex of storms for hundreds of miles and at times traveling nearly 70 mph.  After bringing extensive damage from extreme wind speeds in Iowa that morning, the damage transitioned across northern Illinois from widespread wind damage to narrow, brief and intense swaths associated with compact circulations within the thunderstorm line, some of which were associated with tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Trees were blown down in Matthiessen State Park.

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Several trees and power lines were blown down.

Most of the wind damage occurred with the passage of a rare derecho; a large fast-moving complex of thunderstorms with powerful straight-line winds.  In addition, strong wind gusts from 59 to 71 mph not associated with the derecho, occurred prior to and following the passage of this system over the urban corridor and plains of northeast Colorado.||By midday the derecho, which originated over the Great Basin, moved over the northern and central mountains, and then rapidly northeast across the I-25 corridor by mid afternoon.  These storms then tracked across the plains from late afternoon into the early evening hours.  Wind gusts from 60 to 80 mph were common with a few gusts exceeding 90 mph.  The highest gust observed was 110 mph, at the Winter Park Ski area, around 12000 feet.  Xcel Energy said in a press release that more than 208,000 customers lost power because of the storm statewide.

The environment ahead of the QLCS was unusually unstable for this time of day and year, with gulf moisture spreading upper 60 F to near 70 F dewpoints into a warm sector across the Southeast United States and mid level lapse rates around 7 C/km helping produce mixed layer convective available potential energy (MLCAPE) as high as 2000 J/kg across Southeast South Carolina. Within the warm sector, very strong vertical shear associated with a 50 knot plus low and mid-level jet, effective bulk shear around 70 knots, effective storm relative helicity in the 400-600 m2/s2 range, and VAD wind profiles displaying large, curved low-level hodographs were supportive of well organized convection and potentially embedded supercell thunderstorms in a QLCS capable of producing a prolonged path of damaging winds and strong long-track tornadoes. As the QLCS swept through Southeast South Carolina, a few supercell thunderstorms became exceptionally strong while partially breaking away from the main line of thunderstorms, producing widespread wind damage and strong long-track tornadoes. ||A total of 13 confirmed tornadoes occurred across Southeast South Carolina, including a long track EF-4 tornado in Hampton County that took the lives of 5 people and injured 60 others along an approximately 24 mile path. The EF-4 tornado was the first to have occurred across Southeast South Carolina and the last to have occurred in the entire state of South Carolina since November 17, 1995, almost 25 years prior. This particular tornado was associated with a storm that produced a destructive path of straight-line wind damage and series of long track and intermittent tornadoes for over 150 miles, beginning in Screven County, Georgia, then continuing northeast across Hampton County, Colleton County, Dorchester County, and Berkeley County, South Carolina before leaving the area and eventually shifting offshore along the South Carolina coast. Two other storms were responsible for the remaining tornadoes across the area, most of which occurred from a single storm occurring across Edisto Island, Seabrook Island and Kiawah Island. Outside the EF-4 tornado in Hampton County, straight-line winds near a passing tornado claimed the life of one individual and injured one in Colleton County, while another tornado caused 6 injuries across Berkeley County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Colleton County Fire Rescue Emergency Management Division reported a tree down on a residence in the 700 block of Barracada Road due to strong inflow winds near a passing tornado.

A line of thunderstorms originated across New York state and moved eastward into New England during the afternoon hours, producing widespread damage. New York State Mesonet weather stations recorded widespread wind gusts between 50 and 60mph down the Mohawk Valley into the Greater Capital District with a 67mph wind gust measurement at the Albany International Airport. This ranks as the highest gust for the month of October with records dating back to 1987.  Microbursts were confirmed by storm surveys in Root, Pittstown, and Johnsonville, NY, with estimated wind speeds of 80, 90, and 100 mph, respectively.  In addition, a brief EF0 tornado occurred in Canajoharie, NY.  There was also one fatality when a tree fell onto a man's car while driving on the Taconic Parkway. ||This event was classified as a serial derecho based on the 320 mile long damage swath and distribution of significant wind gusts (75 mph and above). The fact that trees across the region were fully leafed exacerbated the resulting wind damage and produced widespread power outages. As a result of this storm, there were over 160,000 power outages across the region. Schools closed the next day due to lack of power, and dry ice was distributed to the public while power was being restored over the next few days.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A pine tree fell onto a car and resulted in a fatality.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Deepening surface low pressure tracked across Michigan and into Ontario during the day, whipping a cold front across the region during the late morning and early afternoon. Some of the classic ingredients for a widespread wind event were present, including a negatively- tilted trough, jet positioning over the region, and a favorable Great Lakes surface low track. Strong post-frontal 3 hour pressure rises of 5-7 mb were observed, and a low-topped mostly lightning-free convective line accompanied the boundary. Widespread wind gusts of at least 45-55 MPH were observed, with several higher measured gusts seen.  Along the convective line, gusts of 55-65 MPH likely occurred. This resulted in widespread reports of wind damage to trees and power lines, with a few instances of mostly minor structural damage. Unfortunately, two deaths occurred on Clendening Lake when two persons were boating at the time the convective line arrived.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> More info: https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2020/11/17/bodies-missing-michigan-hunters-found-clendening-lake-ohio/6322047002/||Two men, aged 43 and 60 and residents of south central Michigan, died when an overloaded watercraft, convective wind, and not being prepared for the environmental conditions all played a role in capsizing their boat. Most likely, based on available information, they were very low in the water and became swamped by high wave action. This resulted in them going into the water, and with no personal flotation devices, they succumbed to hyperthermia and drowned.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Then a derecho, which developed just southeast of Lake Erie during the early morning hours, moved rapidly southeast across Pennsylvania before exiting off the New Jersey coast by early afternoon (130 PM). Damaging winds associated with this derecho were sporadic over western and central Pennsylvania, but as the thunderstorm complex moved into increasingly unstable air in the eastern part of the state just before noon, wind damage reports became more numerous and widespread.  Most of these reports were confined within a 50-mile wide swath extending from Berks County eastward to the Philadelphia metro area, then further east to the Ocean County shoreline in New Jersey.  Wind gust reports between 60 and 70 MPH were common within this swath, with some of the highest gusts as follows:  83 MPH at Reading Regional Airport (Berks County), 76 MPH in Pottstown (Montgomery County), 75 MPH in Malvern (Chester County), and 71 MPH in the Holmesburg section of Philadelphia.  In addition to these destructive wind gusts, frequent to continuous cloud to ground lightning, heavy rain, and a few instances of hail were also reported throughout the area.  ||Tragically, four deaths were reported in eastern Pennsylvania as a result of these severe wind gusts.  Three fatalities in Montgomery County were due directly to falling trees.  The fourth fatality in Delaware County was due to a house fire caused by an electrical malfunction from a fallen tree.  This is the highest number of fatalities from a derecho event in Pennsylvania since 1950.  ||Over 208,000 power outages were reported in southeastern Pennsylvania as a result |of fallen trees on power lines.  Some localities were without power for several days. Numerous road closures were also reported due to fallen trees.|A seven story 150 unit apartment building took severe roof damage in Lansdale Borough, Montgomery County. The Montgomery County Community Based COVID-19 Testing Site shut down at noon due to the storms. Personnel took shelter and reported minor property damage.||Because this derecho moved off the coast by 130 PM, the warm afternoon sun was able to sufficiently destabilize the atmosphere for the formation of another round of severe thunderstorms over some of the same areas that experience them earlier in the day.  Reported wind gusts associated with these thunderstorms generally ranged between 45 and 65 MPH, with a 65 MPH wind gust measured at the Philadelphia International Airport.  The remaining thunderstorms then moved offshore by 1000 PM, which brought an end to the day's severe weather.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tree fell on the roof of a car killing one person in Lower Merion along Medford Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A hot, moist, and tropical air mass entered the region behind the front for June 10th, resulting in high temperatures in the upper 80s and lower 90s and dew points in the 70s across the region. Heat indices in Northwest Ohio reached the upper 90s during the afternoon of the 10th. A shortwave trough and associated surface cold front entered from the west, allowing for showers and thunderstorms to develop over western Ohio around 3 PM on the 10th in the warm, unstable air mass. Storms began as discrete or clustered cells over western Ohio before congealing into a squall line. This squall line propagated from west to east across northern Ohio but individual cell motion was from south-southwest to north-northeast as the line moved through northern Ohio on the evening of the 10th. The main threat from severe thunderstorms were damaging winds with the strongest winds occurring in Northwest Ohio. Storms produced wind gusts up to 80 mph in the Lake Erie Islands and adjacent mainland areas of Ottawa and Erie Counties in Ohio, with wind damage across Oak Harbor, Catawba Island, Port Clinton, Marblehead, South Bass Island, and Sandusky. Another powerful segment of the line moved across Marion County, including the city of Marion, prompting sporadic damage in the city with wind gusts up to 80 mph. There was one injury with this event in Marion as a facade of a building collapsed onto a nearby vehicle. The intensity of the squall line waned as it passed east of Interstate 71, though it remained severe with sporadic wind damage. As the squall line moved east of Interstate 77 after dark, the line intensified as the storms caught up to the outflow, and backed winds ahead of the line rejuvenated the thunderstorms. Some strong storms moved across Trumbull and Mahoning Counties, producing additional wind damage before moving into Pennsylvania.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Marion County Emergency Management provided evidence of significant wind damage across the Marion area due to severe thunderstorm winds of up to 80 mph. Numerous trees and power lines were downed across the city with several large trees falling onto residences. Winds ripped off a significant portion of a roof of an industrial building on the west side of Marion. Winds also caused the brick facade of a building in downtown Marion to collapse onto a vehicle. The vehicle was occupied at the time of the damage and the female occupant sustained minor injuries. There was also evidence on social media that a gustnado may have formed with the squall line that moved through the Marion area just before 6 pm local time.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 125.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These initial storms grew upscale given concurrent downstream destabilization through northeast Nebraska and northwest Iowa. Widespread 80-100 mph winds developed through central/eastern Iowa as this derecho matured. Northern bookend and advection wing forcing led to some supercell structures across northern Illinois/southwest Wisconsin. Northern bookend turned northeast as it moved across Lake Michigan and tracked into western Michigan. As this occurred, attendant post convective wake low weakened as it crossed the lake. Thus the local area did not experience the 80 to 100 mph winds that N IL/E IA experienced. However the resultant slowing and breakup of the line as it moved across northwest Indiana/SW Michigan, yielded a LEWP and subsequent multiple small scale circulations developing along the line. These meso-vortices were associated with pockets of enhanced wind damage and brief tornado occurrences.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A mobile home rolled due to a failure of 1 or more properly secured straps from strong winds.

The home rolled into an adjacent double wide mobile home. The initial mobile home was destroyed but all debris remained near the site. The adjacent mobile home suffered damage to the side and roof due to the home striking it.

Just before noon Thursday, September 10, 2020, a resident used his drone to help rescuers scan the area. They located the body 100 yards away from the car in a flooded field near a fence. They found the deceased body in a field the next day on 9/10 and it was a 71 year old male. At approximately 3:30 pm, on 9/16/20, the body of a 62 year old male, who was a passenger in the same vehicle, was recovered in the Red Mud Creek area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This continued through February 7th, highlighted by heavy rainfall from the evening of February 5th through the first half of February 6th. Rain amounts of 4-6 inches fell across much of southeastern Kentucky over this period. This led to major flooding and numerous mudslides across portions of Whitley, Perry, Letcher, Leslie, Knox, Harlan, Clay, and Bell Counties. The Governor subsequently declared a State of Emergency for these 8 counties.||Major flooding occurred along the Cumberland River at Pineville, Barbourville, and Williamsburg. Additionally, the communities of Loyall and Baxter experienced major flooding. Numerous roads became impassable across large portions of Whitley, Knox, Clay, Leslie, Letcher, Harlan, Perry, and Bell counties. In particular, Harlan County was hit extremely hard with the Kentucky Mesonet site on Black Mountain (4031 foot elevation) receiving over 6.5 inches of rain over this stretch. ||Flood gates were closed in Pineville and Harlan, further impacting local travel. A couple of mobile homes were flooded and swept down the Cumberland River in Harlan County, while swift water rescues took place in Bell and Harlan Counties.

A man went missing in Whitley County and was later found deceased in his car on Kentucky Highway 779 after his attempt to drive into flood waters. A total of seven homes were reported to have been in or under water across Whitley County as the Cumberland River in Williamsburg crested to its third highest stage on record of 34.84 feet. The city of Pineville saw the river rise to its second highest crest in history at 1019.06 feet, leading to several families being stranded without homes.||While impacts were certainly greatest along the Cumberland River, several portions of the Kentucky River also flooded. Several roads were impacted in Hazard and Whitesburg, while Booneville, Heidelberg, and Ravenna also exceeded flood stage. Along the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River, a rarity occurred as Pikeville hit flood stage and forced the city to shut its flood gates.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Emergency Management reported extensive flooding in Williamsburg and elsewhere across Whitley County, especially east of town.

Snow levels rose to near 5000 feet.   The heavy rain and snow melt lead to moderate flooding and several landslides along the East Slopes of the Washington Cascades. There was record flooding on several rivers, including the Umatilla, Walla Walla and Touchet rivers with widespread flooding of numerous other creeks and streams and rivers across Umatilla, Union and Wallowa Counties of Oregon and Walla Walla and Columbia Counties of Washington. Initial Weather Conditions February 1, 2020, snowpack across along the East Slopes of the Washington Cascades ranged from 80 to 100 percent of normal.   Across the northern Blue Mountains of Oregon and northern Blue mountains of Washington the snowpack was near normal. A weather system brought heavy snow to this region on February 4th and the first part of the day on February 5th with snow amounts from around 10 to 20 inches for locations between 2000 to 4000 feet. During the afternoon of the 5th, snow changed to rain at elevations below 5000 feet.  Selected locations snow amounts for February 4-5, include 8 inches at 2.6 miles SSE of Snoqualmie Pass, 7 inches at Cle Elum, 2 inches at Easton, 12.5 inches at Ski Blue Wood and 2 inches at Dayton in Columbia County. For Oregon, snow amounts include, La Grande 7-10 inches, Summerville 10 inches, La Grande, 5 Miles NNE- 17.5 inches, Meacham 13 inches, Elgin 9.8 N 8 inches, Joseph 6 inches and Wallowa 8 inches. The rain continued over through February 6 and 7th. Precipitation amounts in the form of rain at the headwaters of the rivers, ranged from 3 to 5 inches.  Rain amounts for the 48 hours ending on the morning of February 8th, for selected locations include 6.31 inches at 2.6 miles SSE of Snoqualmie Pass, 3.27 inches at Easton, 5.83 inches near Lake Cle Elum and 2.17 inches at 8.7 miles NE Dayton.  Snotel sites reported 2 day precipitation amounts of 6.3 inches at Touchet #2 in the Columbia County. There was 1.98 inches over 72 hours at 1.1 NE Walla Walla.   In Oregon, rain amounts for the 48 hours ending on the morning of February 8th for selected locations include:  from Coop Observer, Emigrant Springs ��� 2.82 inches, Union 1.01 inches ,  Cove- 2.48 inches, La Grande - 2.50 inches,  Lostine ��� 1.39 inches.  From CoCoRahs and other public weather spotters, 9.8 N Elgin ��� 5.45 inches, La Grande- 3.02 inches and Wallowa 2.66 inches.  Snotel sites reported 2 day precipitation amounts of 5.9 inches at High Ridge, 3.0 inches at Moss Springs, 1.6 inches at Milkshake. In addition, the snowpack from the preceding day was melted, contributing to the runoff.  Observations show 5 to 7 inches of snow melted from February 5th to February 6th at Easton and Cle Elum. Home owners in the Lake Cle Elum area noted a loss of 3 to 5 feet of snow An observer located 5 miles north of La Grande reported 17.5 inches of snow fell on February 4-5 and then by the morning of February 6th, the snow depth had decreased to around 8 inches and was depleted during the day on the 6th.   Satellite snowpack images show 1-3 inches of snow water equivalent (or water held in the snowpack) melted out along both the east and west sides of the northern Blue Mountains in Oregon and around the foothills of the Grande Ronde Valley generally between 2000 to 4000 feet. Streams, creeks and rivers rose rapidly through the night of February 5th, with the first instance of flooding reported on early morning on February 6th.  The streams and rivers continued the rapid rises through the day on February 6th, with the Umatilla River reaching record high water levels at the gaging sites near Gibbon and at Pendleton and moderate flooding on the Grande Ronde River at the gaging sites near Perry and Troy. Most rivers and streams crested overnight on February 6th or on the morning of February 7th and then slowly receded back below flood stage on February 8th and 9th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Umatilla County ��� There was record flooding along the entire reach of the Umatilla River.  There was extensive damage to areas along the river, including homes, roads including Interstate 84, railroads  as well as other public facilities such as parks and sports complexes.  Along the upper reaches of the river, roads were washed out with homes damaged or destroyed.  One resident was swept away by flood waters and died.  A number of residents had to be evacuated via helicopter or 4 wheeler with 70 homes on the Umatilla Indian Reservation damaged.  The Riverview Mobile Home Park at Pendleton was inundated.  There was minimal to no damage through Pendleton, due to the levee, but the Bob White Baseball field had extensive damage as water overtopped a low wall.  Adjacent to Pendleton, the levee was damaged and overtopped with water flowing through the Keystone RV Manufacturing plant and the Colby Pipe Company.  Several bridges and roads downstream from Reith to Echo were damaged or washed out with a number of homes damaged.   Downstream from Echo to the confluence of Columbia River, the river rose out of the banks and flooded Interstate 84 between Highway 395 and Highway 208.  Several semi-trucks were stranded in the flood waters with extensive damage to the highway.  Numerous pastures and buildings along the river through Stanfield were flooded with extensive damage to Oxbow Park in Hermiston and to a sports complex in Umatilla.

One of these supercells formed near the Mississippi River in west Tennessee, then tracked eastward across the entire length of the state just north of the Interstate 40 corridor, spawning 10 tornadoes and dropping large hail bigger than the size of baseballs. Seven of these tornadoes touched down across Middle Tennessee, resulting in widespread damage, 307 injuries and 24 fatalities. An additional fatality and 2 more injuries occurred in Benton County in west Tennessee. These tornadoes were the worst seen in Tennessee since the devastating tornadoes of April 27, 2011 across east Tennessee, as well as the Super Tuesday tornadoes of February 5-6, 2008. Total damage estimates from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency across Middle Tennessee reached $1.6 billion.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An historic, violent EF-4 tornado began in western Putnam County northwest of Baxter and tracked eastward for over 8 miles before lifting near downtown Cookeville, damaging or destroying dozens of homes and businesses, killing 19 people, and injuring 88 others. The tornado began 2.5 miles northwest of Baxter along Highway 70 where it caused EF-0 damage to several homes and outbuildings. Scattered trees were blown down as the tornado continued eastward across Gainesboro Highway. The tornado quickly intensified to EF-2 in the Prosperity Pointe subdivision just north of Highway 70 and further strengthened to EF-3 as it crossed Bloomington Road and Clemmons Road in the Double Springs community, severely damaging several homes. As the tornado moved across Charleston Square, Plunk Whitson Road, and North McBloom Chapel Road, it intensified even more and produced a 0.8 mile long by 100 yards wide swath of EF-4 damage. 17 well-constructed, large homes in this area were completely leveled, mostly on Hensley Drive, with many deaths occurring in this area. EF-4 damage continued eastward to Echo Valley Drive, where an apartment complex and 5 more homes were completely destroyed. The tornado weakened to EF-3 as it crossed Highway 70 and Locust Grove Road, where numerous more homes and buildings were damaged or destroyed. A dashcam video of the tornado was taken from an unoccupied vehicle on Willow Brook Drive in this area. Continuing along Highway 70, the tornado weakened further to EF-2 intensity as it crossed County Farm Road and Jackson Street, then down to EF-1 strength along Crescent Drive and Buck Avenue. The tornado rapdily dissipated as it entered the downtown area of Cookeville, quickly lifting on Laurel Avenue just west of Cookeville Regional Medical Center. This was the worst tornado on record to affect Putnam County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One of these supercells formed near the Mississippi River in west Tennessee, then tracked eastward across the entire length of the state just north of the Interstate 40 corridor, spawning 10 tornadoes and dropping large hail bigger than the size of baseballs. Seven of these tornadoes touched down across Middle Tennessee, resulting in widespread damage, 307 injuries and 24 fatalities. An additional fatality and 2 more injuries occurred in Benton County in west Tennessee. These tornadoes were the worst seen in Tennessee since the devastating tornadoes of April 27, 2011 across east Tennessee, as well as the Super Tuesday tornadoes of February 5-6, 2008. Total damage estimates from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency across Middle Tennessee reached $1.6 billion.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An historic, violent EF-4 tornado began in western Putnam County northwest of Baxter and tracked eastward for over 8 miles before lifting near downtown Cookeville, damaging or destroying dozens of homes and businesses, killing 19 people, and injuring 88 others. The tornado began 2.5 miles northwest of Baxter along Highway 70 where it caused EF-0 damage to several homes and outbuildings. Scattered trees were blown down as the tornado continued eastward across Gainesboro Highway. The tornado quickly intensified to EF-2 in the Prosperity Pointe subdivision just north of Highway 70 and further strengthened to EF-3 as it crossed Bloomington Road and Clemmons Road in the Double Springs community, severely damaging several homes. As the tornado moved across Charleston Square, Plunk Whitson Road, and North McBloom Chapel Road, it intensified even more and produced a 0.8 mile long by 100 yards wide swath of EF-4 damage. 17 well-constructed, large homes in this area were completely leveled, mostly on Hensley Drive, with many deaths occurring in this area. EF-4 damage continued eastward to Echo Valley Drive, where an apartment complex and 5 more homes were completely destroyed. The tornado weakened to EF-3 as it crossed Highway 70 and Locust Grove Road, where numerous more homes and buildings were damaged or destroyed. A dashcam video of the tornado was taken from an unoccupied vehicle on Willow Brook Drive in this area. Continuing along Highway 70, the tornado weakened further to EF-2 intensity as it crossed County Farm Road and Jackson Street, then down to EF-1 strength along Crescent Drive and Buck Avenue. The tornado rapdily dissipated as it entered the downtown area of Cookeville, quickly lifting on Laurel Avenue just west of Cookeville Regional Medical Center. This was the worst tornado on record to affect Putnam County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A supercell thunderstorm developed and moved across portions of the Pine Belt and brought a violent tornado across the region, for the second time in as many weeks.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This violent tornado began over southeastern Walthall County in a field just west of Reagan Road and moved east northeastward along MS Highway 48, producing significant tree damage and minor damage to a few homes. It crossed into Marion County near the intersection of MS Highway 48 and Mt Bethel Road. The tornado then began to move more northeastward as it moved into southwestern Marion County, uprooting and snapping several softwood trees, causing minor roof damage to a home, and destroying an outdoor small shed along New Hope Road. It also snapped several trees and peeled the tin roof of a barn along A Pittman, Marks and Davis Roads. The tornado intensified relatively quickly once it moved northeast, snapping the majority of trees close to the ground in a wooded area east of New Hope Road. The basis for the low-end EF4 rating was a home on Johnson Road that was completely destroyed with its debris pushed to a corner of the foundation leaving residual vinyl flooring and a few of its anchor bolts bent. Furthermore, across the street from the aforementioned home, in a field a few of the snapped trees sustained patchy debarking. A higher rating was not assigned because the contents of the home were not spread a significant distance from the foundation and debris remained over a part of the slab. Nonetheless, significant damage to the home and nearby trees occurred. In addition, multiple wooden power poles were snapped, several other homes had significant roof damage and multiple mobile homes were completely destroyed, resulting in one fatality. Continual uprooting and snapping of trees was observed at Hurricane Creek Road, in addition to minor roof damage to a shed and a one-story home. When the tornado crossed Hurricane Creek Church Road, it caused significant roof damage to the Hurricane Creek Baptist Church and the nearby pastor's home. Behind the pastor's home was a large 40-foot shed that sat partially on cinder blocks and partially on a slab that was bolted down. This shed was completely destroyed as it was blown a few feet away. Several headstones in a cemetery were knocked over at this location as well. Additional roof damage to multiple homes and the uprooting and snapping of numerous trees along Hurricane Creek Road to the intersection of MS Highway 35. When the tornado reached MS Highway 35, it snapped multiple wooden power-poles and continued snapping trees. It continued east- northeast to Old MS Highway 35 causing numerous snapping of hardwood trees and the removal of a portion of a one-story home roof. The tornado continued moving east-northeast across the Pearl River bottom, when it reached MS Highway 43, multiple wooden power-poles were snapped, some minor roof damage occurred to some one-story homes and hardwood trees were snapped. Just east of MS Highway 43 along Joe Magee Road, a brick home sustained significant damage as the roof was completely destroyed and a few exterior walls were collapsed. A swath of snapped softwood trees was noted along Abrams Road thus producing EF2 damage.||Once the tornado reached MS Highway 13 and surrounding streets such as Pine Burr Road and Firetower Road near the Marion and Lamar county borders, a slight decline in strength was noted, though its path remained wide. Although, it was still snapping large tree limbs and snapping and uprooting some softwood trees, several of which fell onto wooden power poles and caused them to fall. The tornado maintained its east northeastward track, knocking thousands of trees down along with numerous power lines and poles down across the western portions of Lamar County. This tree damage was consistent with high end EF1 winds peaking between 100-110 mph. Around a dozen homes were damaged starting from Luther Saucier Rd to Purvis to Columbia Road, including one old mobile home that was completely destroyed. As the tornado continued to track east northeastward to the north of Purvis. It crossed Purvis Oloh Road, MS Highway 589 along with US 11. Hundreds of trees were damaged along with many power lines down. Some minor damage occurred to some homes. The tornado was slightly weaker here with winds between 90- 100mph. The tornado crossed I-59 into Forrest County along Ford and Elks Lodge Road in the Dixie community. Hundreds of trees were damaged along with many power lines down. Sheds and several homes had minor damage and one mobile home had the roof blown off. The tornado then crossed US 49 a couple miles north of Southgate Road. The tornado proceeded into Camp Shelby. At Camp Shelby, there were widespread snapped and uprooted trees. Multiple structures across the north half, in and around Lee Avenue to Glenn Walker Lake, had varying degrees of minor to moderate roof damage from the tornado or fallen trees. The park and camper area on the north end of the lake was impacted. One person was injured here as a large tree fell on a truck. The tornado then crossed over US 98 just west of the Perry County line. It continued into Perry County along the Leaf River bottom, snapping and uprooting trees. It continued to track just south of Old River Road before dissipating along Old River Road three miles northwest of New Augusta. Total path length was 53.76 miles. Maximum sustained winds for the entire tornado were 170 mph, but were noted to be 100 mph in Forrest County. Total path width was 2275 yards(1.29 miles).<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado strengthened significantly and widened to 0.65 miles wide as it crossed the Cumberland River into the John C. Tune Airport area, causing strong EF-2 damage to numerous planes, hangers, warehouses, and other buildings from Cockrill Bend Way to Briley Parkway. Around $200 million in damage was reported at John C. Tune Airport alone. Continuing eastward, the tornado caused severe damage to the Tennessee State Prison and blew down numerous high-tension transmission towers as it again crossed the Cumberland River into North Nashville, with up to EF-2 damage to farm facilities at Tennessee State University and dozens of homes between I-40 and Buchanan Street. EF-2 damage continued across the Germantown neighborhood just 1/2 mile north of downtown Nashville with several damaged and destroyed apartment complexes, homes, and businesses. The tornado intensified further as it tracked through East Nashville, with EF-3 damage to businesses and other buildings in the Five Points area and EF-2 damage to homes in the Lockeland Springs and Barclay Drive neighborhoods. Two people were killed in Five Points after leaving a bar and going outside as the tornado struck. After crossing the Cumberland River yet again, the tornado weakened as it moved northeast through the Donelson Hills and Lincoya Hills neighborhoods of Donelson, but strengthened again to a strong EF-3 in the Standford Estates area where several homes were leveled. The tornado weakened slightly but continued to cause EF-2 damage to homes and businesses as it turned southeast and passed through Hermitage into Wilson County. ||Dozens of homes continued to sustain up to EF-2 damage as the tornado moved across the Chandler Road and Triple Crown Parkway neighborhoods of Mount Juliet. Turning more to the northeast, the tornado strenghtened to strong EF-3 and leveled numerous homes in the Catalpa Drive and Clearview Drive neighborhoods, with one elderly couple killed on Catalpa Drive at Dogwood Drive. Crossing Mount Juliet Road, the tornado severely damaged West Wilson Middle School and Stoner Creek Elementary School, both of which will have to be torn down and rebuilt. The tornado reached its peak intensity of high-end EF-3 and peak size of 0.9 miles wide as it moved across Golden Bear Parkway and along Eastgate Blvd, leveling several large warehouses and killing a security guard at the CEVA warehouse on Athletes Way North. Crossing Highway 109 into Lebanon, the tornado weakened to EF-2 but continued damaging dozens of homes and businesses as it moved through southern sections of the city. Further to the east, buildings on both sides of I-40 in Tuckers Crossroads received up to EF-2 damage before the tornado turned southeast and crossed into Smith County. Weakening and shrinking in size, the tornado caused EF-1 damage to numerous homes and businesses in Grant, New Middleton, and just south of Gordonsville. The tornado finally lifted east of Highway 141 and north of Judkins Lane after a continuous 60.13 miles on the ground.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.09B<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Strong southerly winds drew unseasonably warm, moist air northward into the region ahead of a cold front. Early morning temperatures were in the upper 60s and lower 70s with dewpoints in the upper 60s. This aided in the development of uncapped surface-based instability that was more than sufficient to maintain the QLCS. A strengthening  shortwave trough was lifting northeastward across the Ozarks during the event resulting in strengthing wind fields and ample wind shear.  The QLCS evolved into a Line Echo Wave Pattern (LEWP) with several persistent mesovortices across north Mississippi and a few transient mesovortices farther north into west Tennessee. Widespread damaging wind was observed across the entire County Warning Area (CWA) along with 13 tornadoes. In addition to the severe weather potential, heavy rainfall was a noted threat.

Strong southerly winds drew unseasonably warm, moist air northward into the region ahead of a cold front. Early morning temperatures were in the upper 60s and lower 70s with dewpoints in the upper 60s. This aided in the development of uncapped surface-based instability that was more than sufficient to maintain the QLCS. A strengthening  shortwave trough was lifting northeastward across the Ozarks during the event resulting in strengthing wind fields and ample wind shear.  The QLCS evolved into a Line Echo Wave Pattern (LEWP) with several persistent mesovortices across north Mississippi and a few transient mesovortices farther north into west Tennessee. Widespread damaging wind was observed across the entire County Warning Area (CWA) along with 13 tornadoes. In addition to the severe weather potential, heavy rainfall was a noted threat.

A tornado developed near the South Bend region, where damage occurred to several homes and businesses. The tornado continued moving northeast, paralleling HWY 67 toward Graham. The tornado then veered slightly to the east as it approached Sidney Mountain, crossing HWY 67 just south of Rosser Ranch Rd. The tornado struck multiple homes along Rosser Ranch Rd, leaving behind a swath of damage before moving over open fields again.

One storm in particular went from southeast Boone County into southern Marion County and northwest Baxter County. The storm had strong rotation at times and it headed quickly to the northeast at 40 to 50 mph. There was plenty of chaos in the path of the storm, and no doubt that one or more tornadoes were in play.||A house was damaged east of Everton (Boone County), and power lines were downed. Between Pyatt and Bruno (both in Marion County), several homes were damaged or destroyed with an injury reported. A school was also affected. A tree fell through a house west of Mountain Home (Baxter County).||In the end, two tornadoes (rated EF1/EF2) were spawned in a three county area. Three more weak tornadoes (all rated EF1) were confirmed with separate storms from five miles north of Hector (Pope County) to six miles west-southwest of Rupert (Van Buren County), and from four miles northeast of Evening Shade to four miles north of Poughkeepsie (both in Sharp County). These tornadoes toppled trees and hit a couple of barns and outbuildings.||This event did not feature a lot of rain, and there was only 0.01 inch measured at Little Rock (Pulaski County) on the 19th.

Through southeast Boone County, the tornado uprooted and snapped trees, then moved across the southeast portion of Everton. There, the roof of a house was torn off and several trees were snapped at mid-trunk level. ||The tornado then tracked into Marion County where it uprooted trees. Near the intersection of County Roads 4019 and 4023, it destroyed a hay barn. Several large trees were uprooted and the porch was ripped off of a home. Several trees and power poles were downed and snapped. Before crossing Meadowcrest Lane and County Road 4019, it uprooted and snapped power poles and trees, caused extensive damage to a house, and destroyed an outbuilding. The tornado crossed Arkansas Highway 125 south near Eros and damaged the Bruno-Pyatt School. East of Eros, the tornado caused severe damage to a residence and destroyed its garage. Near the intersection of County Roads 4018 and 4010, several houses had severe damage. One person had a minor injury but was reportedly in good condition. The final damage points were WSW of Yellville, where several large trees were uprooted, power poles were broken, and a residence sustained roof damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 275.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It is at Airport Road where one injury was reported due to a tree falling on a home. It then moved east-northeast to US Highway 278, breaking 8 to 10 wooden electrical poles. It moved to the northeast of the Lake Village community where it continued to knock down wooden electrical poles and began to uproot and snap large branches from softwood trees along North Lakeshore Drive and along the shore of Lake Chicot. The Lake Village Country Club along North Lakeshore Drive took damage to its roof on the backside. In addition, on the backside of the Country Club, a nearby forested area had multiple snapped large hardwood tree limbs in addition to the tin roof of a metal storage building peeled completely off. Also along North Lakeshore Drive, multiple trees were uprooted and snapped at a trailer park, where one trailer was blown across the street to near the bottom of Lake Chicot. As the tornado continued to track northeast, it moved along AR Highway 144, uprooting trees and snapping large hardwood limbs. Five electrical power poles were downed along Highway 144, as well as another trailer getting rolled to near the bottom of Lake Chicot.  The tornado continued to snap large limbs and uproot hardwood trees as it moved across Pecan Ridge Drive. The tornado continued to just north of Levee Road where it lifted, but not before a few uprooting hardwood trees and snapping small to medium sized limbs. It is important to note that a large swath of severe wind speeds resulted in widespread downed trees on Lakehall Road, Sunnyside Road, Stuart Island Road and at the Lake Chicot State Park. Several of these trees fell on power lines causing outages to a large portion of the Lake Village community. This tornado then continued east-northeast across the MS River to across Lake Ferguson in Washington County, where the second floor was blown off of a lake house on South Ferguson Road. In addition, a high concentration of snapped and uprooted hardwood trees was noted on the backside of the lakehouse on South Ferguson Road, thus resulting in the upgraded EF-2 rating. It continued to move east to Highway 1 North where it snapped small to large hardwood tree limbs before dissipating. Estimated peak wind with this tornado was 127 mph. Max width was 850 yards. Total path length was 17.81 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Tree damage could be seen from atop the levee just west of Benoit. The tornado tracked through farmland just north of Benoit where it knocked down trees and power lines. It also damaged heavy farm equipment and destroyed a farm equipment shelter, ripping and tossing its concrete anchors over 100 yards. The tornado then crossed Highway 1, where it destroyed some large grain bins and snapped numerous power poles. The tornado proceeded into the Dahomey National Wildlife Refuge where it knocked down trees and power poles. The most substantial damage was noted as the tornado crossed Highway 8 between Pace and Cleveland. It snapped more than 40 wooden power poles along Highway 8. The tornado uprooted and snapped trees and damaged some well built homes in the area northwest of Cleveland. This is also the area where the tornado snapped several concrete power poles. Several mobile homes were destroyed along South Bayou Road, injuring three people. More mobile homes were destroyed on McCain Road, injuring one person. The tornado proceeded to cross US 61 where it snapped more power poles and damaged homes near Tolliver Road. It also damaged some steel power trusses and a business along US 61 in Renova. The tornado lifted east of US 61 before crossing into Sunflower County. Maximum peak winds were estimated around 130 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Tree damage could be seen from atop the levee just west of Benoit. The tornado tracked through farmland just north of Benoit where it knocked down trees and power lines. It also damaged heavy farm equipment and destroyed a farm equipment shelter, ripping and tossing its concrete anchors over 100 yards. The tornado then crossed Highway 1, where it destroyed some large grain bins and snapped numerous power poles. The tornado proceeded into the Dahomey National Wildlife Refuge where it knocked down trees and power poles. The most substantial damage was noted as the tornado crossed Highway 8 between Pace and Cleveland. It snapped more than 40 wooden power poles along Highway 8. The tornado uprooted and snapped trees and damaged some well built homes in the area northwest of Cleveland. This is also the area where the tornado snapped several concrete power poles. Several mobile homes were destroyed along South Bayou Road, injuring three people. More mobile homes were destroyed on McCain Road, injuring one person. The tornado proceeded to cross US 61 where it snapped more power poles and damaged homes near Tolliver Road. It also damaged some steel power trusses and a business along US 61 in Renova. The tornado lifted east of US 61 before crossing into Sunflower County. Maximum peak winds were estimated around 130 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Meanwhile, a strong upper level low opened up into a trough as it entered the Southern Plains during the evening of the 11th, with large scale forcing ahead of the trough enhancing shower and thunderstorm development across much of West-central, Central, East and Southeast Texas during the evening through the early morning hours. Given the extent of shear, instability, and upper level forcing in place across the warm sector, numerous showers and thunderstorms developed over these areas, which quickly spread east northeast into East Texas around and shortly after daybreak on the 12th, and into North Louisiana during the mid and late morning hours. Some of these storms were severe, producing numerous reports of damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes. In all, nine tornadoes touched down across North Louisiana, including two EF-3 tornadoes with estimated maximum winds near 140 mph which tore through the southern sections of West Monroe through Central and Eastern Monroe, as well as just southwest of Sterlington in Northern Ouachita Parish. ||While there was a lull in the thunderstorms during much of the afternoon, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed across portions of Northeast Texas well behind the dry line which had mixed east to near Texarkana into Western Louisiana, and near the center of the upper level trough. Steep lapse rates aloft and the drier low level air mass contributed to areas of damaging winds and isolated instances of large hail, with the majority of the wind damage from a collapsing thunderstorm which originated just east of Dallas, and quickly moved east along the I-20 corridor in East Texas into Western Louisiana. Aided by strong pressure rises behind an associated cold front, a large swath of damaging winds were noted with the severe gust front, with gusts ranging from 50-70 mph well ahead of the collapsed storm. This resulted in numerous reports of downed trees and power lines across East Texas and Western Louisiana, with AEP Swepco noting that over 64,000 customers were without power at one time in the aftermath of the storms. These damaging winds diminished across Western Louisiana by mid-evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF-2 tornado with estimated maximum winds around 125 mph touched down along Adams Road and downed hundreds of trees as it crossed Simpton Road, Myrtle Hill Road, and Willie X Road. Along Willie X Road, it damaged the shingles of three single family homes and a church. As the tornado crossed Highway 5, it strengthened and completely destroyed three single wide manufactured homes, ripped the roof off and collapsed the walls of two homes, shifted a portion of a home off its foundation while ripping its roof off, and then damaged an exterior wall and a carport in addition to ripping portions of the roof off of a fourth home. One of the manufactured homes destroyed had five residents inside when the tornado struck, and all five survived, with only one of the five injured while the others only experienced minor bumps and bruises.

Further to the northeast, minor tree damage was once again observed on Opossum Hollow Road and an outbuilding was destroyed. On Grant Highway, several buildings were damaged at the Grant Cedar Mill, which also sustained damage from the EF-3 Nashville/Mount Juliet/Lebanon Tornado on March 3, 2020. From there, the tornado path became very difficult to determine as it crossed the wide damage path from the March 3rd EF-3 tornado into an area with no public roadways, and is estimated to have ended east of Grant Highway where some damaged trees could be seen. However, the tornado path may be extended eastward in the future once high resolution satellite imagery is available.

From there, the tornado path became very difficult to determine as it crossed the wide damage path from the March 3rd EF-3 tornado into an area with no public roadways, and is estimated to have ended east of Grant Highway where some damaged trees could be seen. However, the tornado path may be extended eastward in the future once high resolution satellite imagery is available. The combined tornado path across Wilson and Smith Counties was estimated to be 3.81 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Some of the most significant damage was in Paradise Acres area of Onalaska. Winds possibly reached 140 mph as the storm moved across this location, which was the only EF3 damage the NWS could confirm along the 30 mile track. The tornado killed three and injured 33 in Onalaska with 291 homes affected and 46 destroyed. It was estimated to be about 500 yards wide as it moved across the town. The tornado continued a general east-|northeastward track across rural Polk county where it snapped and uprooted numerous hardwood and softwood trees and intermittently damaged structures. The tornado path was measured at just over a half-mile wide as it crossed Highway 59 near Seven Oaks, where EF2 damage was surveyed with destruction of two mobile homes and |damage to hardwood trees. The tornado remained in rural areas until it ended very close to Barnes in northeast Polk county. Near the end of the track, a large tree destroyed a mobile home and miraculously just missed a man who was sitting at his computer. He was not seriously injured. For historical context, this was the deadliest single tornado for the NWS Houston-Galveston forecast area since Nov 15th, 1987 when a tornado also killed three in Madison County. The deadliest tornado on record for this area is the F4 in Galveston which killed 8 during Hurricane Carla in 1961.

From the Storm Prediction Center (Day 1) convective outlook, just about the entire area was under an ENHANCED risk for severe weather with a MODERATE risk extending from the ArkLaMiss into western Georgia.||In addition, enhanced rainfall occurred over far north Georgia and in portions of central Georgia, with rainfall amounts ranging from 3 to 8 inches through the event.

The tornado touched down along Mitchell Bridge Road, just northwest of the Indian Trace Golf Course where several trees were snapped. The tornado moved northeast crossing Highway 286 and Twin Lakes Road where a few trees were snapped or uprooted and|minor damage occurred to several homes. The tornado appeared to briefly strengthen around Ellis Circle where there was more notable exterior damage to homes and a greater number of trees uprooted. As the tornado continued northeast crossing Fullers Chapel Road, noticeable strengthening occurred. Aerial drone footage showed a wide swath of large trees blown down just before Norton Bridge Road. At least 8 double-wide manufactured homes were completely destroyed along Deer Park Drive, with several others sustaining some degree of damage. It was here the tornado quickly strengthened to EF2 intensity with winds around 125 MPH. Similar, significant, damage was seen along Ridgeview Lane and Fieldview Court, where additional manufactured homes were destroyed and a recently built cell tower was left crumpled by the intense winds. At this point, the tornado reached its peak intensity with maximum wind speeds around 135 MPH. The tornado maintained its EF2 intensity as it crossed over Zion Church Hill Road, just before Highway 225. As the strong tornado crossed Highway 225, a small single-family home was heavily damaged with just a couple of interior walls left standing. Along Jim Petty Road, 4 large chicken houses were damaged or destroyed with the debris thrown several hundred yards away.  Further north along Jim Petty Road, near Hawkins Road, the damage appeared to lessen quickly with just a few trees blown down and minor roof damage to a shed. Some additional damage, mainly trees being snapped or uprooted, was seen along Halls Chapel Road, just before Temple Grove road. The tornado lifted just beyond this point, along Sumac Ridge. Eight people were killed and around 2 dozen injured in the area between Fullers Chapel Road and Jim Petty Road.

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes.

Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred.

Severe thunderstorms moved across central and southern portions of the area during the afternoon and evening hours of the 19th. A supercell thunderstorm developed and moved across portions of the Pine Belt and brought a violent tornado across the region, for the second time in as many weeks.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This violent tornado began over southeastern Walthall County in a field just west of Reagan Road and moved east northeastward along MS Highway 48, producing significant tree damage and minor damage to a few homes. It crossed into Marion County near the intersection of MS Highway 48 and Mt Bethel Road. The tornado then began to move more northeastward as it moved into southwestern Marion County, uprooting and snapping several softwood trees, causing minor roof damage to a home, and destroying an outdoor small shed along New Hope Road. It also snapped several trees and peeled the tin roof of a barn along A Pittman, Marks and Davis Roads. The tornado intensified relatively quickly once it moved northeast, snapping the majority of trees close to the ground in a wooded area east of New Hope Road. The basis for the low-end EF4 rating was a home on Johnson Road that was completely destroyed with its debris pushed to a corner of the foundation leaving residual vinyl flooring and a few of its anchor bolts bent. Furthermore, across the street from the aforementioned home, in a field a few of the snapped trees sustained patchy debarking. A higher rating was not assigned because the contents of the home were not spread a significant distance from the foundation and debris remained over a part of the slab. Nonetheless, significant damage to the home and nearby trees occurred. In addition, multiple wooden power poles were snapped, several other homes had significant roof damage and multiple mobile homes were completely destroyed, resulting in one fatality. Continual uprooting and snapping of trees was observed at Hurricane Creek Road, in addition to minor roof damage to a shed and a one-story home. When the tornado crossed Hurricane Creek Church Road, it caused significant roof damage to the Hurricane Creek Baptist Church and the nearby pastor's home. Behind the pastor's home was a large 40-foot shed that sat partially on cinder blocks and partially on a slab that was bolted down. This shed was completely destroyed as it was blown a few feet away. Several headstones in a cemetery were knocked over at this location as well. Additional roof damage to multiple homes and the uprooting and snapping of numerous trees along Hurricane Creek Road to the intersection of MS Highway 35. When the tornado reached MS Highway 35, it snapped multiple wooden power-poles and continued snapping trees. It continued east- northeast to Old MS Highway 35 causing numerous snapping of hardwood trees and the removal of a portion of a one-story home roof. The tornado continued moving east-northeast across the Pearl River bottom, when it reached MS Highway 43, multiple wooden power-poles were snapped, some minor roof damage occurred to some one-story homes and hardwood trees were snapped. Just east of MS Highway 43 along Joe Magee Road, a brick home sustained significant damage as the roof was completely destroyed and a few exterior walls were collapsed. A swath of snapped softwood trees was noted along Abrams Road thus producing EF2 damage.||Once the tornado reached MS Highway 13 and surrounding streets such as Pine Burr Road and Firetower Road near the Marion and Lamar county borders, a slight decline in strength was noted, though its path remained wide. Although, it was still snapping large tree limbs and snapping and uprooting some softwood trees, several of which fell onto wooden power poles and caused them to fall. The tornado maintained its east northeastward track, knocking thousands of trees down along with numerous power lines and poles down across the western portions of Lamar County. This tree damage was consistent with high end EF1 winds peaking between 100-110 mph. Around a dozen homes were damaged starting from Luther Saucier Rd to Purvis to Columbia Road, including one old mobile home that was completely destroyed. As the tornado continued to track east northeastward to the north of Purvis. It crossed Purvis Oloh Road, MS Highway 589 along with US 11. Hundreds of trees were damaged along with many power lines down. Some minor damage occurred to some homes. The tornado was slightly weaker here with winds between 90- 100mph. The tornado crossed I-59 into Forrest County along Ford and Elks Lodge Road in the Dixie community. Hundreds of trees were damaged along with many power lines down. Sheds and several homes had minor damage and one mobile home had the roof blown off. The tornado then crossed US 49 a couple miles north of Southgate Road. The tornado proceeded into Camp Shelby. At Camp Shelby, there were widespread snapped and uprooted trees. Multiple structures across the north half, in and around Lee Avenue to Glenn Walker Lake, had varying degrees of minor to moderate roof damage from the tornado or fallen trees. The park and camper area on the north end of the lake was impacted. One person was injured here as a large tree fell on a truck. The tornado then crossed over US 98 just west of the Perry County line. It continued into Perry County along the Leaf River bottom, snapping and uprooting trees. It continued to track just south of Old River Road before dissipating along Old River Road three miles northwest of New Augusta.

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This violent, deadly tornado traveled 68 miles through parts of five counties including southeastern Jefferson Davis, central Covington, northwestern Jones, southeastern Jasper, and western Clarke counties. Locations impacted by this tornado include Bassfield, the areas between Collins and Seminary, Soso, Moss, Heidelberg, and Pachuta. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF4 with an estimated peak wind of 190 MPH east of Bassfield in southwestern Jefferson Davis County. Additional EF4 damage was noted near Soso in Jones County and at Moss in Jasper County. The maximum path width was 2.25 miles in the vicinity of Hughes Road west of Seminary in western Covington County. At this width, the tornado ranks 3rd widest in the official NOAA United States tornado database behind the El Reno, OK tornado of 2013 (2.6 mi) and the Hallam, NE tornado of 2004 (2.5 mi). This tornado now ranks as the widest on record in the state of Mississippi, surpassing the Yazoo City, MS tornado of 2010 (1.75 mi). Eight lives were lost in this tornado, and there was an undetermined number of additional injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado began south of Bassfield along Bassfield Cemetery Road, uprooting trees and resulting in relatively minor structural damage. As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.|| ||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.|| ||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.|| ||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of the tornado was 190mph, while the maximum wind speed in Covington County was 170mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.90M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This strong tornado traveled over 84 miles through parts of six counties including southern Lawrence, central Jefferson Davis, northern Covington, far northwestern Jones, far southeastern Smith, and Jasper counties. Some of the communities impacted include Oak Vale, the area north of Carson, the north side of Collins, Hot Coffee, Summerland, Stringer, and the west side of Paulding. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF3 with an estimated peak wind of 150 MPH near MS Highway 35 northeast of Carson in Jefferson Davis County. The maximum path width was 1.16 miles also near MS Highway 35 in Jefferson Davis County. No fatalities were reported in this tornado, but there was an undetermined number of injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado initially touched down in southeastern Lawrence County 11 miles south of the city of Monticello, causing minor tree damage. The tornado quickly strengthened as it took a northeast track, producing EF1 and EF2 tree damage along Givens Road and Divide Road. From an elevated location on Divide Road, surveyors were able to view extensive tree damage and ground scouring in the inaccessible Pearl River bottom in Lawrence County. This damage was also confirmed by satellite imagery. The tornado destroyed the roof of a home and completely destroyed a metal building structure on Rayborn Lane. The homeowner also stated that a well built log cabin that he owned along the Pearl River was completely destroyed. After crossing the Pearl River, the tornado proceeded to impact areas just east of the river, causing more significant tree damage along River Road and Coon Hunting Road. The tornado completely destroyed several chicken houses and significantly damaged two homes near MS Highway 43 before crossing into Jefferson Davis County. Once in Jefferson Davis County, the tornado snapped and uprooted numerous trees along Johnson Road, Palestine Road, and Lily Rose Road. The tornado crossed MS Highway 13 snapping a couple of wooden power poles and causing damage to large sections of the roof of a one- story home. Two mobile homes were destroyed along Greens Creek Road, with additional roof damage to homes as well as snapping and uprooting trees as the tornado progressed northeastward. A mobile home was destroyed along Newman Camp Road.|| ||The intensity of the tornado briefly increased to low end EF3 damage as it moved across Kirkley Lane, where extensive tree damage was noted. Damage to roofs, and the snapping and uprooting of trees continued as the tornado moved northeast. Large sections of a roof were removed from a one-story home on Haynes Gray Road, most walls of an apparently abandoned home were collapsed on SJ Garner Road, and the roof of a well built home was removed along Ross McPhail Road. Along Berry Loop, a mobile home was demolished and several other homes were heavily damaged.|| ||As the tornado neared MS Highway 35 and the Terrell community, it grew wider and stronger. Extensive tree damage and varying degrees of damage occurred to dozens of structures. In this area, multiple mobile homes were completely destroyed on both sides of the highway. A large church made of cinderblocks was leveled here and supportive of EF3 wind speeds near 150 mph. Multiple power lines were downed as well. The tornado reached its widest point in this location at 1.16 miles. EF3 tree damage continued as it crossed East Granby Road near the river as well as a small section when it crossed Three Notch Road. Several mobile homes were destroyed here as well. The tornado weakened a bit after this point, but remained strong as it crossed US 84 and neared US 49. A wide swath of extensive tree damage and downed power lines occurred along the path. A set of chicken houses west of Campbell Faler Road was destroyed, and a mobile home was rolled. As the tornado crossed Old Macintosh and Sunset Roads, more trees were downed along with some damage to structures. After crossing US 49, this strong tornado continued northeast where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted and a mobile home was destroyed on Hambone Road.|| ||The tornado continued across northeastern Covington County, crossing MS Highway 532 west of Hot Coffee, causing widespread tree damage and minor roof damage to some residential areas before crossing out of the county. The tornado then moved into northwest Jones and southern Smith County and crossed through the community of Summerland. Widespread tree damage continued through here, with some minor roof damage to residences, which was consistent with high end EF1 damage. A church along Smith County Road 8A had a steeple removed by the winds. The tornado then moved into southwestern Jasper County into the Stringer community. High end EF1 damage occurred in the area, with numerous trees snapped and uprooted in addition to a snapped power pole east of the community. Even though the circulation began to weaken, the tornado continued northeast and produced high end EF1 damage throughout central Jasper County before moving across the western side of Paulding. The tornado weakened in this area, still producing widespread EF0-EF1 tree damage as it crossed MS Highway 503 north of Paulding. The tornado lifted shortly thereafter along County Road 31. The maximum wind speed was 150mph in Jefferson Davis County, but was 140mph in Covington County. The total path length was 83.22 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8.30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history.

Locations impacted by this tornado include Bassfield, the areas between Collins and Seminary, Soso, Moss, Heidelberg, and Pachuta. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF4 with an estimated peak wind of 190 MPH east of Bassfield in southwestern Jefferson Davis County. Additional EF4 damage was noted near Soso in Jones County and at Moss in Jasper County. The maximum path width was 2.25 miles in the vicinity of Hughes Road west of Seminary in western Covington County. At this width, the tornado ranks 3rd widest in the official NOAA United States tornado database behind the El Reno, OK tornado of 2013 (2.6 mi) and the Hallam, NE tornado of 2004 (2.5 mi). This tornado now ranks as the widest on record in the state of Mississippi, surpassing the Yazoo City, MS tornado of 2010 (1.75 mi). Eight lives were lost in this tornado, and there was an undetermined number of additional injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado began south of Bassfield along Bassfield Cemetery Road, uprooting trees and resulting in relatively minor structural damage. As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.|| ||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.|| ||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.|| ||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of both the tornado and in Jefferson Davis County was 190mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 18.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This violent, deadly tornado traveled 68 miles through parts of five counties including southeastern Jefferson Davis, central Covington, northwestern Jones, southeastern Jasper, and western Clarke counties. Locations impacted by this tornado include Bassfield, the areas between Collins and Seminary, Soso, Moss, Heidelberg, and Pachuta. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF4 with an estimated peak wind of 190 MPH east of Bassfield in southwestern Jefferson Davis County. Additional EF4 damage was noted near Soso in Jones County and at Moss in Jasper County. The maximum path width was 2.25 miles in the vicinity of Hughes Road west of Seminary in western Covington County. At this width, the tornado ranks 3rd widest in the official NOAA United States tornado database behind the El Reno, OK tornado of 2013 (2.6 mi) and the Hallam, NE tornado of 2004 (2.5 mi). This tornado now ranks as the widest on record in the state of Mississippi, surpassing the Yazoo City, MS tornado of 2010 (1.75 mi). Eight lives were lost in this tornado, and there was an undetermined number of additional injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado began south of Bassfield along Bassfield Cemetery Road, uprooting trees and resulting in relatively minor structural damage. As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.|| ||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.|| ||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.|| ||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of both the tornado and in Jefferson Davis County was 190mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 18.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of the tornado was 190mph, while the maximum wind speed in Jasper County was 178mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.80M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This strong tornado traveled over 84 miles through parts of six counties including southern Lawrence, central Jefferson Davis, northern Covington, far northwestern Jones, far southeastern Smith, and Jasper counties. Some of the communities impacted include Oak Vale, the area north of Carson, the north side of Collins, Hot Coffee, Summerland, Stringer, and the west side of Paulding. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF3 with an estimated peak wind of 150 MPH near MS Highway 35 northeast of Carson in Jefferson Davis County. The maximum path width was 1.16 miles also near MS Highway 35 in Jefferson Davis County. No fatalities were reported in this tornado, but there was an undetermined number of injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado initially touched down in southeastern Lawrence County 11 miles south of the city of Monticello, causing minor tree damage. The tornado quickly strengthened as it took a northeast track, producing EF1 and EF2 tree damage along Givens Road and Divide Road. From an elevated location on Divide Road, surveyors were able to view extensive tree damage and ground scouring in the inaccessible Pearl River bottom in Lawrence County. This damage was also confirmed by satellite imagery. The tornado destroyed the roof of a home and completely destroyed a metal building structure on Rayborn Lane. The homeowner also stated that a well built log cabin that he owned along the Pearl River was completely destroyed. After crossing the Pearl River, the tornado proceeded to impact areas just east of the river, causing more significant tree damage along River Road and Coon Hunting Road. The tornado completely destroyed several chicken houses and significantly damaged two homes near MS Highway 43 before crossing into Jefferson Davis County. Once in Jefferson Davis County, the tornado snapped and uprooted numerous trees along Johnson Road, Palestine Road, and Lily Rose Road. The tornado crossed MS Highway 13 snapping a couple of wooden power poles and causing damage to large sections of the roof of a one- story home. Two mobile homes were destroyed along Greens Creek Road, with additional roof damage to homes as well as snapping and uprooting trees as the tornado progressed northeastward. A mobile home was destroyed along Newman Camp Road.|| ||The intensity of the tornado briefly increased to low end EF3 damage as it moved across Kirkley Lane, where extensive tree damage was noted. Damage to roofs, and the snapping and uprooting of trees continued as the tornado moved northeast. Large sections of a roof were removed from a one-story home on Haynes Gray Road, most walls of an apparently abandoned home were collapsed on SJ Garner Road, and the roof of a well built home was removed along Ross McPhail Road. Along Berry Loop, a mobile home was demolished and several other homes were heavily damaged.|| ||As the tornado neared MS Highway 35 and the Terrell community, it grew wider and stronger. Extensive tree damage and varying degrees of damage occurred to dozens of structures. In this area, multiple mobile homes were completely destroyed on both sides of the highway. A large church made of cinderblocks was leveled here and supportive of EF3 wind speeds near 150 mph. Multiple power lines were downed as well. The tornado reached its widest point in this location at 1.16 miles. EF3 tree damage continued as it crossed East Granby Road near the river as well as a small section when it crossed Three Notch Road. Several mobile homes were destroyed here as well. The tornado weakened a bit after this point, but remained strong as it crossed US 84 and neared US 49. A wide swath of extensive tree damage and downed power lines occurred along the path. A set of chicken houses west of Campbell Faler Road was destroyed, and a mobile home was rolled. As the tornado crossed Old Macintosh and Sunset Roads, more trees were downed along with some damage to structures. After crossing US 49, this strong tornado continued northeast where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted and a mobile home was destroyed on Hambone Road.|| ||The tornado continued across northeastern Covington County, crossing MS Highway 532 west of Hot Coffee, causing widespread tree damage and minor roof damage to some residential areas before crossing out of the county. The tornado then moved into northwest Jones and southern Smith County and crossed through the community of Summerland. Widespread tree damage continued through here, with some minor roof damage to residences, which was consistent with high end EF1 damage. A church along Smith County Road 8A had a steeple removed by the winds. The tornado then moved into southwestern Jasper County into the Stringer community. High end EF1 damage occurred in the area, with numerous trees snapped and uprooted in addition to a snapped power pole east of the community. Even though the circulation began to weaken, the tornado continued northeast and produced high end EF1 damage throughout central Jasper County before moving across the western side of Paulding. The tornado weakened in this area, still producing widespread EF0-EF1 tree damage as it crossed MS Highway 503 north of Paulding. The tornado lifted shortly thereafter along County Road 31. The maximum wind speed was 150mph in Jefferson Davis County. The total path length was 83.22 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down near Jefferson Rd just east of the intersection with Jack Foil Rd in Walthall County. It quickly strengthened as it moved northeastward through the Hope area where it produced damage consistent with 115 mph winds. It also quickly grew in width and was roughly 1200 yd/0.67 mi wide in Walthall County by the time it approached Hwy 27. As it crossed Hwy 27 it continued to cause significant damage along East Sartinville Rd. The tornado was strongest as it approached James Ratcliff Rd. Two homes on this road were leveled, one being reduced to a slab. Consultation with subject matter experts including both engineers and experts in forensic tornado damage analysis supports raising the maximum intensity to 170 mph based on the house that was reduced to a slab and a large hard wood tree that was uprooted and tossed several feet from where it stood. The increased wind speed makes the tornado an EF-4 on the Enhanced Fujita scale. The other home that was leveled suffered damage consistent with a high end EF-3. While all walls were collapsed, there was no evidence of bolts that would have held the sill plates to the foundation. Thus, the wind speed for this particular damage is reduced slightly from the expected. As it continued to move northeastward, it continued snapping every tree near the center of its path. It also caused substantial damage to several small cinder block buildings, tore the roof off of a home and rolled a tied down single-wide manufactured home as it crossed East Sartinville Rd. From there it continued northeastward and tore the entire roof from a brick home just before moving into Lawrence County. It should be noted that from just southwest of James Ratcliff Rd through the remainder of the Walthall Co portion of the track, nearly every tree in the path of the tornado was snapped or uprooted.|| ||The tornado then moved into far southeast Lawrence County, where it began snapping large hardwood branches on JK Givens Road. The tornado started to strengthen as a large swath of broken and uprooted hardwood trees were noted farther along JK Givens Road. As the tornado moved east northeast to Tynes Ainsworth Road, it tossed and completely destroyed a mobile home, causing two fatalities. Concurrently, it also snapped numerous softwood and hardwood trees behind and around the mobile home. The snapping and uprooting of numerous softwood trees continued when it moved northeast across Felix Sartin Road, while also causing some shingles to be removed from a one-story residence. Swaths of snapped hardwood trees and the uproot of trees was noted at Holmes Road, where a few wooden power poles were also snapped. The tornado then trekked into northwest Marion County, causing the snapping of multiple softwood trees just north of Ranch Road. The tornado moved northeast to US Road 587 where it broke a few wooden power poles and continued snapping softwood trees. It continued along its east-northeast path impacting River Road and Cooper Road, and causing large softwood branches to snap and the snapping and uprooting of softwood trees. The uprooting of a few softwood trees was noted when the tornado reached Highway 13, though the amount of uprooted trees was not as impressive from earlier in its track, thus showing a declining in strength. The tornado moved northeast into Jefferson Davis County, resulting in the snapping of a few small softwood tree limbs at Raynes Road. The tornado lifted at Joe Dyess Road, but not before snapping a few small hardwood tree limbs.||The total path length of the tornado was 21.17 miles. Maximum width was 1.1 miles in Lawrence County. Maximum estimated wind speed for the tornado was 170mph, and rated an EF4. However the maximum estimated wind speed in Lawrence County was 140mph, which was rated an EF3.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 750.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Locations impacted by this tornado include Bassfield, the areas between Collins and Seminary, Soso, Moss, Heidelberg, and Pachuta. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF4 with an estimated peak wind of 190 MPH east of Bassfield in southwestern Jefferson Davis County. Additional EF4 damage was noted near Soso in Jones County and at Moss in Jasper County. The maximum path width was 2.25 miles in the vicinity of Hughes Road west of Seminary in western Covington County. At this width, the tornado ranks 3rd widest in the official NOAA United States tornado database behind the El Reno, OK tornado of 2013 (2.6 mi) and the Hallam, NE tornado of 2004 (2.5 mi). This tornado now ranks as the widest on record in the state of Mississippi, surpassing the Yazoo City, MS tornado of 2010 (1.75 mi). Eight lives were lost in this tornado, and there was an undetermined number of additional injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|||The tornado began south of Bassfield along Bassfield Cemetery Road, uprooting trees and resulting in relatively minor structural damage. As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of the tornado was 190mph, while the maximum wind speed in Clarke County was 104mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This violent, deadly tornado traveled 68 miles through parts of five counties including southeastern Jefferson Davis, central Covington, northwestern Jones, southeastern Jasper, and western Clarke counties. Locations impacted by this tornado include Bassfield, the areas between Collins and Seminary, Soso, Moss, Heidelberg, and Pachuta. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF4 with an estimated peak wind of 190 MPH east of Bassfield in southwestern Jefferson Davis County. Additional EF4 damage was noted near Soso in Jones County and at Moss in Jasper County. The maximum path width was 2.25 miles in the vicinity of Hughes Road west of Seminary in western Covington County. At this width, the tornado ranks 3rd widest in the official NOAA United States tornado database behind the El Reno, OK tornado of 2013 (2.6 mi) and the Hallam, NE tornado of 2004 (2.5 mi). This tornado now ranks as the widest on record in the state of Mississippi, surpassing the Yazoo City, MS tornado of 2010 (1.75 mi). Eight lives were lost in this tornado, and there was an undetermined number of additional injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|||The tornado began south of Bassfield along Bassfield Cemetery Road, uprooting trees and resulting in relatively minor structural damage. As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of the tornado was 190mph, while the maximum wind speed in Clarke County was 104mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.|| ||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of the tornado was 190mph, while the maximum wind speed in Jones County was 167mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 11.80M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The environment ahead of the QLCS was unusually unstable for this time of day and year, with gulf moisture spreading upper 60 F to near 70 F dewpoints into a warm sector across the Southeast United States and mid level lapse rates around 7 C/km helping produce mixed layer convective available potential energy (MLCAPE) as high as 2000 J/kg across Southeast South Carolina. Within the warm sector, very strong vertical shear associated with a 50 knot plus low and mid-level jet, effective bulk shear around 70 knots, effective storm relative helicity in the 400-600 m2/s2 range, and VAD wind profiles displaying large, curved low-level hodographs were supportive of well organized convection and potentially embedded supercell thunderstorms in a QLCS capable of producing a prolonged path of damaging winds and strong long-track tornadoes. As the QLCS swept through Southeast South Carolina, a few supercell thunderstorms became exceptionally strong while partially breaking away from the main line of thunderstorms, producing widespread wind damage and strong long-track tornadoes. ||A total of 13 confirmed tornadoes occurred across Southeast South Carolina, including a long track EF-4 tornado in Hampton County that took the lives of 5 people and injured 60 others along an approximately 24 mile path. The EF-4 tornado was the first to have occurred across Southeast South Carolina and the last to have occurred in the entire state of South Carolina since November 17, 1995, almost 25 years prior. This particular tornado was associated with a storm that produced a destructive path of straight-line wind damage and series of long track and intermittent tornadoes for over 150 miles, beginning in Screven County, Georgia, then continuing northeast across Hampton County, Colleton County, Dorchester County, and Berkeley County, South Carolina before leaving the area and eventually shifting offshore along the South Carolina coast. Two other storms were responsible for the remaining tornadoes across the area, most of which occurred from a single storm occurring across Edisto Island, Seabrook Island and Kiawah Island. Outside the EF-4 tornado in Hampton County, straight-line winds near a passing tornado claimed the life of one individual and injured one in Colleton County, while another tornado caused 6 injuries across Berkeley County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service Storm Survey Team confirmed an EF-4 tornado with an estimated maximum wind speed of 175 mph in central Hampton County. ||The tornado began just north of Collie Road, approximately 3 miles west-northwest of Scotia, South Carolina, snapping and uprooting trees and causing damage to the Federal Correctional Institution of Estill along its northeast track. The tornado then continued northeast, crossing over Highway 321 near the intersection with County Road S-25-35 before gaining strength and causing substantial damage. Beyond this point, the unusually long track and wide tornado damaged and destroyed many residences, including mobile and single family homes along its entire path. A few automobiles were also tossed/rolled 50 to 75 yards from their original locations. In addition, the tornado reached a maximum width of about 0.75 mile, causing extensive damage to thousands of trees and numerous power lines. At times, the damage pattern suggested that the tornado may have consisted of multiple vortices, which can occur in stronger tornadoes.||The most significant structural damage occurred just south of Estill, South Carolina and across Nixville, South Carolina, where at least six residences were destroyed. After crossing Highway 321 and continuing a northeast track, the tornado began producing EF-2 to EF-3 damage to residences along Sprayfield Road to Lena Expressway. The tornado then continued northeast where it completely destroyed a mobile home near the intersection of Highway 3 and Highway 601, tragically claiming the lives of 2 adult males. Continuing on a northeast track, the tornado heavily damaged homes near the intersection of Turner Expressway and Brandy Lane, including completely destroying a mobile home that tragically claimed the lives of 2 adult females and 1 adult male. The tornado then reached peak EF-4 intensity along Lento Road where the roof and all exterior/interior walls of a two story home were removed and dispersed across the yard. The tornado then began a weakening trend while tracking further northeast, eventually crossing Highway 278, Yemassee Highway and ending approximately 1 mile beyond the intersection of Old Salkehatchie Highway and Archie Road before the Hampton/Colleton County line. ||Overall, the tornado path stretched approximately 24 miles, claiming the lives of 5 individuals in the hardest hit areas just south of Estill, South Carolina and across Nixville, South Carolina. Additionally, 60 people sustained injuries associated with the tornado tracking through this hardest hit area, including a few individuals that were thrown 30 to 50 yards from mobile homes and individuals that were in homes that received EF-3 to EF-4 damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At times, the damage pattern suggested that the tornado may have consisted of multiple vortices, which can occur in stronger tornadoes.||The most significant structural damage occurred just south of Estill, South Carolina and across Nixville, South Carolina, where at least six residences were destroyed. After crossing Highway 321 and continuing a northeast track, the tornado began producing EF-2 to EF-3 damage to residences along Sprayfield Road to Lena Expressway. The tornado then continued northeast where it completely destroyed a mobile home near the intersection of Highway 3 and Highway 601, tragically claiming the lives of 2 adult males. Continuing on a northeast track, the tornado heavily damaged homes near the intersection of Turner Expressway and Brandy Lane, including completely destroying a mobile home that tragically claimed the lives of 2 adult females and 1 adult male. The tornado then reached peak EF-4 intensity along Lento Road where the roof and all exterior/interior walls of a two story home were removed and dispersed across the yard. The tornado then began a weakening trend while tracking further northeast, eventually crossing Highway 278, Yemassee Highway and ending approximately 1 mile beyond the intersection of Old Salkehatchie Highway and Archie Road before the Hampton/Colleton County line. ||Overall, the tornado path stretched approximately 24 miles, claiming the lives of 5 individuals in the hardest hit areas just south of Estill, South Carolina and across Nixville, South Carolina. Additionally, 60 people sustained injuries associated with the tornado tracking through this hardest hit area, including a few individuals that were thrown 30 to 50 yards from mobile homes and individuals that were in homes that received EF-3 to EF-4 damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The environment ahead of the QLCS was unusually unstable for this time of day and year, with gulf moisture spreading upper 60 F to near 70 F dewpoints into a warm sector across the Southeast United States and mid level lapse rates around 7 C/km helping produce mixed layer convective available potential energy (MLCAPE) as high as 2000 J/kg across Southeast South Carolina. Within the warm sector, very strong vertical shear associated with a 50 knot plus low and mid-level jet, effective bulk shear around 70 knots, effective storm relative helicity in the 400-600 m2/s2 range, and VAD wind profiles displaying large, curved low-level hodographs were supportive of well organized convection and potentially embedded supercell thunderstorms in a QLCS capable of producing a prolonged path of damaging winds and strong long-track tornadoes. As the QLCS swept through Southeast South Carolina, a few supercell thunderstorms became exceptionally strong while partially breaking away from the main line of thunderstorms, producing widespread wind damage and strong long-track tornadoes. ||A total of 13 confirmed tornadoes occurred across Southeast South Carolina, including a long track EF-4 tornado in Hampton County that took the lives of 5 people and injured 60 others along an approximately 24 mile path. The EF-4 tornado was the first to have occurred across Southeast South Carolina and the last to have occurred in the entire state of South Carolina since November 17, 1995, almost 25 years prior. This particular tornado was associated with a storm that produced a destructive path of straight-line wind damage and series of long track and intermittent tornadoes for over 150 miles, beginning in Screven County, Georgia, then continuing northeast across Hampton County, Colleton County, Dorchester County, and Berkeley County, South Carolina before leaving the area and eventually shifting offshore along the South Carolina coast. Two other storms were responsible for the remaining tornadoes across the area, most of which occurred from a single storm occurring across Edisto Island, Seabrook Island and Kiawah Island. Outside the EF-4 tornado in Hampton County, straight-line winds near a passing tornado claimed the life of one individual and injured one in Colleton County, while another tornado caused 6 injuries across Berkeley County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The National Weather Service Storm Survey Team confirmed an EF-3 tornado with an estimated maximum wind speed of 145 mph just east of Moncks Corner, South Carolina. The tornado began in the Fairlawn Subdivision, just east of Moncks Corner. Several homes had significant damage along Old Fort Road and Dennis Boulevard. There was a home at the east end of Dennis Boulevard that had significant damage to justify the EF-3 tornado rating. There was also extensive snapping and uprooting of trees, as well as vehicle and trailer damage in the area. The tornado moved east-southeast, generally down Dennis Boulevard, then east across the west branch of the Cooper River, before turning east-northeast across South Carolina 402 and Cane Gully Road. At this location, a mobile home was completely destroyed and several other homes and structures sustained significant damage. The tornado then continued east-northeast snapping and uprooting trees, with significant damage to at least one home off of Myrtle Lane, and minor roof and siding damage to approximately four additional homes just south of Bullhead Road.

A strong southerly return flow commenced out ahead of the trough during the 8th-9th, allowing for unseasonably warm and humid conditions to advance northward across Southern Oklahoma, much of Central and Eastern Texas, as well as Louisiana, Arkansas, and the Lower Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, an intensifying surface low pressure system and associated dry line developed along the Red River of North Texas into Southern Oklahoma during the afternoon hours, which spread east northeast across the Ark-La-Tex during the early morning hours on January 11th. With afternoon temperatures climbing into the mid 70s ahead of this trough, moderate instability developed across the broad warm sector, with very strong wind shear in place as large scale forcing increased ahead of the trough axis across East Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, and North Louisiana. Thus, an axis of strong to severe showers and thunderstorms developed during the evening hours across Southeast Oklahoma, adjacent sections of Southwest Arkansas and East Texas, which advanced east into North Louisiana during the early morning hours of the 11th. Damaging winds downed trees and power lines across portions of East Texas, with even multiple tornadoes touching down along the line of severe thunderstorms. Unfortunately, a man  was killed when a tornado touched down west of Nacogdoches and a tree fell on his mobile home. These storms also produced locally heavy rainfall, with amounts of one to three inches, with isolated higher amounts up to four inches recorded across much of this area, resulting in isolated instances of flash flooding. These storms continued to intensify during the late evening and early morning hours as they moved into extreme Eastern Texas and Western Louisiana, producing more in the way of widespread wind damage and isolated tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF-1 tornado with estimated maximum winds near 100 mph touched down along County Road 723 just south of Farm to Market Road 225, where it snapped several large branches in a field of trees. The tornado tracked east-northeast where it crossed Farm to Market Road 225 and paralleled the north side of the roadway. It snapped and uprooted numerous trees and broke several more large branches as it continued east-northeast. The tornado downed a large tree onto a mobile home along Sweat Circle, a private road off of Farm to Market Road 225, where a 44 year old male was killed and one minor injury was reported. The tornado then crossed County Road 722 and Russelville Road where it resulted in additional tree damage and minor damage to homes. The tornado continued northeast where it crossed County Road 719 and several private properties, damaging a few more trees before lifting near Floyd Harvin Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 75.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It quickly strengthened as it moved northeastward through the Hope area where it produced damage consistent with 115 mph winds. It also quickly grew in width and was roughly 1200 yd/0.67 mi wide by the time it approached Hwy 27. As it crossed Hwy 27 it continued to cause significant damage along East Sartinville Rd. The tornado was strongest as it approached James Ratcliff Rd. Two homes on this road were leveled, one being reduced to a slab. Consultation with subject matter experts including both engineers and experts in forensic tornado damage  analysis supports raising the maximum intensity to 170 mph based  on the house that was reduced to a slab and a large hard wood tree that was uprooted and tossed several feet from where it stood. The increased wind speed makes the tornado an EF-4 on the Enhanced Fujita scale. The other home that was leveled suffered damage consistent with a high end EF-3. While all walls were collapsed, there was no evidence of bolts that would have held the sill plates to the foundation. Thus, the wind speed for this particular damage is reduced slightly from the expected. The tornado was also widest in this area, reaching a maximum width of around 1300 yards or approximately 0.75 miles. As it continued to move northeastward, it continued snapping every tree near the center of its path. It also caused substantial damage to several small cinder block buildings, tore the roof off of a home and rolled a tied down single-wide manufactured home as it crossed East Sartinville Rd. From there it continued northeastward and tore the entire roof from a brick home just before moving into Lawrence County. It should be noted that from just southwest of James Ratcliff Rd through the remainder of the Walthall Co portion of  the track, nearly every tree in the path of the tornado was snapped or uprooted. The tornado was responsible for two fatalities in Walthall County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The rainfall amounts, combined with extremely wet soils resulted in isolated flash flooding over portions of north and central Georgia. Widespread rainfall amounts were generally 1 to 3 inches, with the heaviest amounts oriented along a line from LaGrange, to Covington, to Lexington. A few strong to severe thunderstorms also produced isolated reports of damaging winds and a couple of isolated, brief tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Media reported that Rocker Road near Greensboro Highway was washed out by flash flooding. A driver was injured and had to be rescued when her car drove into the floodwaters. Additionally, several other roads were closed in the area due to water over the road or touching the bridge, including: Happy Hollow Road, Norman Road NE, Maxwell Mill Road. Radar estimates indicate that 3 to 5 inches of rain occurred over the area in a short period of time, causing a rapid rise in creeks and streams and overwhelming culvert and storm drain systems.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The storms over Deep East Texas and the southern sections of North Central Louisiana near the front which were rooted closer to the surface became severe, producing more in the way of damaging winds and large hail, with storms farther north across Northwest Louisiana more elevated, producing more sporadic wind damage and large hail.

During the onset of the heavier rainfall, a few storms caused wind damage near Tainter Lake and Colfax, but most of the damage was minor with a few large tree limbs and power lines blown down. ||Deep moisture convergence along the axis of thunderstorms, training along the periphery of the the numerous boundaries, combined with PWAT values of 1.7 to 1.9 inches which is over the 99th percentile value, caused extreme rainfall rates. ||Before the flash flooding event developed, there was an hour or two during Sunday evening that dropped locally one to two inches of rainfall in the areas that received more torrential rainfall in the early morning hours. ||There was one main band of excessive rainfall that occurred in west central Wisconsin during the early morning. This area was from Prescott, northeast toward River Falls and Baldwin. Based on the return period from precipitation amounts in a specific time frame, the values were a 100-200 year event. Flash flood guidance values were 1.5 to 2 times above normal.  ||As the runoff continued through the morning, the flash flood event become more areal flooding as the flood waters receded into creeks, streams, and eventually the mainstem rivers. Other areas that experienced flooding but not as significant include the New Richland Golf Course. The St. Croix County Sheriff Office documented the flood damage the next day from their drone. From the video, you could see numerous culverts and roads that were washed away including crop fields (near the creeks and streams) that were inundated nearly 24 hours after the initial rainfall started. ||Some of the higher rainfall totals around the area are as follows.||Emerald measured 9.84 inches.|Baldwin measured 8.72 inches. |River Falls measured 6.34 to 7.82 inches around the city. |Roberts measured 7.24 inches. |Menomonie measured 5.08 to 5.64 inches around the city.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Parts of St. Croix County received over 8 to 9 inches of rain causing flooding and washed out roads across the county. The worst areas that experienced significant flooding were the Kinnickinnic, Rush and Eau Galle Recreation River areas, and the towns of Hammond, Baldwin, Emerald, Glenwood City, and Cylon. ||Some of the specific roads that were closed or washed out during the height of the flooding were: 1000 Block of 190th Street in Baldwin, 2100 110th Avenue in Baldwin, Country Road TK, DD & 240th Street in Baldwin, Highway 12 & 220th Street in Baldwin Township, 2254 130th Avenue in Emerald, 2900 Block of 200th Avenue in Glenwood City, and West Blvd & Highway 65 in Roberts.||Unfortunately,  A man died after he lost control while driving on a water-covered road north of Baldwin near County Road E and Highway 63. At least five other motorists standing on the roofs of their cars were rescued from rushing water in that same location in the Baldwin area.||About $4 Million dollars in damages was due to 40 homes that sustained major damage and one that was destroyed when the foundation caved in. The other $4 Million dollars was due to bridge, highway and road damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A group of people camping at the foot of Alder Creek on the north shore of Apache Lake attempted to flee the area by boat as the flash flood approached. The flash flood with debris caused an inoperable boat carrying five adults to capsize. Three out of the five adults were rescued out of the water by another boat.
