The widespread effect and destruction wrought by these storms were unprecedented in Idaho; so was the tornadic outbreak as the line spawned five tornados.  The line took on a classic bow echo appearance as it charged east at 50 mph.  A mesonet established throughout the valley recorded an awesome straight line wind of 60 to 95 mph.  A new all time record for highest wind gust in Idaho was recorded at Minidoka at 96.3 mph!  This surpassed the previous wind gust record of 90 mph that occured at Moscow Pullman Airport on 2/8/90.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Bingham county sustained by far the most damage from both the straight line wind and the tornadoes.  Wind along I-15 near Blackfoot flipped 3 tractor trailers (1 injury) and forced a Greyhound bus (1 injury) into the median.  Poles for electric lines were downed wholesale.  Loss of power would idle 700 workers from potato processing plants and 350 workers from a flour mill for the remainder of the week.  In Moreland and in Shelley, both the elementary and high schools suffered roof damage.  A trailer home was destroyed and two more tipped over.  Scores of homes suffered minor roof damage.  Dozens of sheds and outbuildings were destroyed or damaged along with an airport hanger.  Innumerable trees, some over 60 years old, were toppled.  Damage to center pivot and wheel line irrigation systems will easily top $1 million dollars alone.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Minor damage occurred just west of Huntsville Park with damage at Joe Davis Stadium and a shopping area known as Stadium Place. Several businesses sustained significant damage including an NTB store where the wind collapsed an exterior wall and threw roofing materials across Memorial Parkway.  A number of other businesses in the immediate area sustained damage, too.  Two people were apparently slightly injured as they sought shelter when the wind struck while eating at one of the restaurants that was damaged.  After crossing Memorial Parkway, the downburst worked its way eastward blowing down numerous trees and power lines.  The wind damage extended up the west side of a ridge running north from Garth Mountain.  Significant damage ends near the top of the ridge.  Most homes that were damaged had roof damage that consisted mainly of shingles being removed.  One tree fell on a car and severely damaged it.  One man was killed as he was walking across the Tennessee River Bridge in Madison County and fell off.  County authorities were unsure whether it was directly related to the high wind or he jumped.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The storms began in western Massachusetts during the late afternoon, with numerous reports of downed trees, wires, and large hail in Hampshire and Hampden Counties.  Hail as large as golf balls was reported in Granby.Northampton received the brunt of the storm damage, where a brief tornado and microburst caused extensive damage and one injury.  The tornado, rated F1 on the Fujita Scale with winds of 73 to 112 mph, touched down very briefly at 5 pm EDT in the higher elevations in Leeds, in the northwest section of Northampton.  A few minutes later, the same tornado briefly touched down again near Bridge Road in the Pine Brook Farm portion of Northampton.  The initial touchdown was only 15 yards wide at its maximum, about one half mile long, and lasted only one minute.  It began near Kennedy Road, just to the west of the southern portion of Roberts Meadow Reservoir.  It ended on the east side of the reservoir at Reservoir Road.  Convergent tree damage was noted in these areas.  The majority of the damage from this severe thunderstorm occurred from a very powerful microburst, with estimated winds between 90 and 105 mph, which affected the section of Northampton around Pine Brook Curve, Emily Lane, and Hatfield Street.  Straight line wind damage was observed in this area, with large trees snapped in the middle, and in some cases at their bases.  Four homes were declared uninhabitable due to large trees which had fell upon them.  Hundreds of trees were downed as well as power lines.  Hail, ranging in size from quarter to golf ball, accompanied this storm.  Amazingly, only one minor injury occurred.  A man was struck by a tree which fell into his kitchen, but was spared by his refrigerator, which acted as a shield according to several accounts.In central and eastern Massachusetts, thunderstorm winds downed trees, branches, and power lines throughout many communities in Worcester, Middlesex, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Plymouth Counties.  Dime to nickel size hail also accompanied the storms.  At Logan International Airport in Boston, a wind gust to 62 mph was reported.About 15,000 electric customers lost power during the storms as they moved through Massachusetts.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms developed along and ahead of the front.  A number of these became severe, producing marginally severe hail.  The largest hail report was half-dollar sized in Clarkston.The storms produced a healthy amount of lightning.  A strike in Saline caused fire damage to a home there.  At Detroit Metro Airport, lightning struck the steel superstructure of a new terminal under construction.  Nine workers were injured when the bolt struck, and two required an overnight  hospital stay.At the tail end of the episode, a stray thunderstorm wind gust downed a large tree at Braeburn Golf Course in Salem.  The tree fell on a golfer, and he died of his injuries while being transported to the University of Michigan Hospital.The storms also produced quite a bit of rainfall.  The highest rainfall amount, 4 inches, was recorded in the city of Monroe.  Small creeks and streams, and urban areas, saw some flooding develop in the afternoon.  Flood waters lingered into the next morning, with some rutting of rural roads, and flooding of yards along the smaller creeks.  Minor river flooding also resulted over the next few days (see below).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms developed in the warm, humid air out ahead of the cold front.  A number of these became severe, producing the worst severe thunderstorm outbreak in metro Detroit in almost two years.  The thunderstorms took two forms on this day.  Widely scattered supercells developed across southeast Michigan, south of Interstate 69.  These rotating thunderstorms produced numerous funnel clouds, but no confirmed tornadoes.  However, some of these storms produced very large hail.  Hailstones as large as oranges were reported in Ypsilanti.  The Detroit Tiger baseball game at Comerica Park was interrupted by golfball sized hail.  The game was eventually rained/hailed out.  Golfball sized hail was also reported in Tecumseh and Plymouth.  Some sporadic wind damage also occurred with these storms, downing trees and power lines.  However, the stronger winds were to come later.A line of thunderstorms developed in northern Illinois and Indiana, and moved northeast at almost 70 mph.  This line of storms overtook the supercells as it moved into southeast Michigan, and produced widespread wind damage.  Some of the most significant damage follows:In Lenawee County: A barn was destroyed in Hudson.  Several vehicles were damaged by fallen trees in Morenci and Adrian.   Blissfield experienced some of the worst damage: a mobile home was flipped, injuring the two occupants (one of whom had broken ribs and a punctured lung); another man suffered electrical injuries when a falling power line struck him; an RV was overturned; store signs were destroyed; a garage collapsed; several homes were damaged by fallen trees, including one landmark home heavily damaged; at a local ball field, a scoreboard was destroyed, a dugout deroofed, and metal bleachers tossed; and large steel grain bins were destroyed.  A hangar at nearby Betz Airport collapsed, crushing an airplane.  Two other hangars were damaged.  In Sand Lake, a hay barn and a corral were blown down.  Tecumseh was also hard hit: a storage structure at a lumber yard was destroyed; part of an inn was deroofed; and numerous homes and vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.Dozens of trees were downed in Monroe County.  A spotter measured a 75 mph gust in Maybee, where a glass patio table was tossed from a porch to the back yard (without breaking!).  A trailer was blown over at a Dundee construction site, where a large tree damaged a car, home, and shed when it fell.  In Petersburg, a falling tree crushed an historic (over 150 year old) railroad depot.Wind damage was also widespread in Washtenaw County.  In Milan, a garage was blown down, and eight vehicles were struck by falling trees.  A grocery store in Ann Arbor had its front doors blown off.  Ypsilanti was hardest hit: several hundred trees were downed, damaging a home,  slicing a camper van in half, and crushing a garage and a car; a fire station was partially deroofed; and a church steeple was destroyed.In Wayne County: The west and southwest sides of the city of Detroit saw damage, with windows shattered, roofs peeled up, and chimneys knocked over.  At the intersection of Tireman and Rangoon, a car was flipped, injuring the two occupants; a nearby factory was deroofed, with a 13 year old boy injured by flying debris.  At Detroit Metro Airport, a 55 mph gust was measured; a Mesaba Airlines hangar was destroyed, and a plane inside was damaged.  Power poles were broken in Flat Rock.  In New Boston, store fronts were damaged, with many trees uprooted.  At Mettetal Airport near Plymouth, a plane was flipped.  Scores of trees were downed in Westland, damaging a truck and a home, and breaking windows.  In Redford, a falling tree destroyed a swimming pool and damaged a garage.  Woodhaven saw a garage destroyed and a second displaced; a warehouse roof was damaged; a home was deroofed; street signs were downed; and a wood board was embedded in the side of a house.  A school in Livonia had its air conditioning units blown over, and the walls of a connecting corridor were displaced.  Two homes in Dearborn were condemned after tree damage; another home was shifted off its foundation; a garage was destroyed; and a building was deroofed, with roofing debris damaging two nearby cars.  An outbuilding was demolished by falling trees in Sumpter Township.Oakland County was the other county that saw widespread damage.  A 64 mph wind gust occurred in White Lake.  Winds to 70 mph deroofed a trailer home in Highland.  In Milford, falling trees crushed a car and damaged a home.  Farmington saw a garage damaged by a tree, and phone poles were snapped.  In Novi, a trailer at a construction site was destroyed, with another trailer and a wall under construction sustaining damage; the air conditioning units on the roof of a business were ripped off.  Power poles were snapped in Auburn Hills.  Dozens of trees were downed in Pontiac, destroying a garage and damaging several homes.  In Bloomfield Township, a trampoline was destroyed, and a home was damaged by a falling tree.  Waterford saw an animal shelter destroyed, another damaged; over 150 trees were damaged; and a picnic pavilion was also damaged.Damage in the other counties was much less widespread, and was generally limited to tree limbs and power lines going down.  All told, over 200,000 people lost power at some point, and thousands of insurance claims were filed over the coming weeks.  Many schools were closed the next day due to damage or power outages; some schools and businesses did not reopen for several days.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 755K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Phillips and Rooks counties took the brunt of this mid-evening storm as losses in these two counties alone totaled in the millions.  The Long Island area of northern Phillips county sustained the most damage.  Winds of 100 mph hammered the area around 7 pm and hail covered the ground like snow.  Over 300 windows in this small town were broken and nearly every home in the town sustained some damage to windows, siding or the roof.  One person was injured as she and her family tried to run for cover from the storm.  The wind blew her across the kitchen of her home and into the dining room.  She sustained head, neck and leg injuries and was transferred to a hospital in Kearney, Nebraska.  The local grain company had seven grain bins and two unloading facilities demolished.  About 1200 customers lost power during the storm.  Wind gusts to 80 mph and hail the size of quarters were also reported in Agra and Logan.As the storm moved south into Rooks county, it spawned a brief tornado north of Webster Lake.  The funnel set down about 1 mile north of the reservoir but did little if any damage.  Just days earlier, outdoor warning devices were installed at the lake area and they were put into use to alert the public on this day.  Eighty mile an hour winds were common in Rooks county and resulted in up-rooted trees, downed power lines,  roof and building damage.  One truck was overturned on Highway 24 but the driver was uninjured.Crop damage was limited to the remaining wheat crop and some corn.  Fortunately, about 80 percent of the wheat crop had been harvested prior to the storm.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A complex of thunderstorms moved east across northern Michigan in the early morning hours.  Outflow from this thunderstorm complex moved south into southeast Michigan as a miniature cold front, and thunderstorms redeveloped along the leading edge of this outflow in the afternoon.  Meanwhile, thunderstorms also developed in northeast Indiana, along the edge of a deck of low clouds.  These separate areas of thunderstorms would merge over Metro Detroit in the late afternoon and early evening, producing tremendous amounts of rain.  Many places had seen heavy rain the day before, and thus the area was quite vulnerable to flooding.At Detroit Metro Airport, 3.71 inches of rain fell on the 11th.  This was the wettest September day ever in Detroit, and the 5th wettest day of all time.  This was on top of the 1.65 inches that fell the day before.  National Weather Service radar estimated around 5 inches of rain fell on the 11th in a swath from Brownstown Township to Allen Park in Wayne County.  In Washtenaw County, 2.26 inches of rain fell in Ann Arbor, after 1.32 inches the previous day.The storms had a broad impact.  Over 30,000 households were affected by power outages.  About one hundred flights out of Detroit Metro Airport were cancelled, and numerous people were stranded at the airport overnight due to the multitude of flooded roads in the area.  A collision on Interstate 94 in Harrison Township (Macomb County) during a downpour closed the highway for two hours.  Sewage overflows were common in Wayne County, as the water treatment system was quickly overwhelmed; the failure of some pumping operations due to power outages contributed to the sewer backup.  Several lawsuits were filed in connection with damage caused by raw sewage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tree was downed onto a car on Russell Avenue near Summit Street.

The first report of damage was a barn flattened at Pingree Grove. Five cars in the barn were damaged. There were downed trees and power lines in the area as well.  A spotter in Carpentersville measured a 73 mph wind gust. Doors were blown in at a business in Elgin. Trees were down in Elgin and Sleepy Hollow. The storm did considerable damage along the Lake-Cook County line - in Arlington Heights, Palatine, Buffalo Grove, Deerfield, Highland Park, Wheeling, and Northbrook. Thousands of large tree limbs and trees were downed smashing cars and homes. Some of the trees were 80 to 100 years old. A newspaper report said there were 1000 trees down in Highland Park alone. In Deerfield the hose tower roof was blown off the fire station. The police communications tower was bent in half at Highland Park. Over 100,000 customers were without power. Windows were blown out at the Allstate Insurance building in Northbrook. A wind gust to 84 mph was measured at the Palwaukee Airport in Wheeling (PWK) at 1542 CST.  The canopy at the Edens (I-94) toll plaza was damaged. State Police reported several cars had windows broken on the tollway near Lake-Cook Road. Also on the tollway, a pick-up truck with a 5th wheel trailer was overturned in Deerfield . On I-294, a van was overturned by winds and trees were uprooted near Willow Road.  A 69 year old man was killed when a tree fell on his car in Wilmette.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the 35 mile long line of thunderstorms moved southeast through Dane, northern Green, and Rock Counties, it increased in strength, ultimately producing straight-line winds estimated up to 100 knots (115 mph), heavy rains at a rate of 1 to 3 inches per hour, and hail stones 1 inch in diameter.  Due to downed power lines and poles, ultimately about 18,000 customers had electrical power disrupted for 1 to 2 days.  Descriptions of weather-related events follow in a county-by-county breakdown.Dane County:Powerful thunderstorm winds, estimated at 56 knots (65 mph), toppled several large trees in and near the city of Belleville. There were no reports of injuries or deaths. Minor urban-type flooding was noted due to intense rain accompanying the storm.Green County:The squall-line intensified as it clipped the northeast quarter of Green County. Based on inflicted damage, winds gusts were estimated to be 74 knots (85 mph).  The worst-hit area extended from a subdivision west of the village of Dayton (Town of Exeter), east/southeast to the county line.  About 50 homes sustained varying amounts of damage caused by felled trees, tree branches, or the wind outright. Damage to home siding and roofs was also noted.  Hundreds of trees were toppled, about 2 dozen farm buildings were damaged or destroyed, several silos were damaged, and two semi-tractor trailers were overturned.  Many power lines were either blown over or knocked down by tree debris.Rock County:This county bore the brunt of the storm as its straight-line winds intensified to an estimated 100 knots (115 mph). The macroburst damage path was 3 to 6 miles wide, extending from southwest of Evansville in the Town of Magnolia (Highway 59 and A) east/southeast through the city of Janesville to southeast of Avalon near Caver Roehl Park.  A newspaper headline nicely stated the effects:  Rain! Wind! Wow!  The powerful winds leveled thousands of trees (some 200 years old); tore roofs off homes; businesses, and farm buildings; blew tops of silos off, flipped over vehicles; blew in windows; damaged or peeled off home siding; knocked over billboards and road signs; closed many roads due to debris, and flattened corn and soybean fields.  Based on newspaper photographs and eyewitness accounts, maximum wind gusts were estimated to be in the 87 to 100 knots range (100 -115 mph).  The worst of the damage appeared to be equivalent to that caused by tornado winds of about 115 mph, or at the bottom of the F2 category.  Many people noted that the sky grew very dark as the storm blew in with a wall of white rain mixed with tree leaves and branches. The city of Janesville was at ground zero, as a 3.7 square mile looked like a bomb had hit its downtown area and the near east and west sides.  A roof was torn off one business, and bricks were pealed off another business.  It took at least 2 weeks to remove the tree debris from city streets, sidewalks, and backyards.  Dozens of vehicles were damaged by felled trees and branches.  It is estimated that 400 to 500 city homes sustained some degree of damage (6 destroyed).  Traxler and Bond Parks looked like disaster areas and were closed.  About 50 electrical poles were snapped by tree debris or the winds.  One person in the city was injured when a tree fell on their pickup truck.  Just north of Janesville on Interstate-90, another person was injured when their SUV was flipped over by the winds. In addition, 5 semi-tractor trailers were overturned on I-90 in the same vicinity. A new sub-division 3 miles south of Janesville experienced extensive roof or siding damage due to the winds or tree debris.  Several vehicles were damaged as well. Just to the south of the city, the wastewater treatment plant recorded 1.48 inches of rain as the storms moved through, resulting in urban flooding. There were other unofficial reports of 2 to 3 inches in the city area.The civil Town of Magnolia, in the western part of the county, was also hard hit by the macroburst, especially near and along Highway 59 and County Trunk Highway A.  About 40 power poles in this Town were toppled by the winds or tree debris.A little further north on Croft Road, just southwest of Evansville, a local resident noted this sequence of events: the initial, powerful winds and blinding rains lasted for about 5 minutes and were followed by hailstones up to 1 inch in diameter. Then the rain and hail stopped.  After a couple minutes he noticed across the road in a field a ground-based vortex pulling corn stalks up to about 200 feet above the ground, while above it at cloud base was a funnel cloud.  This weak vortex then hit a barn and caused slight damage before dissipating.  Shortly thereafter, another round of rain, and gusty, but much weaker winds occurred.  Based on this resident's account, and their prior experiences with tornadoes while living in Texas, this vortex was classified as a tornado. The macroburst continued to inflict wind damage to a point about 3 miles east/southeast of the Janesville city limits along Highway 14, at which point it weakened.  However, the thunderstorms briefly intensified once again southeast of the village of Avalon near Carver Roehl Park.  At this location, a barn's roof was lifted and dropped by powerful winds, resulting in a collapsed structure which trapped 40 steer.  Fifteen of the steer died from injuries, and some of the hay bales were destroyed.  Collectively across Rock County, about 4500 acres of corn and soybean crops were badly damaged or destroyed. Thirty-five farm buildings had minor damage, 8 had major damage, and 19 were destroyed by the winds. Walworth County:The remains of the squall-line generated downburst winds which leveled large trees in and near the city of East Troy.Racine County:The remains of the squall-line generated downburst winds which leveled large trees west of Waterford.Kenosha County:The remains of the squall-line generated downburst winds which leveled large trees southwest of the village of Twin Lakes.Milwaukee County:The remains of the thunderstorms dumped rain amounts of 2.25 to 3.1 inches across Milwaukee County based on Ham reports.  Moderate urban flooding resulted.  A West Allis motorist was rescued from their stalled vehicle due to water depths of 1.5 to 3 feet in low spots on roads.  Similar water depths on strees were noted elsewhere in the county, especially in the southern half.  No damage was reported. Synoptically, an upper level trough was moving across Wisconsin on August 5th, with a weak vorticity maxima over the southern part of the state moving east/southeast. The south winds of a low-level jet fed the storms as west-northwest flow at 18,000 feet intensified to 60 knots based on profiler data.  Thunderstorm echo tops were 40 to 42,000 feet.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms developed in the warm, humid air out ahead of the cold front.  A number of these became severe, producing the worst severe thunderstorm outbreak in metro Detroit in almost two years.  The thunderstorms took two forms on this day.  Widely scattered supercells developed across southeast Michigan, south of Interstate 69.  These rotating thunderstorms produced numerous funnel clouds, but no confirmed tornadoes.  However, some of these storms produced very large hail.  Hailstones as large as oranges were reported in Ypsilanti.  The Detroit Tiger baseball game at Comerica Park was interrupted by golfball sized hail.  The game was eventually rained/hailed out.  Golfball sized hail was also reported in Tecumseh and Plymouth.  Some sporadic wind damage also occurred with these storms, downing trees and power lines.  However, the stronger winds were to come later.A line of thunderstorms developed in northern Illinois and Indiana, and moved northeast at almost 70 mph.  This line of storms overtook the supercells as it moved into southeast Michigan, and produced widespread wind damage.  Some of the most significant damage follows:In Lenawee County: A barn was destroyed in Hudson.  Several vehicles were damaged by fallen trees in Morenci and Adrian.   Blissfield experienced some of the worst damage: a mobile home was flipped, injuring the two occupants (one of whom had broken ribs and a punctured lung); another man suffered electrical injuries when a falling power line struck him; an RV was overturned; store signs were destroyed; a garage collapsed; several homes were damaged by fallen trees, including one landmark home heavily damaged; at a local ball field, a scoreboard was destroyed, a dugout deroofed, and metal bleachers tossed; and large steel grain bins were destroyed.  A hangar at nearby Betz Airport collapsed, crushing an airplane.  Two other hangars were damaged.  In Sand Lake, a hay barn and a corral were blown down.  Tecumseh was also hard hit: a storage structure at a lumber yard was destroyed; part of an inn was deroofed; and numerous homes and vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.Dozens of trees were downed in Monroe County.  A spotter measured a 75 mph gust in Maybee, where a glass patio table was tossed from a porch to the back yard (without breaking!).  A trailer was blown over at a Dundee construction site, where a large tree damaged a car, home, and shed when it fell.  In Petersburg, a falling tree crushed an historic (over 150 year old) railroad depot.Wind damage was also widespread in Washtenaw County.  In Milan, a garage was blown down, and eight vehicles were struck by falling trees.  A grocery store in Ann Arbor had its front doors blown off.  Ypsilanti was hardest hit: several hundred trees were downed, damaging a home,  slicing a camper van in half, and crushing a garage and a car; a fire station was partially deroofed; and a church steeple was destroyed.In Wayne County: The west and southwest sides of the city of Detroit saw damage, with windows shattered, roofs peeled up, and chimneys knocked over.  At the intersection of Tireman and Rangoon, a car was flipped, injuring the two occupants; a nearby factory was deroofed, with a 13 year old boy injured by flying debris.  At Detroit Metro Airport, a 55 mph gust was measured; a Mesaba Airlines hangar was destroyed, and a plane inside was damaged.  Power poles were broken in Flat Rock.  In New Boston, store fronts were damaged, with many trees uprooted.  At Mettetal Airport near Plymouth, a plane was flipped.  Scores of trees were downed in Westland, damaging a truck and a home, and breaking windows.  In Redford, a falling tree destroyed a swimming pool and damaged a garage.  Woodhaven saw a garage destroyed and a second displaced; a warehouse roof was damaged; a home was deroofed; street signs were downed; and a wood board was embedded in the side of a house.  A school in Livonia had its air conditioning units blown over, and the walls of a connecting corridor were displaced.  Two homes in Dearborn were condemned after tree damage; another home was shifted off its foundation; a garage was destroyed; and a building was deroofed, with roofing debris damaging two nearby cars.  An outbuilding was demolished by falling trees in Sumpter Township.Oakland County was the other county that saw widespread damage.  A 64 mph wind gust occurred in White Lake.  Winds to 70 mph deroofed a trailer home in Highland.  In Milford, falling trees crushed a car and damaged a home.  Farmington saw a garage damaged by a tree, and phone poles were snapped.  In Novi, a trailer at a construction site was destroyed, with another trailer and a wall under construction sustaining damage; the air conditioning units on the roof of a business were ripped off.  Power poles were snapped in Auburn Hills.  Dozens of trees were downed in Pontiac, destroying a garage and damaging several homes.  In Bloomfield Township, a trampoline was destroyed, and a home was damaged by a falling tree.  Waterford saw an animal shelter destroyed, another damaged; over 150 trees were damaged; and a picnic pavilion was also damaged.Damage in the other counties was much less widespread, and was generally limited to tree limbs and power lines going down.  All told, over 200,000 people lost power at some point, and thousands of insurance claims were filed over the coming weeks.  Many schools were closed the next day due to damage or power outages; some schools and businesses did not reopen for several days.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 960K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Wind gusts were estimated to reach 80 mph in the strongest part of the storm that went through Lawrence Township. About 75 large trees were completely uprooted. Three persons were injured. The worst damage within Lawrence Township occurred on U.S. Route 206, Province Line, Carter, Rosedale and Carson Roads. Carter Road was closed for over 24 hours because of the downed trees and five snapped poles. A large tree crashed into the bedroom of a house on U.S. Route 206 next to Peterson's Nursery. A 92-year-old barely escaped serious injury. In the nursery itself, 30 trees were uprooted and a gazebo was lifted and splintered. Two volunteer fire-fighters were injured by a fallen limb while responding to an emergency call. Elsewhere within the township, a chimney was knocked down on Lawrenceville Road, another tree landed on a house on Tall Timbers Drive and the front door and garage of another home were completely blocked by downed trees.  The Bristol-Myers Squibb Lawrence Campus suffered considerable wind damage to their trees, especially the willows. At least three vehicle were crushed by fallen trees.  In Princeton Township, U.S. Route 206 was blocked by fallen trees for a day. Several trees were also knocked down in Clarksville (West Windsor Township). Large hail also fell in Lawrence and Princeton Townships and shredded vegetation. The hail reached golf ball size in Princeton Township. In Lawrence Township, the hail piled into small drifts.

The difference in pressure between these systems caused increasing south winds.  As an intensifying cold front trailing from the low approached the area with abundant low level moisture in place, widespread rain with embedded thunderstorms occurred.  Heavy rain caused significant flooding at several locations.  Heavy showers, some associated with severe thunderstorms, produced wind damage at several locations.Here are selected wind damage reports and measured peak wind gusts:In Passaic County, high winds downed trees that fell on a car which injured 2 occupants in Clifton.In Bergen County, trees were downed in Ramsey.  The peak wind gust measured by the Automated Surface Observing System at Teterboro Airport was 41 mph at 10:27 am.In Essex County, numerous trees were downed in West Caldwell, Caldwell, Essex Fells, Maplewood and Nutley.  The peak wind gust measured by the Automated Surface Observing System at Newark Airport was 51 mph at 10:50 pm.In Hudson County, trees were downed in Kearney and two sections of Harrison.  The peak wind gust measured by spotter equipment at Harrison was 47 mph at 11:00 am.In Union County, trees were downed in Plainfield, Hillside, and Union.  Telephone poles were also downed across part of Route 22 in Union.  The peak wind gust measured by spotter equipment at Elizabeth was 53 mph.The heaviest rain occurred in bands oriented from southwest to northeast ahead of the approaching cold front.  The axis of the heaviest rain extended from Western Union County northeast across Western Essex, Central Passaic, and Western Bergen Counties, where 2 to 3 inches of rain fell with isolated amounts up to 3 1/2 inches.  Flooding of low-lying poor drainage areas and streams occurred.Here are selected rainfall amounts and flood damage reports:In Passaic County, rainfall amounts ranged from 2.20 inches at West Patterson to 3.11 inches at Charlottesburg.In Bergen County, rainfall amounts ranged from 1.32 inches at New Milford to 2.91 inches at Franklin Lakes.  Flooding was reported in Oakland and the Saddle River in Lodi was near bankfull at 11:29 am.In Essex County, rainfall amounts ranged from 1.38 inches at Maplewood to 2.60 inches at Essex Fells.  Flooding occurred along parts of the JFK Parkway in Millburn.  The Peckman River at Verona crest stage was 4.60 feet at 1:00 pm, which was 1.1 feet above its' flood stage of 3.5 feet.In Union County, rainfall amounts ranged from 2.10 inches at Cranford to 2.48 inches at Mountainside.  Urban flooding of low-lying poor drainage areas was reported in Elizabeth and Union.  The Rahway River at Springfield was above its' flood stage of 5.5 feet from 12:15 pm through 5:30 pm.

Thunderstorm winds blew down trees and power lines in Frankfort, Herkimer county. More trees were blown down at Fort Plain, Canajoharie and St. Johnsville, all in Montgomery county. Trees and wires were knocked down at Caroga Lake in Fulton county. Trees fell in Charlottesville, Schoharie county. In Schenectady county, trees were reported blown over in both Duanesburg and the city of Schenectady. Numerous trees fell in Rensselaerville and areas  just  to  the north, in Albany county. By far, the most concentrated and severe damage took place at Ballston Spa in Saratoga county. A strong microburst, with winds estimated between 75 and 100  miles-an-hour, covered a swath 75 yards wide and 500 yards long. The microburst went through the Curtis Lumber facility. Winds destroyed a portion of the barn structure, scattering heavy lumber across the yard and removing roofing. The wind drove a piece of the roof  through the cab of a parked truck cab, impaling the truck driver's left leg, and critically injuring him. He had to be removed from the vehicle by the Jaws of Life. Another passenger in the cab sustained superfiical injuries. Another nearby truck also sustained damage. An executive at Curtis Lumber reported spotting a funnel cloud, which was likely a minor vortex, spun up by downburst action. The official National Weather Service survey found no evidence of tornadic damage. The damage was in a large fan pattern consistant with an intense microburst. More trees fell in nearby in Ballston Spa and Galway. 	Another microburst hit the Town of  Jackson, in Washington County, knocking over an estimated 1000 trees. Also in Washington county, trees were blown down at Fort Edward.  	There was one significant hail report with the storms. Nickel size hail was reported at Warrensburg in Warren County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Massive downburst winds estimated at 90 to 110 mph hit areas from eight miles west of Spearfish to several miles east of Spearfish. Hail to golfball size accompanied the high winds and damaged roofs and siding throughout the region, although the winds caused the worst damage. In town, the intense winds shattered signs, blew over gas station awnings and the wind driven hail caused major damage to automotive and mobile home dealerships.  A retirement home had a quarter of its roof torn off and a hotel had to evacuate all its guests as a portion of their roof was blown off. At least ten mobile homes were unlivable, and over 100 mobile homes had damage to siding, roofing and skirting. The airport at Spearfish had 27 planes damaged, and seven of those were destroyed beyond repair.  Seven hangers at the airport were also damaged or destroyed. A massive amount of trees in Spearfish were either snapped in half or completely knocked over, leaving many roads unpassable after the event.  Roofing material sliced through an oxygen valve at the Spearfish Trout Farm and killed 100,000 out of 120,000 trout that the family raised.  In the Spearfish city campground, more then 150 campers were there, in anticipation of the 60th Annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally the following week.  Over 100 trees were blown over and many people had camping equipment, vehicles or motorcycles damaged by the falling trees. None of the trees fell on  occupied tents, although several fell within inches of where people were sleeping in their tents. 4 injuries were reported.  One of the injuries required treatment at Rapid City Medical Center after someone was injured when his camper flipped over on the interstate. East of Spearfish, highway signs were blown over, large round bales of hay were blown several yards, and more trees were blown down or snapped off.  Numerous outbuildings were also damaged, with debris scattered nearly a hundred yards downstream.  In Sturgis, the damage was not as intense.  The majority of the damage occurred to tents that were set up by vendors selling merchandise for the motorcycle rally. The most critical injury from the entire event occurred in Sturgis when a vendor was trying to keep his tent from being blown away, and he was thrown into metal scaffolding.  He was treated at the Rapid City Regional Hospital.  As the storm moved to the southeast, high winds over 60 mph were reported for nearly 45 minuted between Sturgis and Rapid City.  In Rapid City, the National Weather Service office measured wind gusts of 70 mph.  The only damage reported were tree limbs down. The storm weakened as it moved southeast of Rapid City, but was still at severe limits as it passed over the Badlands National Park and went southward into Bennett County.  Observers in Martin reported 60 mph wind gusts. The storm dissipated before reaching Nebraska.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 9.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

They produced one F1 tornado, one funnel cloud, and high winds that downed many trees and power lines and caused at least 11 injuries, 8 of which were in New York City.Based on a storm survey performed by NWS staff, an F1 tornado occurred around 7:05 pm EDT in the continental village region of the town of Cortlandt, about 3 miles north of Peekskill on the Westchester and Putnam Counties border.  The tornado was classified as an F1 based on tree damage and their associated patterns.  Touch down was on the southwest corner of the intersection of Highland Drive and Heath Terrace.  The tornado moved northeast along the southeast shore of Cortlandt Lake in a counter-clockwise arched pattern lifting just south of the intersection of Schuyler Lane and Putnam Road.  The Path Length was about 0.3 miles and Path Width averaged 33 yards.  In the vicinity of Tyron Circle and Putnam Road, the tornado was at its' widest and strongest.  Damage occurred to about 20 houses, with 7 houses incurring moderate damage.  The tornado apparently reformed in 2 other locations as the severe thunderstorm moved east:  Sprout Brook Road (Path Length about 0.15 miles) and Lakeview Road (Path Length just less than 0.1 miles).  Numerous trees of 1 1/2 to 2 feet in diameter were snapped, mainly about 20 to 25 feet above the ground.  Three telephone poles were snapped in the middle.  Meteorologically, this tornado formed on the roll of a gust front that moved nearly 50 mph across the region and was likely on the ground for less than 1 minute.Here's a brief summary of damage reports received:In Orange County, a 60 mph wind gust was reported at the Plattekill Service Area along the NYS Thruway, just north of Leptondale.  There were numerous reports of wires down, trees down on houses and cars and trees blocking roads in the vicinity of Wawayanda, Middletown, Cornwall, Goshen, Chester, and Newburgh.In Rockland County, a tree fell on and damaged a house on Mountain Avenue in Hillburn.  Trees were also downed in New City.  A large tree fell on a car in Haverstraw.In Putnam County, several trees and power lines were downed in Carmel and Brewster.In Westchester County, numerous trees were downed at Croton On Hudson, numerous trees and power lines were downed at Ossining, a tree fell on a house at Yonkers, and trees were downed in Valhalla.In Bronx County, numerous trees were downed countywide.In Kings County, one person was injured when a large store sign fell on top of people.

The tornado crossed I-265 , moving eastnortheast reaching Arthur Avenue, 10th Ave. and 9th Ave. North, crossed the Cumberland River  and then reaching Dickerson Pike and Ellington Parkway, finally dissipating around Petway Avenue and Gallatin Road.One woman was injured when an interstate sign blew into her car and caused her  to wreck.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The city of Milwaukee recorded it's earliest tornado ever (just before sunset), and an extremely large number of reports of large hail from 3/4 to 1.75 inches in diameter were relayed to the NWS Sullivan office.  Most of the thunderstorms developed gusty winds on the order of 30 to 50 mph, but one managed to generate a gust of 58 knots (67 mph) at the TV-4 station on the north side of Milwaukee.  The thunderstorm which dumped large hail 7 N of Portage also had winds that uprooted some trees and blew a car off of Inerstate 39.  An earlier thunderstorm that affected the west side of the city of Portage left the ground white with golf-ball size hail that also shattered several  vehicle windshields.  The thunderstorm that affected Wisconsin Dells also left the ground white with hail. The Milwaukee tornado spun up about 1/2 mile east/northeast of the terminal building of General Mitchell International Airport, just east of Runway 19, moved northeast and crossed East Layton Avenue just east of South Pennsylvania Avenue in Cudahy, continued northeast through St. Francis, and dissipated over the northwest corner of Nathanael Greene Park.  Apparently the tornado wasn't strong enough to cause any damage on the airport grounds, but it did cause considerable damage in Cudahy and St. Francis.  Fifty-three (53) residental homes sustained minor damage and eleven (11) had major damage. Eight (8) businesses sustained major damage.  Many motor vehicles were over-turned, several roofs were partially peeled off of homes, power lines and trees were toppled, and gas leaks were reported. Sixteen (16) people were injured enough to require medical treatment (lacerations), but there were no fatilities.  Most of the people who were injured were in their vehicles.  Based on this damage, it is estimated that maximum wind speeds of this tornado were 105 to 110 mph. The airport terminal building and control tower went on emergency power after commercial power was disrupted.  Airport control tower officials were able to divert airplane traffic, consequently there were no aircraft mishaps.  Preceding the tornado, there were reports of large hail and some tree damage in the forward flank downdraft of the parent thunderstorm over St. Francis and the southern part of the city of Milwaukee.  The tornado was extensively photographed and captured on video tape.  It briefly displayed multiple-vortex characterisitics.  The last time a tornado was documented in Milwaukee County was in May, 1989.NWS Sullivan meteorologists speculate that an outflow boundary was pushed northwest to the airport area from a thunderstorm that earlier moved through the southeast corner of Milwaukee County. This outflow boundary may have focused low-level vorticity that helped generate the tornado.  The parent thunderstorm possessed a mesocyclone.  Synoptically, a deep low pressure was moving northeast through central Iowa toward northern Wisconsin.  This movement put southern Wisconsin in a "dry slot" associated with strong jet stream winds aloft.  The combination of surface dewpoints in the lower to mid 50s, strong speed shear between surface winds out of the south and southwest mid-level winds, sufficient instability due to daytime heating/temperatures in the 70s, and cold air aloft allowed thunderstorms to grow to 40,000 feet. Several thunderstorms had supercell characturistics, but only one was assoicated with a tornado, and another with a funnel cloud. Thunderstorm movement was northeast at 50 to 60 mph (about 47 to 51 knots).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Narrative can be found below in summary of March 8, 2000.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.57M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The city of Milwaukee recorded it's earliest tornado ever (just before sunset), and an extremely large number of reports of large hail from 3/4 to 1.75 inches in diameter were relayed to the NWS Sullivan office.  Most of the thunderstorms developed gusty winds on the order of 30 to 50 mph, but one managed to generate a gust of 58 knots (67 mph) at the TV-4 station on the north side of Milwaukee.  The thunderstorm which dumped large hail 7 N of Portage also had winds that uprooted some trees and blew a car off of Inerstate 39.  An earlier thunderstorm that affected the west side of the city of Portage left the ground white with golf-ball size hail that also shattered several  vehicle windshields.  The thunderstorm that affected Wisconsin Dells also left the ground white with hail. The Milwaukee tornado spun up about 1/2 mile east/northeast of the terminal building of General Mitchell International Airport, just east of Runway 19, moved northeast and crossed East Layton Avenue just east of South Pennsylvania Avenue in Cudahy, continued northeast through St. Francis, and dissipated over the northwest corner of Nathanael Greene Park.  Apparently the tornado wasn't strong enough to cause any damage on the airport grounds, but it did cause considerable damage in Cudahy and St. Francis.  Fifty-three (53) residental homes sustained minor damage and eleven (11) had major damage. Eight (8) businesses sustained major damage.  Many motor vehicles were over-turned, several roofs were partially peeled off of homes, power lines and trees were toppled, and gas leaks were reported. Sixteen (16) people were injured enough to require medical treatment (lacerations), but there were no fatilities.  Most of the people who were injured were in their vehicles.  Based on this damage, it is estimated that maximum wind speeds of this tornado were 105 to 110 mph. The airport terminal building and control tower went on emergency power after commercial power was disrupted.  Airport control tower officials were able to divert airplane traffic, consequently there were no aircraft mishaps.  Preceding the tornado, there were reports of large hail and some tree damage in the forward flank downdraft of the parent thunderstorm over St. Francis and the southern part of the city of Milwaukee.  The tornado was extensively photographed and captured on video tape.  It briefly displayed multiple-vortex characterisitics.  The last time a tornado was documented in Milwaukee County was in May, 1989.NWS Sullivan meteorologists speculate that an outflow boundary was pushed northwest to the airport area from a thunderstorm that earlier moved through the southeast corner of Milwaukee County. This outflow boundary may have focused low-level vorticity that helped generate the tornado.  The parent thunderstorm possessed a mesocyclone.  Synoptically, a deep low pressure was moving northeast through central Iowa toward northern Wisconsin.  This movement put southern Wisconsin in a "dry slot" associated with strong jet stream winds aloft.  The combination of surface dewpoints in the lower to mid 50s, strong speed shear between surface winds out of the south and southwest mid-level winds, sufficient instability due to daytime heating/temperatures in the 70s, and cold air aloft allowed thunderstorms to grow to 40,000 feet. Several thunderstorms had supercell characturistics, but only one was assoicated with a tornado, and another with a funnel cloud. Thunderstorm movement was northeast at 50 to 60 mph (about 47 to 51 knots).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Narrative can be found below in summary of March 8, 2000.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.57M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado weakened as it entered downtown, but wind borne debris broke thousands of windows in buildings and high rises (626 PM). Particularly hard hit was the Bank One Building, which had 80% (3,000) of its windows broken, and the Union Pacific Resources Building (1,300 of 5,000 windows broken). Numerous other structures were affected to a lesser degree. Automobiles in streets and parking lots were also damaged. The tornado then dissipated as it moved east of downtown, although scattered minor damage occurred to roofs, trees, fences, and billboards about 3 miles east of the city near I-30 and Brentwood Stair. 	Two people were killed as a direct result of the tornado. A man (age 52) was killed while trying to reach shelter after warning others of the tornado, while a homeless man (age 67) was killed by a wall that collapsed on him. Some 80 other people were injured, but only six required hospitalization. Hail did extensive damage to roofs and autos mainly in Lake Worth and Saginaw. 	Initial tornado damage in Arlington occurred at a restaurant on South Cooper street. The tornado moved east and gained strength, doing F3 damage near Bardin and Matlock (707 PM), south of I-20.

Limbs broken off  and picked up by the winds resulted in one broken window and one minor injury.  One apartment occupant, who was on her balcony at the time, was hit in the shoulder by an airborne limb. There was about $35,000 damage to the building and fence.

During the day, very strong warm air advection took place.  Temperatures warmed rapidly  during the day with highs reaching the mid to upper 90s over about the southwest half of the state.  Dew point temperatures were in the upper 60s to low 70s.  This combination produced CAPE values in excess of 8000 J/kg.  During the afternoon, a strong cap was in place with 700 mb temperatures around +16 C.  This prevented convection from firing during the afternoon.  Toward evening, thunderstorms broke through the cap over northeast Iowa.  The storms went from initial echo to tornadic storms in less than 50 minutes.  A supercell formed west of the Waterloo area.  This cell became a splitting cell and produced a brief tornado in Grundy County as the right moving cell split off, and golf ball size hail in Bremer County from the left moving cell.  The cell moved off quickly, however additional supercells back developed over the same area.  the strongest tornado developed in the Cedar Falls area and tracked across the northern portions of Waterloo.  This cell produced a strong tornado which was actually a multi-vortex tornado based on reports from storm chasers in the area.  At one point, west of Dunkerton, three tornadoes each one quarter mile wide were on the ground with this storm.  The tornado damaged several houses and a few farmsteads along the way.  Reports indicated between 5 and 10 houses in Black Hawk County were totally destroyed, and another 15 to 20 sustained significant damage.  A total of at least 41 structures sustained at least some damage.  In addition to the tornado, damage also occurred south of the track as RFD winds estimated as high as 100 MPH were observed.  Dunkerton was hard hit as the tornado moved through.  Heavy damage was reported at a coop elevator in Dunkerton, with 10 of 16 grain elevators damaged.  A roof was removed from a church as well, resulting in about $500,000 damage.  The City Hall building was destroyed in Dunkerton.  The City Hall was housed in a series of double wide trailers since ironically the former City Hall building was destroyed just last year in the floods of '99.  As the tornado moved through the fairly densely populated area, numerous injuries were reported.  Some of the injuries were severe with limbs being cut off by flying debris.  One woman lost both one arm and one hand, and had her back broken.  She passed away 17 days after her injuries occurred.  Six of the injuries occurred at a nursing home that was hit by the tornado.  They occurred as the 139 residents were being evacuated.  Reports indicated the width of the tornado was up to three-quarters of a mile at its widest.  The damage path from the storm was around one and one half miles wide.  The tornado continued moving east and crossed into Buchanan County, about 4 miles northeast of Dunkerton.  A short time later, another cell developed in the Dunkerton area and dropped a tornado.  That tornado struck a farm northwest of town, destroying the farm house and seven outbuildings.  In addition to the damage that occurred to the structures, the family dog and one of the five horses on the farm were killed.  Reports indicate a letter from one of the farm houses destroyed was found 60 miles away from Dunkerton in the town of Monona in Clayton County.  Polly Mill's rural Dunkerton farmhouse was shredded by the tornado.  She lost some of her late husband's military medals, pages out of the family Bible, and part of her collection of letters and first-issue stamps.  Sixty miles away, on a farm east of Monona, the letter was found in an envelope carrying a first-day issue, 5-cent stamp commemorating the Battle of New Orleans.  There was yet a third round of tornadic storms in the Dunkerton area.  The last tornado touched down near Dunkerton and developed southward.  Two houses in the town of Dunkerton were destroyed by this tornado.  In addition to the tornadoes, very heavy rain fell in a narrow area of Black Hawk County.  Reports of 3 inches or more of rain was received from the area.  Soil conditions were very dry at the time.  The dry soil conditions helped preclude any significant flooding.  By the afternoon of the 12th, Iowa Governor Vilsack had declared Black Hawk County a state disaster area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Multi-vortex, regerative tornado<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.75M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Two houses in the town of Dunkerton were destroyed by this tornado.  In addition to the tornadoes, very heavy rain fell in a narrow area of Black Hawk County.  Reports of 3 inches or more of rain was received from the area.  Soil conditions were very dry at the time.  The dry soil conditions helped preclude any significant flooding.  By the afternoon of the 12th, Iowa Governor Vilsack had declared Black Hawk County a state disaster area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Multi-vortex, regerative tornado<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.75M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado began near a church in Eola, where a home lost part of its roof and the steeple blew off the church. A neighboring home lost its porch and had a window blown out, while some old buildings nearby were flattened. Many trees were also blown down. On Highway 29 south of Bunkie, one permanent home lost a portion of its roof, one outside wall, and the carport. Another permanent home bult on a foundation was swept off its foundation and moved 200 feet. In this home, three people received minor injuries. They were found in debris 300 feet from where the home originally lay. The wood frame home they were in was torn to pieces.

The tornado began near a church in Eola, where a home lost part of its roof and the steeple blew off the church. A neighboring home lost its porch and had a window blown out, while some old buildings nearby were flattened. Many trees were also blown down. On Highway 29 south of Bunkie, one permanent home lost a portion of its roof, one outside wall, and the carport. Another permanent home bult on a foundation was swept off its foundation and moved 200 feet. In this home, three people received minor injuries. They were found in debris 300 feet from where the home originally lay. The wood frame home they were in was torn to pieces.

Rapid destabilization ensued later in the morning across eastern Illinois and northern Indiana with CAPES to 3500 j/kg by early afternoon.  VAD wind profiles showed 850 millibar winds in excess of 50 knots in advance of the upper trough by afternoon and as storms developed along the left over outflow boundary across Illinois... they quickly became severe and organized into a large bow echo and moved quickly eastward into northern Indiana causing extensive wind damage.  By late afternoon... a short segmented squall line developed just ahead of this bow echo squall line and extended from a St. Joseph to Fulton county line.  Along the southern end of this line... an embedded tornadic supercell developed and interacted with a left over storm-scale outflow boundary to produce the Wabash/Kosciusko and DeKalb county tornadoes.  The lack of significant low level shear likely prevented a much larger and more widespread tornado event especially across Whitley and Allen counties where several funnel clouds were captured on film but failed to touch down.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down again, hitting a farm at 1300 N and 100 W.  A man suffered a broken leg here.  Two hog sheds and a large grain bin were destroyed.  A 200-yard swath of trees were uprooted to the northeast along the railroad tracks.  Another man suffered back and chest injuries as the tornado continued to the intersection of 1300 N and Meridian Road  and demolished the barn in which he stood.  A 5th wheel camper was rolled 50 yards from its original position destroying it.  The tornado continued to the next farm just south of 1400 N and 100 E.  The barn was destroyed and the house suffered moderate damage, primarily from flying tree debris.  The tornado snapped a utility pole, which fell on an 18-year-old boy, breaking his leg.  Many trees and power lines were downed along the way.  From here, the tornado continued until the Wabash/Kosciusko county line.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 700K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Rapid destabilization ensued later in the morning across eastern Illinois and northern Indiana with CAPES to 3500 j/kg by early afternoon.  VAD wind profiles showed 850 millibar winds in excess of 50 knots in advance of the upper trough by afternoon and as storms developed along the left over outflow boundary across Illinois... they quickly became severe and organized into a large bow echo and moved quickly eastward into northern Indiana causing extensive wind damage.  By late afternoon... a short segmented squall line developed just ahead of this bow echo squall line and extended from a St. Joseph to Fulton county line.  Along the southern end of this line... an embedded tornadic supercell developed and interacted with a left over storm-scale outflow boundary to produce the Wabash/Kosciusko and DeKalb county tornadoes.  The lack of significant low level shear likely prevented a much larger and more widespread tornado event especially across Whitley and Allen counties where several funnel clouds were captured on film but failed to touch down.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down again, hitting a farm at 1300 N and 100 W.  A man suffered a broken leg here.  Two hog sheds and a large grain bin were destroyed.  A 200-yard swath of trees were uprooted to the northeast along the railroad tracks.  Another man suffered back and chest injuries as the tornado continued to the intersection of 1300 N and Meridian Road  and demolished the barn in which he stood.  A 5th wheel camper was rolled 50 yards from its original position destroying it.  The tornado continued to the next farm just south of 1400 N and 100 E.  The barn was destroyed and the house suffered moderate damage, primarily from flying tree debris.  The tornado snapped a utility pole, which fell on an 18-year-old boy, breaking his leg.  Many trees and power lines were downed along the way.  From here, the tornado continued until the Wabash/Kosciusko county line.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 700K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Another home near the Shenandoah River Bridge was destroyed by fire after lightning struck. In Rockingham County, trees were downed in Broadway.  In addition, a lightning strike started a forest fire about 5 miles northwest of Briery Branch.  The blaze charred nearly 100 acres of the George Washington National Forest southwest of Hone Quarry before being brought under control on the 14th.  In Warren County, trees were damaged in Bentonville.  In Shenandoah County, quarter to golfball sized hail fell in New Market.

Traveling in a northeasterly direction the tornado moved from a rural, unpopulated area of the Black Warrior River into an area of homes south of Shelton State Community College. The tornado crossed SR 69 destroying a nearly complete shopping center which included a Winn Dixie store. East of SR 69 the tornado destroyed a number of houses and residential structures. As the tornado reached US 82 it destroyed a number of mobile homes where several deaths were reported. From US 82 the tornado continued northeasterly downing numerous trees and power lines and damaging residential structures. The tornado crossed I-20/59 just west of exit 77 where many trees were uprooted or snapped off. Minor damage occurred to the JVC manufacturing facility. At exit 77 a number of commercial structures including hotels, fast food restaurants, and truck stops sustained damage including a number of vehicles that were overturned. The tornado continued northeasterly for a couple of miles before dissipating rapidly. Ironically, the tornado dissipated as it moved into an open, unpopulated area. The tornado was spawned by a supercell thunderstorm that originated in Mississippi. This thunderstorm was responsible for additional tornado damage in St. Clair and Etowah counties.Tuscaloosa EMA reported 11 fatalities with this tornado along with 144 injuries. Nine of the fatalities occurred in mobile homes, one in a vehicle, and one in a commercial building converted to residential use. Six of those killed were females and five were males. Ages ranged from 16 months to 83 years old.  There were 251 single family dwellings affected (43 destroyed, 76 with major damage, 138 with minor damage), 179 mobile homes affected (79 destroyed,  23 with major damage, 77 with minor damage), and 13 businesses affected (1 destroyed, 7 with major damage, 5 with minor damage).The tornado was on the ground for a total of 18 miles, all within Tuscaloosa County. The tornado path was estimated to be 750 yards wide at it's maximum intensity. This tornado was rated an F4 on the Fujita Scale for tornado intensity. Tornado intensity varied along the path with considerable F2 and F3 damage in the area from just west of SR 69 to US 82 in the Hinton Place and Hillcrest Meadows areas as well as the Bear Creek area. It was also in these areas where pockets of F4 destruction occurred. The tornado first touched down at 12:54 PM and dissipated at 1:12 PM with a forward speed of approximately 60 MPH.

Additional roof and tree damage occurred in Monticello neighborhood of River Oaks. A number of businesses were then damaged or destroyed near the intersection of Camp Bowie and West Seventh (620 PM). Tornado moved east along West Seventh Street, striking the Montgomery Ward building and the adjacent Linwood neighborhood, doing extensive damage to older homes (622 PM). The tornado then did extensive damage to the six story Cash America building, nearly destroying it. Further significant damage was then done to the Mallick Tower building and Calvary Cathedral Building (624 PM). The tornado weakened as it entered downtown, but wind borne debris broke thousands of windows in buildings and high rises (626 PM). Particularly hard hit was the Bank One Building, which had 80% (3,000) of its windows broken, and the Union Pacific Resources Building (1,300 of 5,000 windows broken). Numerous other structures were affected to a lesser degree. Automobiles in streets and parking lots were also damaged. The tornado then dissipated as it moved east of downtown, although scattered minor damage occurred to roofs, trees, fences, and billboards about 3 miles east of the city near I-30 and Brentwood Stair. 	Two people were killed as a direct result of the tornado. A man (age 52) was killed while trying to reach shelter after warning others of the tornado, while a homeless man (age 67) was killed by a wall that collapsed on him. Some 80 other people were injured, but only six required hospitalization. Hail did extensive damage to roofs and autos mainly in Lake Worth and Saginaw. 	Initial tornado damage in Arlington occurred at a restaurant on South Cooper street. The tornado moved east and gained strength, doing F3 damage near Bardin and Matlock (707 PM), south of I-20. The tornado then struck the northern part of Arlington Airport (F2). The tornado paralled I-20, crossing the Interstate about one mile west of Highway 360, overturning at least one 18-wheeler (F1)(712 PM). The tornado then began moving northeast, ending with F2 damage to subdivision just northeast of Grand Prairie airport (near Arkansas and Parkside)(720 PM). In spite of the damage, there were no deaths or serious injuries in Arlington or Grand Prairie.	One commercial building was destroyed in Arlington, and 22 others damaged.

The storm produced a prolific path of large hail, a brief tornado, and a significant wet microburst across central and east central Wisconsin.  The storm was one of the most damaging thunderstorms in Wisconsin history, producing well over $100 million in damage.The thunderstorm developed north of a warm front, which was located across the Wisconsin/Illinois border.  The setup was favorable for what is known as "elevated" convection; that is, the source of the instability was aloft, and not surface-based.  Elevated convection often produces large hail, and the May 12 storm was no exception.As the storm moved into central Wisconsin, numerous reports of large hail were received from Waushara and Winnebago counties.  Baseball size hail was observed with the storm in Waushara county, two miles east of Coloma and in Dakota.  Hail damaged many of the roofs of the more than 1,000 homes in Omro (Winnebago co.) alone.As the storm intensified, it produced extensive damage across Calumet and Manitowoc counties as microburst winds developed.  Wind-driven hail shredded west-facing sides of homes and businesses that were caught in the path of the storm.The worst damage in Calumet county was in and around Chilton, where 2 inch hail and hurricane-force wind gusts (estimated near 80 mph) knocked holes in siding and tore the walls and roofs from some buildings.  Over 1000 homes were damaged in the city of Chilton.  Two hundred more sustained damage in the township of Charlestown.A brief tornado occurred as the storm entered Manitowoc county, but did no damage.  At about 1150 a.m. CDT, microburst winds near 100 mph and 2 inch hail combined to produce very serious damage in St. Nazianz.  Most of the homes in a mobile home park in St. Nazianz were overturned or knocked off their foundation by the straight-line wind.  Thirty people were injured in Manitowoc county, most in St. Nazianz.    In Manitowoc county, over 100 homes were destroyed by the combination of wind and hail.  Many more were damaged.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 46M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The damage began on the southwest side of the city with reports (including ham radio, media, and spotters) of large hail and wind gusts estimated over 80 mph.  The largest hail size was estimated at 4 1/2 inches, which caused extensive damage over $6 million to more than 2000 homes, mainly roof and siding damage.The hail and wind blew out many windows,  injuring one person with flying glass. The storm knocked out power to over 20,000 residences. Damage to vehicles was even more costly. Several automobile dealerships sustained major damage to nearly every car in their lots...totaling around 1000 vehicles. One man was injured in his vehicle when a hailstone crashed through his windshield, causing facial lacerations. In addition, the storm produced flash flooding, with many streets rendered temporarily impassable.  A National Weather Service damage assessment reported dozens of trees damaged and snapped...was concluded to be due to straight-line winds and hail, not a tornado.  An automated weather observation station at the Florence airport,  just east of the city, recorded a peak wind of 59 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was the third round of severe thunderstorms to strike southern Wisconsin due to the same basic weather pattern.  Hailstones the size of baseballs (up to 3 inches in diameter) pounded the northern 3 mile stretch of these two counties, resulting in substantial damage to hundreds of homes (roofs and siding) and hundreds of vehicles.  Two people in Marquette County and 4 people in Green Lake County were injured by the large hailstones and needed medical treatment. The hailstones left impact marks on sidewalks in the Crystal Lake area of north-central Marched County. In Green Lake County crop damage was also noted.  Downburst winds of 60 to 70 mph also accompanied the hail, resulting in many trees being pushed over. Interestingly, this severe hailstorm occurred north of a warm front, with air temperatures only in the 60s. The warm front moved north to a Wisconsin Dells to Sheboygan line while a frontal "triple-point" formed near the Dells due to a cool front pushing in from the west. The thunderstorm which first produced hail in Sauk County while moving northeast, gradually turned more to the right (east), as it entered Marquette, Green Lake, and Waushara Counties, and transformed into a high-precipitation supercell. Eventually this supercell did spawn a tornado in Manitowoc County, and 100 mph straight-line winds in Calumet and Manitowoc Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The hailstones left impact marks on sidewalks in the Crystal Lake area of north-central Marched County. In Green Lake County crop damage was also noted.  Downburst winds of 60 to 70 mph also accompanied the hail, resulting in many trees being pushed over. Interestingly, this severe hailstorm occurred north of a warm front, with air temperatures only in the 60s. The warm front moved north to a Wisconsin Dells to Sheboygan line while a frontal "triple-point" formed near the Dells due to a cool front pushing in from the west. The thunderstorm which first produced hail in Sauk County while moving northeast, gradually turned more to the right (east), as it entered Marquette, Green Lake, and Waushara Counties, and transformed into a high-precipitation supercell. Eventually this supercell did spawn a tornado in Manitowoc County, and 100 mph straight-line winds in Calumet and Manitowoc Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Weak surface troughs combined with upper support to initiate storms.  The storms downed trees and power lines and dropped large hail as they moved through northeast Wisconsin.  Two people were injured by quarter size hail at a golf course in Alaska (Kewaunee co.).  A tornado briefly touched down northeast of Forestville (Door co.) with one of the storms.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
