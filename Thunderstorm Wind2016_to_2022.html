The focus of the severe weather was across central and southern Mississippi.  This event was driven by a potent disturbance that swung across the area during the midday and afternoon hours. As this strong feature dropped into the Lower Mississippi River Valley, a surface low rapidly deepened as it tracked across central Mississippi. The atmospheric response to this was for a rapid increase in winds aloft and higher low level moisture. This combination set the stage for an unstable environment that contained high levels of wind shear which supported and sustained tornado development.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An intense microburst occurred along the Lincoln/Copiah County line. Damage occurred just west of Jackson-Liberty Road and north of Norton-Assink Road. Here a mobile home rolled multiple times and was destroyed. A couple of minor injuries occurred at this location. Other damage that was noted was many uprooted trees along nearly a 3 mile swath. All of the uprooted trees were blown down to the east-northeast. Along Old Red Star Road, the roof of a metal shed was blown off and tin was blown into a tree along with some tin peeled off the corner of a roof of another home. The width of this damage was nearly 1 mile wide with max winds around 95 mph.

The event occurred at Mistletoe State Park in northern Columbia County, GA. Nearly 200 trees had limb damage, were uprooted or snapped. There was a mixture of hardwood and softwood trees, however softwood trees made up most of the trees in this area of the park. There were approximately 10 vehicles that suffered significant damage. There were 10 to 15 campers that suffered significant damage with one overturned. The overturned camper was a pop-up camper. The wind being channeled into a couple of the coves may have produced some of the strongest winds with the event. The diameter of the trees damaged ranged from around 6 inches up to 2 feet. The damage stretched from the park ranger residence northward to the end of the point where the campground is located. This distance is approximately one half mile. There was one injury associated with this event. A 5 year old female child inside one of the campers that was struck by a fallen tree suffered a broken arm. About $25,000 in damage was done to the cabins at the park. Damage estimates for the vehicles and campers is unknown.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This allowed a very warm and excessively humid air mass to be in place over the area.  As temperatures rose through the 80s and into the 90s, dewpoints were unusually high in the mid to upper 70s.  By the afternoon hours, this produced heat index values over 100 degrees in many valley areas, with some spots in the mid-Hudson Valley seeing heat index values approach 110 degrees.||At the same time, a surface cold front was approaching the area from the west.  Some clusters of thunderstorms developed in the early to mid afternoon hours across the Lake George-Saratoga Region, producing damage to trees and power lines.  In addition, one storm in the Lake George area contained a lightning strike, which injured multiple people huddled under a tree.||By the evening hours, a more organized line of thunderstorms moved from west to east across all of eastern Upstate New York.  This line produced widespread wind damage, with the most concentrated damage in the Pine Lake area of northwestern Fulton County. ||In addition to the gusty winds, the thunderstorms also produced a significant amount of cloud-to-ground lightning. Over 50,000 customers lost power at the height of the storms as a result of the gusty winds and lightning strikes.||Thunderstorms ended with the passage of the cold front during the overnight hours.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> At least 59 structures and 18 vehicles were damaged or destroyed at Pine Lake Campground due to downed trees from thunderstorm winds.

As a mid-level disturbance lifted out of the Southern Plains, multiple storm clusters and bowing segments formed across Missouri in a very favorable environment for severe thunderstorms. There was also a supercell thunderstorm in the Ozark foothills during the evening. Dew points were in the lower 70's in many locations in the afternoon, coupled with surface cape values of 3000-4000 j/kg. Boundaries left over from early morning storms also played a role in the placement of afternoon thunderstorm development. Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms impacted the middle Mississippi Valley on the first day of the Memorial Day holiday weekend. There were two or three bowing lines of thunderstorms that impacted the region with damaging winds. Individual cells and clusters also developed early on in the event, producing both large hail and strong winds. Multiple rounds of storms over the same locations also resulted in locally heavy rainfall.

Additional severe thunderstorms developed later in the morning and affected areas of southern Middle Tennessee from the late morning into the early afternoon hours. Widespread damaging winds were reported in nearly every county along and north of I-40 across Middle Tennessee, with winds estimated up to 90 mph in some areas. These intense downburst winds caused 3 injuries - two in Clarksville when a tree fell on a mobile home, and one in Lavergne when a tractor trailer flipped over. In addition to the damaging winds, 7 confirmed tornadoes also touched down from the Nashville metro area eastward to the Upper Cumberland, damaging hundreds of homes and businesses. Several reports of large hail were also received in parts of southern Middle Tennessee.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An 8 mile long swath of wind damage struck the north side of Clarksville in association with a small mesovortex on HPX radar.

The tornado did extensive damage to the downtown area where two buildings were completely destroyed and numerous others were damaged. One person was killed in an accident cleaning up debris from the tornado when a tractor rolled and pinned the person beneath it. The storms produced a path of damaging winds from Nora Springs (Floyd County) and Mitchell (Osage County) east to Waukon (Allamakee County). Within this path, winds were estimated to range from 65 to 80 mph with numerous trees and power lines blown down. Southeast of Waukon, a barn was blown down trapping a farmer in the debris. The Governor of Iowa declared a disaster proclamation for Allamakee, Chickasaw, Clayton, Fayette, Floyd and Winneshiek Counties. The President of the United States issued a disaster declaration for Allamakee, Chickasaw, Fayette and Mitchell Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A farmer sustained injuries when the barn he was doing chores in was blown down on top of him.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 30.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These storms produced several instances of severe wind gusts as they traversed the Texas South Plains, in addition to a wall of dust followed by heavy rains and minor flooding. As this squall line decayed after sunset, additional storms fired along its outflow from the southeast Texas Panhandle through the Rolling Plains. One of these storms east of Childress produced a dust storm that contributed to a fatal multi-vehicle accident near Kirkland.  After midnight, a small line of showers and some thunderstorms redeveloped over the western South Plains and moved south. Although radar indicated very weak precipitation intensities with this line, a macroburst and possible heat burst developed shortly after 0230 CST on July 4th and proceeded to strike the north and east sides of Levelland with fierce straight-line winds of 80-110 mph.  In addition to causing widespread wind damage, two vehicles were overturned by these winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A significant downburst with winds estimated as high as 110 mph struck the northern half of the city of Levelland causing widespread damage to buildings, trees, utility poles, and even rolling two cars from the road.  An NWS damage survey team determined the most intense winds were focused about 2.5 miles east of downtown Levelland.  It was in this area that a pole barn's metal support beams were ripped from their anchors and a car along State Highway 114 was blown off the road and flipped over.  The driver of the car was shaken, but not injured.  Damage elsewhere was consistent with winds of 70 to 90 mph and was comprised of peeled back roofs on some buildings and mobile homes, some street signs bent flat to the ground, many large trees snapped at their base, and even a trampoline wrapped around a power pole.  Three industrial buildings sustained substantial damage. Sections of streets were so cluttered with structural debris that front-end loaders were required to clear a safe path for travel. One man was injured as the awning he was grilling under collapsed and dragged him a short distance. Approximately 40 power poles were damaged leading to some residents being without power for 11 hours.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Another round of training storms developed the night of the 16th, fed by a moist low-level jet. Training storms and slow storm motion led to heavy rainfall across Douglas, Bayfield, Ashland and Iron counties. Three day rainfall amounts of 6-10 inches were common through these counties with a vast majority of it falling during the night of the 16th into the 17th. Areas of central Bayfield county saw in excess of 15 inches or rainfall during this event. This led to historic flooding focused in the Drummond, Grand View and Benoit areas of Bayfield County, along with the Foxboro, Chaffey and Dairyland areas of western Douglas County. The KDLH radar failed during the evening of June 16th and frequent lighting prevented the restoration of service until after daybreak on the 17th, resulting in the main radar covering this event not being available. One man was killed after his vehicle left the road and went into a ditch filled with 6-8 feet of water near the Bad River south of Ashland. Additionally, one or more microbursts were reported in central Sawyer County near Grindstone Lake resulting in tree damage and damage to homes. One man was killed when a tree fell on his camper near the town of Edgewater. The runoff from the storms continued to cause problems into the new week as it led to significant rises on area rivers and additional flooding. Damages estimates of $95,706 for Ashland County, $3,988,546 for Bayfield County, $66,180 for Burnett County, $3,875,140 for Douglas County, and $701,922 for Iron County, totaling $8,727,494.

Most of the storms were sub-severe with occasional gusts of 40 to 50 mph noted on airport ASOS/AWOS sites. Other thunderstorms began to develop across south central Minnesota and moved northward toward the Twin Cities area. ||By the mid to late afternoon, temperatures rose into the 90s with CAPE values of 1500-2000 J/Kg. Due to weak wind shear, most of the storms were outflow dominant, but occasional severe wind gusts occurred with the stronger cores. Two storms produced significant wind damage near Geneva, north of Albert Lea, Minnesota, and Hutchinson, Minnesota. A turkey barn was destroyed near Geneva, and three people were injured but recovered from their injuries. Around Hutchinson, there were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines. Some of the trees caused damage to homes.  The local emergency manager in McLeod County determined that there were about 5-6 houses in Hutchinson that received structural damage from trees.||In addition, McLeod County declared a state of emergency on May 30, 2018 as a result of these high winds. An initial damage assessment was conducted and determined that there was about $54,000 in estimated public assistance damages.||Other storms produced an occasional hail stone up to quarter size. However, most of the storms were only producing dime to nickel size hail with wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A NWS storm survey indicated that a severe downburst wind, with an estimated wind of 80 mph, occurred from near the intersection of 310th Street, and 820th Avenue, |north-northeast for approximately one mile. Several trees were uprooted, with a trailer and a turkey barn that were destroyed near the end of the path. Three injuries occurred, but were not life threatening. Other trees and power lines were blown down in the city of Geneva which is likely associated with another downburst around the same time.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

First was a wave of strong to severe storms during the morning hours across much of northern Iowa, followed by a subsequent wave of storms across southern Iowa. Respectively, the storms produced primarily severe hail and then severe winds and heavy rainfall.  ||Environmentally, the setup was relatively prime for organized convection and to a degree, training storms.  A relatively stationary front (slowly drifting southward later in the day) laid across Iowa from southwest to northeast throughout the day on the 28th. On the warm side of the boundary,  MUCAPE values were in excess of 2000 J/kg already early in the morning, growing to 3000-4000 J/kg by the afternoon. Other supporting factors for organized convection were present as well, including 40 to 50+ kts of effective bulk shear, hail CAPE in excess of 600 J/kg (especially in the morning round), and effective storm relative helicity around or in excess of 200 m2/s2. Understandably, composite indices such as the significant hail parameter and the supercell composite parameter returned values that raised concerns for severe weather potential. ||At the end of the day, reports were split into two distinct areas. The first was large hail over northern Iowa with the early morning convection, followed by damaging winds and heavy rainfall with the afternoon and evening convection over southern Iowa.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Law enforcement reported a semi-truck blown over by winds on Interstate 35.

This particular event featured a complex of thunderstorms that resulted in wind damage along a track nearly 400 miles long, originating in Central Tennessee and ending along the Gulf Coast. The southward movement of these storms was driven by clockwise flow around a ridge of high pressure centered over the Central United States.  In Central Alabama, the storms moved through during peak daytime heating with a very unstable air mass in place. CAPE values of 4,000-5,000 J/kg were common while bulk wind shear values were low due to the proximity of the upper ridge. Steep low-level lapse rates aided in momentum transfer of strong winds aloft to the surface. Wind damage occurred not only with the thunderstorms, but with the outflow as well.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Lineville city police reported a fatality when a large tree fell on a moving vehicle.

Widespread wind damage occurred with this long-lived complex, which met the definition of a derecho. Southeast Missouri was on the western flank of the complex, where wind damage was limited to a few isolated reports. This convective system took shape over the Missouri/Iowa border region and then progressed south-southeast to the Tennessee Valley by late evening. A very moist and unstable air mass set the stage for this derecho. Surface dew points were near 80 degrees, with mixed-layer capes over 4000 j/kg. When the atmosphere is that unstable, wind shear does not need to be particularly strong for significant severe weather to occur. The bulk wind shear in the 0 to 6 km layer averaged 20 to 30 knots. Deep northerly wind flow averaged around 20 knots from 850 to 500 mb on the front side of a high pressure ridge.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A person was struck and injured by a flying awning at the intersection of Highway 51 and U.S. Highway 61.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Initially, thunderstorms were supercells, and formed along a warm front that lifted through North Dakota in the afternoon and evening hours. One of the supercell thunderstorms produced flash flooding in Dunn and Mercer counties, while another produced 3.50 inch diameter hail over Wells County. During the evening and overnight hours a line of intense thunderstorms developed along a cold front that swept into western North Dakota, and tracked eastward across the state. Widespread wind damage occurred throughout much of western and central North Dakota, but the strongest winds centralized generally along and about 20 miles north and south of Highway 200, where episodes of microburst enhanced winds occurred. Within this corridor, many grain bins were lost, farm buildings and campers damaged or destroyed, and trees uprooted or snapped. The greatest wind damage occurred near Stanton, Mercer County, where a microburst with estimated 130 mph winds destroyed a farm. One fatality occurred at Heckers Lake in McLean County as an individual was outside a camper, and the camper tipped over onto him. There were also four injuries in that area around New Johns and Heckers lakes where many campers were damaged or destroyed, some being blown into the lakes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> About 30 camping trailers at Heckers Lake and New Johns Lake were damaged and destroyed, with many overturned.

Additional strong and severe wind gusts accompanied a few of these storms resulting in straight line wind damage at times.

The strong wind field associated with this system included another anomalously strong low-level jet, with 925 hPa winds sampled on the 12Z/19 TAE Sounding around 40 knots! This advected warm, moist, and unstable air northward, ahead of a pre-frontal trough which served as a focusing mechanism for convection. Instability was initially lacking Thursday Night, but increased on Friday, with Mixed Layer CAPE ranging from 1-1.5k J/kg. Furthermore, the 12Z/19 TAE Sounding revealed Surface Based CAPE of nearly 2.4k J/kg, which is a record for the date per SPC Sounding Climatology! The instability and Bulk Shear (0-6 km) over 50 knots overcame the poorer mid-level lapse rates, and the QLCS intensified as it moved east of the Flint and Apalachicola Rivers on Friday. Despite Shear (0-1 km) around 35 knots on the 12Z/19 TAE Sounding, the hodograph revealed a more unidirectional wind within this layer, however there may have been slightly more veering based on the nearby observations from TLH.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tree was blown down onto a home near Woodville Highway.

The warm front continued to gradually mix north northwest into East Texas and Northcentral Louisiana by late morning and early afternoon hours, with a very warm, moist, and unstable air mass noted over Deep East Texas and portions of Northcentral Louisiana south of the front. Coupled with even stronger forcing and low level shear ahead of the approaching upper trough, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed near and south of the front from late morning through the afternoon, producing numerous reports of damaging winds with several tornadoes across portions of East Texas.

The winds snapped the support wires that had been holding up the tower causing the tower to break in half and fall onto the roof of the building it had been mounted on and the ground next to the building.

These storms produced several reports of damaging winds which downed trees and power lines across portions of McCurtain County Oklahoma, before diminishing shortly after daybreak with the departure of this system.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Several large trees fell onto a mobile home west of Valliant on Sandpiper Road near the Choctaw County line.

MUCAPE values very quickly approached and exceeded 4000 J/kg by mid-morning. With the cold front and previous storm outflows the impetus for new convection, discrete storms were not expected, with the prevailing storm type being the linear or quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) variety. Additional support for the QLCS mode was seen with, once again the cold frontal and outflow forcing, highly unstable atmosphere, and little to no convective inhibition.  Additional support for strong winds was seen with DCAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg across much of the area  Once a system began to produce a decent cold pool, there would be little to prevent it from progressing. ||That was evident in Iowa as two distinct QLCSs moved through. First in the morning hours across northern Iowa, and second during the late morning through evening hours from central Iowa and on toward south central and southeast Iowa. In both cases, damaging winds widely prevailed. Across northern Iowa the gust front roared out ahead of the line of convection, continuing to produce severe wind reports in areas of no storms well to the south and east. In central and southeast Iowa, widespread reports of 60 to 70 mph winds and various tree damage (from large limbs to entire trees) were received along a path from roughly Perry, IA through Ottumwa, IA.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Some inflatables were blown away from a town celebration.

MUCAPE values very quickly approached and exceeded 4000 J/kg by mid-morning. With the cold front and previous storm outflows the impetus for new convection, discrete storms were not expected, with the prevailing storm type being the linear or quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) variety. Additional support for the QLCS mode was seen with, once again the cold frontal and outflow forcing, highly unstable atmosphere, and little to no convective inhibition.  Additional support for strong winds was seen with DCAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg across much of the area  Once a system began to produce a decent cold pool, there would be little to prevent it from progressing. ||That was evident in Iowa as two distinct QLCSs moved through. First in the morning hours across northern Iowa, and second during the late morning through evening hours from central Iowa and on toward south central and southeast Iowa. In both cases, damaging winds widely prevailed. Across northern Iowa the gust front roared out ahead of the line of convection, continuing to produce severe wind reports in areas of no storms well to the south and east. In central and southeast Iowa, widespread reports of 60 to 70 mph winds and various tree damage (from large limbs to entire trees) were received along a path from roughly Perry, IA through Ottumwa, IA.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous tents on the fairgrounds were blown down with people in them causing some injuries.

The predominant weather revolved around damaging winds and heavy rainfall, though a few instances of severe hail and low end tornadoes were experienced as well. Among the reports, numerous trees were downed, buildings damaged or destroyed from straight line winds or one of the weak tornadoes, and numerous instances of 2 to 4 plus inches of heavy rainfall. ||On the setup side of the coin, a lot of factors were in line for the event to potentially be a sustained nocturnal severe weather event. The previous day, the 19th, saw surface high pressure begin to exit the region eastward and allowing southerly return flow to work into eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. Tied in with mid to upper 70 dew points and steep mid-level lapse rates, a large area of 4000 plus J/kg CAPE values developed across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa and slowly built eastward. Additionally, effect bulk shear was consistently in the 40 to 50 kt range and low level shear roughly oriented to expected storm motion. As the evening progressed and the low level jet finally began to ramp up, boosting warm air advection and positive moisture flux, storms began to develop and eventually congeal. Organization, at least with regards to strong to severe criteria, was not immediate, waiting until around 5am local time to produce its first severe report.

At least one fatality and one critical injury have been attributed to the remnants of Olga.||Tropical Storm Olga formed in the Gulf of Mexico Friday afternoon near the Louisiana coast. Olga then transitioned to a Post-Tropical Storm and merged with a cold front as it quickly lifted northeast through the Lower Mississippi River Valley on Saturday. As Olga���s remnants moved into the Mid-South, sustained winds of 30-40 mph were reported at several sites for up to an hour as the storm passed over. The first instance of damage occurred near Houston, Mississippi, where county-wide tree damage was observed. Widespread damage continued along a north-northeast track for nearly 150 miles as it moved through Mississippi and Tennessee. Numerous trees, power lines, and structures were damaged along the path, before Olga���s remnants moved east of the Tennessee River. Some of the most impressive winds were recorded at Tupelo Municipal Airport. Multiple wind gusts of 50-70 mph occurred for nearly 45 minutes as Olga moved through. The circulation maintained its intensity as it tracked north into Corinth, MS and eventually into Adamsville, TN, where some of the worst damage was observed. Winds were estimated to be in the 75-100 mph range. Damage continued through west Tennessee along the Tennessee River and eventually crossed over Interstate-40. Several semis were flipped along the interstate as winds remained very strong. Damage continued into Camden, Tennessee before crossing the Tennessee River.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Straight line winds caused significant damage across McNairy County.  880 homes were damaged and 21 homes were destroyed.

A few storms developed ahead of the approaching cold front in the late evening hours of the 20th, producing tornadoes in Dallas and surrounding areas. Additional storms formed a squall line along the cold front, producing a large swath of damaging winds across North and Central Texas overnight into the early hours of October 21st. A total of 10 tornadoes were identified by NWS Survey teams, occurring both within the storms ahead of the cold front, and embedded within the squall line. The strongest of these tornadoes was an EF-3 that stretched almost 16 miles across the northern portions of Dallas County. Following on the heels of that tornado, an EF-2 tracked about 2.5 miles through Garland in Dallas County. The remaining count of tornadoes included 4 EF-1s and 4 EF-0s. Miraculously, no one was killed or significantly injured in any of the tornadoes! The total estimated cost of insured damage for all the tornadoes alone is over $2 billion, which the Insurance Council of Texas claims is the most costly tornado event in the state's history. Of the straight line wind damage, the most severe was located in Farmersville in Collin Co where a mobile home was rolled and destroyed. Three people were injured in the home.

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tree was blown down onto and destroyed a mobile home near Moorhead.

A warehouse building collapsed at the corner of Highway 70 and Northside Drive, and part of the roof was blown off the Cumberland Farmers Co-op Building in Crossville. A tractor trailer was blown over on Taylors Chapel Road, and a metal garage was destroyed at North Cumberland Elementary School. Old Jamestown Highway and I-40 at mile marker 319 were both blocked by downed trees, and numerous other roads were blocked by fallen trees, power lines, power poles, and other debris. 1 person was injured at the Deer Run RV Park in Fairfield Glade when a tree fell through an RV. Peak wind gusts of 63 mph were measured at both the Crossville Memorial Airport ASOS and the City of Crossville downtown Davis weather station, which were located on the south edge of the macroburst. Winds in the core of the macroburst were estimated up to 95 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Strong southerly winds drew unseasonably warm, moist air northward into the region ahead of a cold front. Early morning temperatures were in the upper 60s and lower 70s with dewpoints in the upper 60s. This aided in the development of uncapped surface-based instability that was more than sufficient to maintain the QLCS. A strengthening  shortwave trough was lifting northeastward across the Ozarks during the event resulting in strengthing wind fields and ample wind shear.  The QLCS evolved into a Line Echo Wave Pattern (LEWP) with several persistent mesovortices across north Mississippi and a few transient mesovortices farther north into west Tennessee. Widespread damaging wind was observed across the entire County Warning Area (CWA) along with 13 tornadoes. In addition to the severe weather potential, heavy rainfall was a noted threat. Isolated flash flooding did occur with this system.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Thunderstorm winds moved across Tunica, MS and areas south and east of the community. Several industrial buildings were damaged south of town. The Tunica AWOS recorded a peak wind gust of 79 mph.

An upper level jet stream moved over West Texas and produced more lift in the atmosphere. A cold front moved south into the area and stalled near the Pecos River. There was moderate instability and high moisture and wind shear across the area.

This storm strengthened as it moved into Reeves County and produced significant damage to the Highway 285 RV Park about 15 miles southeast of Orla. It was determined by a National Weather Service survey team that damage to the RV park was the result of rear-flank downdraft winds which was a straight-line wind event. The survey team estimated the wind speeds to be 100-130 miles per hour based on damage to the RV park. This was based on damage to trailers, outbuildings, vehicles, and other structures. It was determined that the swath of damaging winds was around 300 yards wide and 0.75 miles in length. There was one major injury related to this event.

Additional minor structural damage occurred in Flora. Dozens of homes across the county received damage from wind and from trees falling onto them, and several roads were closed due to fallen trees. Roofing and structural damage occurred to buildings and homes around the Gluckstadt area, including some busted windows and air conditioning units due to wind driven large hail. The service area of the Quick Lube and Tire shop in Gluckstadt experienced significant structural damage. A wall also collapsed at a commercial building along Nissan Parkway. Numerous softwood trees were snapped and uprooted along the Natchez Trace Parkway between mileposts 114 and 123. Several trees were uprooted or snapped in the Lake Caroline area.

This storm was somewhat isolated in the damage it caused, but the worsts of this two day event occurred the next day. The morning of May 4 started out incredibly active across eastern Kansas and western Missouri. In eastern Kansas several supercells formed and moved eastward into western Missouri. The initial round of supercells were generally decaying as they progressed eastward, but one particular supercell formed an enhanced downburst in western Bates County and produced between 70 and 90 mph winds. Upstream of this supercell in eastern Kansas 15-20 power poles were snapped near the intersection known as Jingo, KS. This storm then went on to produce heavy damage to trees and structures between Amsterdam and Butler. It was in this area just west of Passaic that a single fatality occurred when a tree fell into a house.

Meanwhile, a strong upper level low opened up into a trough as it entered the Southern Plains during the evening of the 11th, with large scale forcing ahead of the trough enhancing shower and thunderstorm development across much of West-central, Central, East and Southeast Texas during the evening through the early morning hours. Given the extent of shear, instability, and upper level forcing in place across the warm sector, numerous showers and thunderstorms developed over these areas, which quickly spread east northeast into East Texas around and shortly after daybreak on the 12th. Some of these storms were severe, producing numerous reports of damaging winds, large hail, and locally heavy rainfall which resulted in isolated flash flooding. Two isolated tornadoes also touched down in Shelby and Southern Harrison Counties. ||While there was a lull in the thunderstorms from late morning through much of the afternoon, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed across portions of Northeast Texas well behind the dry line which had mixed east to near Texarkana into Western Louisiana, and near the center of the upper level trough. Steep lapse rates aloft and the drier low level air mass contributed to areas of damaging winds and isolated instances of large hail, with the majority of the wind damage from a collapsing thunderstorm which originated just east of Dallas, and quickly moved east along the I-20 corridor in East Texas. Aided by strong pressure rises behind an associated cold front, a large swath of damaging winds were noted with the severe gust front, with gusts ranging from 50-70 mph well ahead of the collapsed storm. This resulted in numerous reports of downed trees and power lines across East Texas and Western Louisiana, with AEP Swepco noting that over 64,000 customers were without power at one time in the aftermath of the storms. These damaging winds exited East Texas into Western Louisiana by early evening before gradually weakening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A large tree snapped and fell on a 60 year old male standing in his driveway, fatally injuring him.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It was a very warm afternoon, with high temperatures in the 80s to lower 90s. It was 92 degrees at Harrison (Boone County) and Russellville (Pope County), and 91 degrees at Mena (Polk County), and Mountain Home (Baxter County). Normal highs are in the upper 60s to mid 70s.||The heat and increasing moisture made the atmosphere extremely unstable. However, thunderstorms had some difficulty developing. Data acquired from a balloon launch by the National Weather Service at the North Little Rock Airport (Pulaski County) revealed warming aloft (an inversion) at 100 pm CDT. Readings went from 68 degrees at 2000 feet to 75 degrees at 2500 feet. This tended to cap the lower levels of the atmosphere, and prevented storms from taking off. For most of the afternoon, there were few clouds.||Capping was weakest in the northeast, and this is where isolated storms finally went haywire by 500 pm CDT. One storm in particular peaked the interest of radar operators and kept them busy for several hours. The storm unleashed baseball size hail at Strawberry (Lawrence County), and golf balls at Horseshoe Bend (Izard County), Lynn (Lawrence County), and Ravenden (Lawrence County).||The biggest event of month happened on the 12th (Easter) and 13th. There were more than 1,000 reports of wind damage and at least 130 tornadoes from Texas to the Carolinas. Sadly, there were three dozen casualties.||We had to deal with a line of nasty thunderstorms. The line had bowing segments, indicating that powerful winds were driving the storms forward and causing them to bulge outward. Severe Thunderstorm Warnings were first issued between 530 pm and 600 pm CDT, and continued for five hours until the storms moved east of the Mississippi River. The storms produced damaging wind gusts from 60 to more than 80 mph, and knocked out power to at least 150,000 utility customers.||There were numerous reports of trees and power lines downed, with trees blocking roads in some cases. Trees fell on residences, resulting in a death at White Hall (Jefferson County) and an injury at Glen Rose (Hot Spring County). Outbuildings and sheds were damaged or destroyed. A roof was blown off of a poultry farm on Highway 154 north of Danville (Yell County). A 68 mph gust was measured at Petit Jean State Park (Conway County).||Much of Arkansas received one to more than three inches of rain, with the heaviest amounts over central and southern sections of the state. Monticello (Drew County) had an estimated 3.73 inches of precipitation on the 12th, breaking a daily record that stood since 1877.||This was one of the more significant downpours of the month, and contributed to largely above average rainfall totals. Surpluses of liquid in April were more than an inch at Little Rock (Pulaski County), and Pine Bluff (Jefferson County).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous trees and power lines were down in the area.

The most concentrated area of damage was located at 595 Charlie Norris Rd, where several large barns, a greenhouse, and the top of a silo all experienced major structural damage. All of the barn and silo damage was moved from the SW to the NNE at a distance of up to half a mile. The medium sized greenhouse had its entire roof structure destroyed. A single-wide mobile home was turned and rolled once or twice, with three people inside. The three people all sustained bruises and cuts, with the most significant being a female who was thrown into a fish tank and had to go the hospital. An old farmhouse adjacent to the mobile home sustained major roof damage as well. All across the property, there were uprooted and snapped trees. Across the street, on the west side of the road, a medium sized barn was completely destroyed.At 645 Charlie Norris Rd, there was extensive tree damage, especially cedar trees, along with outbuildings and barns. The home owner had recently built a new fence with posts in concrete, and some of these posts were leaning or lifted out of the ground. The owner was putting away a small John Deere tractor about a minute before the storm struck and the winds were so strong, it lifted the tractor almost a foot off the ground and rotated it approximately 60 degrees. A smaller house on the property experienced damage on the front porch, which had its foundation lifted, damaging the roof and gutter. The emergency manager in Clark County KY reported sporadic wind damage across the county, mainly in the form of tree damage. One of the most concentrated areas of damage was 470 Ford Hampton Rd in Winchester.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The heavy rains resulted from a deep plume of tropical moisture lifted northward ahead of the cold front. Heavy rain began during the evening of April 12th and exited the region shortly after sunrise on the 13th, lasting roughly a 12-hour period. Between 1.5 and 4 inches of rain fell across the mountains and foothills, with pockets of 4 to 7.5 inches observed near the crest of the Blue Ridge. ||Given the heavy rainfall rates, the result was mainly flash flooding of small creeks and streams.  Hardest hit were portions of Watauga County, NC, where 4 to 7.5 inches fell county-wide.  Extensive flooding was observed along the East Fork of the South Fork of the New River, near the Hidden Hills neighborhood.  Multiple homes were evacuated due flooding, with many long-time residents reporting that this event was the highest that river had risen in at least 20 years. Flooding elsewhere across Watauga County was not as severe, with some roads flooded. National Water Model simulations of this basin indicate that the flooding may have risen to a 25 to 50-year recurrence interval.    ||Flooding extended into Ashe County, NC where multiple roads sustained severe damage, being either partially or totally collapsed/washed out where they intersected smaller creeks. Many other counties across the mountains and foothills reported mainly flooded roads with little to no other damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Thunderstorm winds blew a tree onto a wooden outbuilding on J.

Approximately ten minutes later, a homestead was heavily damaged about seven miles south-southwest of Memphis. At 1810 CST, a metal building, several more homesteads, and trees were damaged along Texas State Highway 86 west of Estelline. Microburst winds were estimated between 80 and 100 mph based on the damage indicators gathered during a NWS storm survey.||A second severe storm formed south-southwest of Lubbock Preston Smith International Airport around 1930 CST. This storm then tracked to the east-southeast developing severe wind gusts within the city of Lubbock. The winds toppled a brick wall of an old roofless structure, downed power poles, and caused considerable property damage at Joyland Amusement Park. In addition, a few people were injured by falling tree limbs at Joyland.||Additionally, the intense heat required a helicopter rescue of an individual from Caprock Canyons State Park in Briscoe County.

The strongest winds were experienced in central and east-central Iowa where 100+ mph winds were observed. Some of the strongest winds were in an area from roughly Marshalltown, IA eastward along the Highway 30 corridor to the Mississippi River, where estimated winds exceeded 120+ mph and approached 140 mph. A number of QLCS tornadoes were also experienced within the Highway 30 corridor. One of the most remarkable aspects of the derecho was the duration of severe winds, with many areas experiencing at least periodic, if not persistent, severe level (58+ mph) winds over a roughly 30 minute time frame. As the derecho moved eastward out of Iowa, it continued to expand, but weakened from its peak strength. Winds continued to exceed severe criteria (58+ mph) in Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan and began to produce additional QLCS tornadoes across northern Illinois before fading out across northern Indiana and southern Michigan.||In the wake of the derecho, damage was substantial in many areas, rural and urban. Many agriculture fields, mainly corn, were flattened within the swaths of strongest winds. Initial estimates suggest at least 850,000 acres of partial or complete crop loss occurred from this event. Within urban and wooded areas extensive tree and structure damage was seen, including complete roof failure in a few instances. At its peak, total estimated customers without power exceeded 1.4 million across the affected states. In total, early estimates on losses (agriculture, infrastructure, private property) have exceeded $7.5 billion across the states affected. ||Environment: Broadly speaking, it was a ripe day for thunderstorms across the affected area with MUCAPE values often exceeding 3500-4000 J/kg by the mid morning hours concurrent with mid-upper level short wave support, and indications that any cold pool development would be strong (difference between cold pool and ambient air) and potentially long lived. For detailed environmental analysis, including soundings, please view the various local NWS office event review pages: NWS Des Moines, NWS Quad Cities, NWS Chicago, NWS Milwaukee, NWS Central Illinois, NWS Northern Indiana, or NWS Indianapolis.||Additional Details: Numerous injuries occurred during the derecho and in the aftermath during cleanup, including 4 direct and indirect deaths of which 3 occurred in Iowa (two in Poweshiek County and one in Linn County) and 1 in Indiana (Fort Wayne).||Disclaimer: The August 10, 2020 derecho resulted in widespread high-end damage across large portions of central and southern Iowa. Given the size and scope of the event and understanding that final damage and loss estimates (agriculture, infrastructure, and private property) will take months to complete, the NWS is not able to estimate the monetary impact at this time. Values may be added as more data becomes from various sources in future months.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Law enforcement reported a large tree fell on a home.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The cost of damage from this storm was extreme, reaching an estimated 7.5 billion dollars along the path of these storms from Iowa through Illinois.  Two brief tornadoes have been confirmed within the widespread swath of wind damage, one just north of the Eastern Iowa Airport in Linn County Iowa, and one just south of Freeport, Illinois. These tornadoes have been designated as EF-U, as there was no observable damage directly attributable to the tornadoes from which an EF-scale rating could be assigned. While an average of two derechos a year occur across the area, a derecho of this intensity is a roughly once-in-a-decade occurrence. Another unusual aspect of this derecho was the duration of the strong winds, with gusts over 60 mph for over an hour at some locations.||The most extreme winds, estimated at 110-140 mph, destroyed or damaged numerous outbuildings, barns, grain bins, homes, mobile homes, apartment buildings, trees, and power poles in parts of Benton, Linn, Jones, Cedar, and Clinton Counties. The Cedar Rapids area was particularly hard hit. One fatality occurred in Linn County, as a tree fell on a cyclist. Several homes, apartment complexes, and businesses sustained damage consistent with 130-140 mph winds. Radio transmission towers in Marion and Clinton, Iowa collapsed due to winds estimated around 130 mph. Wind gusts of 80-100 mph were common as the line of storms moved through the Quad Cities area and then through northwest Illinois. A small pocket of winds estimated at 100-110 mph impacted Princeton, IL in Bureau County, where a 150 foot communications tower collapsed and numerous power poles were snapped. In addition to the damage, numerous long-duration power outages occurred across the region. Damage to crops was considerable along the derecho path. Numerous semi trucks were also blown off roadways along the path of the derecho.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Widespread straight-line winds that produced extensive damage were reported throughout Linn County, associated with a derecho. These winds lasted around an hour in total at any one location, even though the initial line of storms moved out quickly. Damaging straight-line winds continued and were associated with the rear inflow jet. Maximum wind speeds were estimated to be 80 to 100 MPH for much of the county, with areas in central Linn County that had wind speed estimates that were 120 MPH or higher. The highest estimated wind speed were in the Cedar Rapids area where extensive damage to an apartment complex occurred with damage indicating winds about 140 MPH. A radio transmission tower also collapsed with wind speed estimated at 130 MPH. These estimates were determined based off damage reports and photos submitted through social media as well as a damage survey. The peak thunderstorm wind gust measured at the Cedar Rapids airport ASOS before it lost power was 68 MPH. The duration of strong winds caused extensive damaged most if not all trees, crops, and structures in their path. Due to the widespread damage, long duration power outages occurred. One fatality occurred here when a 63 year old man riding a bicycle was struck and killed by a tree that was knocked down due to the winds. There were also numerous injuries reported in the Cedar Rapids area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Several trees and power lines were blown down.

Most of the wind damage occurred with the passage of a rare derecho; a large fast-moving complex of thunderstorms with powerful straight-line winds.  In addition, strong wind gusts from 59 to 71 mph not associated with the derecho, occurred prior to and following the passage of this system over the urban corridor and plains of northeast Colorado.||By midday the derecho, which originated over the Great Basin, moved over the northern and central mountains, and then rapidly northeast across the I-25 corridor by mid afternoon.  These storms then tracked across the plains from late afternoon into the early evening hours.  Wind gusts from 60 to 80 mph were common with a few gusts exceeding 90 mph.  The highest gust observed was 110 mph, at the Winter Park Ski area, around 12000 feet.  Xcel Energy said in a press release that more than 208,000 customers lost power because of the storm statewide. The intense wind toppled a billboard that crashed onto Denver bakery.  Two delivery trucks parked nearby were heavily damaged.  Two injuries occurred in Denver, one seriously.  A man and his nine-year-old daughter were injured by a fallen tree.  They were standing in front of a family member���s house when the incident occurred.

The environment ahead of the QLCS was unusually unstable for this time of day and year, with gulf moisture spreading upper 60 F to near 70 F dewpoints into a warm sector across the Southeast United States and mid level lapse rates around 7 C/km helping produce mixed layer convective available potential energy (MLCAPE) as high as 2000 J/kg across Southeast South Carolina. Within the warm sector, very strong vertical shear associated with a 50 knot plus low and mid-level jet, effective bulk shear around 70 knots, effective storm relative helicity in the 400-600 m2/s2 range, and VAD wind profiles displaying large, curved low-level hodographs were supportive of well organized convection and potentially embedded supercell thunderstorms in a QLCS capable of producing a prolonged path of damaging winds and strong long-track tornadoes. As the QLCS swept through Southeast South Carolina, a few supercell thunderstorms became exceptionally strong while partially breaking away from the main line of thunderstorms, producing widespread wind damage and strong long-track tornadoes. ||A total of 13 confirmed tornadoes occurred across Southeast South Carolina, including a long track EF-4 tornado in Hampton County that took the lives of 5 people and injured 60 others along an approximately 24 mile path. The EF-4 tornado was the first to have occurred across Southeast South Carolina and the last to have occurred in the entire state of South Carolina since November 17, 1995, almost 25 years prior. This particular tornado was associated with a storm that produced a destructive path of straight-line wind damage and series of long track and intermittent tornadoes for over 150 miles, beginning in Screven County, Georgia, then continuing northeast across Hampton County, Colleton County, Dorchester County, and Berkeley County, South Carolina before leaving the area and eventually shifting offshore along the South Carolina coast. Two other storms were responsible for the remaining tornadoes across the area, most of which occurred from a single storm occurring across Edisto Island, Seabrook Island and Kiawah Island. Outside the EF-4 tornado in Hampton County, straight-line winds near a passing tornado claimed the life of one individual and injured one in Colleton County, while another tornado caused 6 injuries across Berkeley County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Colleton County Fire Rescue Emergency Management Division reported a tree down on a residence in the 700 block of Barracada Road due to strong inflow winds near a passing tornado.

Deepening surface low pressure tracked across Michigan and into Ontario during the day, whipping a cold front across the region during the late morning and early afternoon. Some of the classic ingredients for a widespread wind event were present, including a negatively- tilted trough, jet positioning over the region, and a favorable Great Lakes surface low track. Strong post-frontal 3 hour pressure rises of 5-7 mb were observed, and a low-topped mostly lightning-free convective line accompanied the boundary. Widespread wind gusts of at least 45-55 MPH were observed, with several higher measured gusts seen.  Along the convective line, gusts of 55-65 MPH likely occurred. This resulted in widespread reports of wind damage to trees and power lines, with a few instances of mostly minor structural damage.

A hot, moist, and tropical air mass entered the region behind the front for June 10th, resulting in high temperatures in the upper 80s and lower 90s and dew points in the 70s across the region. Heat indices in Northwest Ohio reached the upper 90s during the afternoon of the 10th. A shortwave trough and associated surface cold front entered from the west, allowing for showers and thunderstorms to develop over western Ohio around 3 PM on the 10th in the warm, unstable air mass. Storms began as discrete or clustered cells over western Ohio before congealing into a squall line. This squall line propagated from west to east across northern Ohio but individual cell motion was from south-southwest to north-northeast as the line moved through northern Ohio on the evening of the 10th. The main threat from severe thunderstorms were damaging winds with the strongest winds occurring in Northwest Ohio. Storms produced wind gusts up to 80 mph in the Lake Erie Islands and adjacent mainland areas of Ottawa and Erie Counties in Ohio, with wind damage across Oak Harbor, Catawba Island, Port Clinton, Marblehead, South Bass Island, and Sandusky. Another powerful segment of the line moved across Marion County, including the city of Marion, prompting sporadic damage in the city with wind gusts up to 80 mph. There was one injury with this event in Marion as a facade of a building collapsed onto a nearby vehicle. The intensity of the squall line waned as it passed east of Interstate 71, though it remained severe with sporadic wind damage. As the squall line moved east of Interstate 77 after dark, the line intensified as the storms caught up to the outflow, and backed winds ahead of the line rejuvenated the thunderstorms. Some strong storms moved across Trumbull and Mahoning Counties, producing additional wind damage before moving into Pennsylvania.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Marion County Emergency Management provided evidence of significant wind damage across the Marion area due to severe thunderstorm winds of up to 80 mph. Numerous trees and power lines were downed across the city with several large trees falling onto residences. Winds ripped off a significant portion of a roof of an industrial building on the west side of Marion. Winds also caused the brick facade of a building in downtown Marion to collapse onto a vehicle. The vehicle was occupied at the time of the damage and the female occupant sustained minor injuries. There was also evidence on social media that a gustnado may have formed with the squall line that moved through the Marion area just before 6 pm local time.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 125.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These initial storms grew upscale given concurrent downstream destabilization through northeast Nebraska and northwest Iowa. Widespread 80-100 mph winds developed through central/eastern Iowa as this derecho matured. Northern bookend and advection wing forcing led to some supercell structures across northern Illinois/southwest Wisconsin. Northern bookend turned northeast as it moved across Lake Michigan and tracked into western Michigan. As this occurred, attendant post convective wake low weakened as it crossed the lake. Thus the local area did not experience the 80 to 100 mph winds that N IL/E IA experienced. However the resultant slowing and breakup of the line as it moved across northwest Indiana/SW Michigan, yielded a LEWP and subsequent multiple small scale circulations developing along the line. These meso-vortices were associated with pockets of enhanced wind damage and brief tornado occurrences.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A mobile home rolled due to a failure of 1 or more properly secured straps from strong winds. A 74 year old woman was  critically injured and later died at a nearby hospital. The woman was holding a 4 year old boy that only suffered minor injuries. The home rolled into an adjacent double wide mobile home. The initial mobile home was destroyed but all debris remained near the site. The adjacent mobile home suffered damage to the side and roof due to the home striking it. Other damage in the area was limited to some skirting of the mobile homes.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Wind in this area was estimated at 70-80 mph. A roof was ripped off a warehouse building on the 1600 block of Lincoln Highway. Another roof was partially removed from a building on the 1700 block of Lincoln Highway. A roof was partially removed from a barn and a shed was destroyed on the 2500 block of Grant Point Rd.

Significant flooding occurred along the I-20 corridor where storm total amounts were in the 3-6 inch range, with isolated amounts near 8 inches.  Near Tuscaloosa, a private dam failed and the subsequent flooding washed out a water and sewer main at Nucor Corporation���s steel plant. This in turn damaged the city's sewage system, prompting officials to issue water restrictions for 100,000 people. Flooding destroyed five homes and severely damaged thirty-eight in Northport and Tuscaloosa. Residential and infrastructure damage between the two cities reached $3.35 million. Two fatalities occurred in Tuscaloosa County when a large tree fell on a mobile home.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A large tree fell on a mobile home located off Hargrove Road East and  resulted in two fatalities.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A series of surges along this line caused localized severe wind gusts that produced numerous downed trees and power lines across southern Minnesota. One of the storms produced an EF0 tornado south of Henderson in far southeast Sibley County. ||As this line moved across the southern Metro of the Twin Cities, three tornadoes briefly spun-up leading to multiple power outages, plus major damage to Savage public works building and a large transformer for the city of Savage. In addition, the power outages caused local schools to close temporarily Friday morning. Another area of tornado damage occurred in Apple Valley and Burnsville. Most of this damage was due to trees falling on houses and vehicles.||A 64 mph wind gust was measured by the ASOS at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. At MSP Airport, with the strong winds and possibly brakes not being applied and/or improper chocking, two Sun Country aircraft slid into each other and into jetways H3 and H4, causing fairly significant damage.||Outside the tornadic activity, several sources of private and public weather sensors measured wind speeds of 40 to 55 mph across a wide swath of southern Minnesota. These winds coupled with heavy rainfall, caused numerous downed small trees and large branches across a 25 to 50 mile wide area from Redwood Falls, to St James, then northeast to New Ulm, Shakopee, St. Paul, and into parts of west central Wisconsin.||In addition, near Mankato, MN around 0730 UTC, a 4-year old girl was killed when a tree branch fell on the tent where she and her family were camping. There were  approximately 80,000 people without power during the peak of the severity that moved through the metro area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tree branch fell onto a tent at the Land of Memories Park.

Temperatures broke several long-standing records. Memphis hit 80��F which broke a 103-year-old high-temperature record. ||A strong upper-level trough was approaching from the west, providing strong lift within the unseasonably warm and unstable air mass.  MLCAPE reached the 1500-2000 J/kg range by 6 PM. The wind field was impressive with plenty of vertical wind shear needed for organized thunderstorms. Effective 0-1 km storm-relative helicity values ranged from 300-400 m2/s2 with effective bulk shear values of 70 knots - more than sufficient to support discrete supercells in the warm sector ahead of the cold front.||The first supercell developed in central Arkansas and tracked into northeast Arkansas producing a few weak tornadoes initially before intensifying across eastern Craighead and Mississippi Counties and killing two people. The tornado eventually strengthened into an EF-4 while moving through the Missouri Bootheel, resulting in 2 direct and one indirect fatality in Pemiscot County. The tornado then tracked across the Mississippi River into northwest Tennessee, producing an additional 4 fatalities near Reelfoot Lake. This tornado lifted for a brief time in Obion County, reorganized, and then moved into Kentucky. All told, the mesocyclone tracked for over 300 miles and was producing tornadoes for over 250 miles. This storm was responsible for at least 9 fatalities and many injuries in the NWS Memphis CWA along with millions of dollars of damage. ||As the initial supercell was crossing the state line into Kentucky, a string of supercells was moving into eastern Arkansas. A few brief tornadoes produced minor damage near Cash in western Craighead County and in the Fisher area of western Poinsett County. As the dominant supercell moved into eastern Poinsett County, the mesocyclone quickly intensified and the storm produced an EF-2 tornado in Trumann with several injuries and widespread damage. ||A new supercell developed in Mississippi County causing straight-line wind damage initially. This supercell intensified as it crossed the Mississippi River and produced another long-track tornado starting in Dyer County,  Tennessee. This tornado tracked east-northeast across northwest Tennessee into Henry County, and eventually into Kentucky. This tornado was rated EF-3 and resulted in several injuries with Kenton and Dresden, Tennessee being the hardest hit. ||The convection eventually evolved into a QLCS as it moved east. A mesovortex developed south of I-40 near Jackson that resulted in 3 tornadoes across eastern Madison, Henderson, and Decatur Counties including an EF-2. Non-tornadic storms moved across the Memphis metropolitan area, producing straight-line wind damage as a mesovortex moved through the city. A fatality was reported in Shelby County after a large tree fell on a home in South Memphis. Later that night, an EF-1 tornado occurred in Prentiss County before the severe weather threat began to wind down around 6 AM on December 11, 2021. ||In total, there were 18 tornadoes across the NWS Memphis CWA.  Along with tornadoes, several incidents of wind damage and minor flash flooding also occurred.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous trees were knocked down from Orange Mound into East Buntyn.
