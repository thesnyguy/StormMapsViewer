The peak wind gust at nearby Philadelphia International as the line moved through was 36 mph. ||Tides were higher than normal because of the combination of the strong up the Delaware Bay and Delaware River wind flow and the spring astronomical tides associated with the recent full moon. The early afternoon high tide at Reedy Island (New Castle County Delaware) reached 7.50 feet above mean lower low water. Minor tidal flooding starts at 7.20 feet above mean lower low water. The mid afternoon high tide in Philadelphia reached 8.61 feet above mean lower low water.

Wind speeds in the core of the damage path were measured at 77 mph at the NWS in Valley before the wind equipment failed and a private citizen reportedly measured 98 mph winds on their home weather equipment in far west Omaha.  A storm survey done by the NWS estimated that the damage was caused by straight-line winds which reached speeds of 100 to 115 mph in some areas.||The damage swath started in north central Saunders and south central Dodge counties Nebraska and ended in southern Pottawattamie and northern Mills counties Iowa.  Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted along the path of the significant damage along with snapped power and street light poles and scattered house and outbuilding damage.  Corn and other crops in the path were shredded nearly to the ground.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is a continuation of a 5 to 7 mile wide damage path that a bow-echo thunderstorm caused across eastern Nebraska and southwest Iowa.  In Pottawattamie county Iowa it was estimated by a NWS storm survey that winds reached 70 to 90 mph in an area from Council Bluffs to southwest of Treynor and north of Mineola.  There was a concentration of tree damage across this area, which also caused house and vehicle damage.  Two adults were killed and one young female adult was injured in Council Bluffs when a tree crushed the parked car they were sitting in.  Two Semis were blown off the Interstate near Council Bluffs and grain storage units near Treynor sustained serious damage. In Council Bluffs damage was also noted at the City's Recreation Center, the Public Library, the traffic building and a restaurant and golf course.  Damage to trees alone in the northwest part of the city amounted to $275,000.  From Council Bluffs the damage swath persisted to areas south and southeast of Macedonia, though wind speeds were estimated to have weakened to 60 to 70 mph.  MidAmerican Energy reported that 13,000 customers lost power from the storm in southwest Iowa, including around 11,000 in the Council Bluffs area.  According to FEMA and local emergency management damage across the county came to at least $13 million.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 11.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Two events impacted the region in a span of 3 days which produced several tornadoes, large hail and wind damage across the area. ||On January 10th a vigorous storm system developed over the southern portions of the Midwest and moved northeast towards the Ohio valley. A strong cold front swept across the area during the late morning into the afternoon hours and strong to severe thunderstorms developed out ahead of it. All of the ingredients for tornadic development came into place as warm Gulf moisture pushed northward into the area out ahead of the front. The thunderstorms developed in eastern Louisiana and quickly moved across central Mississippi during the late morning and afternoon hours. As the storms progressed eastward, good instability combined with very strong wind shear for supercell development east of the Mississippi River, with the storms reaching maximum intensity along and east of the interstate 55 corridor.||By far, the most damage was produced by a single supercell thunderstorm that moved from north of Vicksburg through north central and northeast Mississippi during the late morning and early afternoon hours. This single storm produced three strong tornadoes, all of which were rated as EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita tornado damage scale. The most significant damage occurred in Caledonia in Lowndes County, where a school gymnasium was destroyed along with a number of school buses and vehicles in the area.||A second supercell that organized near the Mississippi River in southwest Mississippi before midday tracked from Claiborne County, through the northern Jackson Metropolitan Area, and finally into Noxubee county in northeast Mississippi by mid afternoon. This storm was responsible for 5 different tornado touchdowns along its path, as well as many reports of high winds and hail.||The rest of the area saw a broken line of storms and other supercells ahead of the line. A mix of damaging winds and hail were reported through the rest of the afternoon before the system exited the area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Straight line winds, from the forward flank downdraft, produced damage across the south side of West Point. This downdraft came from the supercell thunderstorm which eventually produced the Caledonia Tornado. Several trees were blown down along with a couple power lines. Numerous signs were blown down and a construction trailer was rolled over next to the Wal-Mart. One person was in the trailer and was injured. One building sustained major single damage. All damage was blown toward the south and southeast.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A squall line of thunderstorms developed after midnight on the 25th across Mississippi and Alabama and reached the Georgia/Alabama border around 5 am EST.  The line of thunderstorms intensified and bowed out just as it was moving in Georgia during the early morning hours.  Wind gusts in excess 60 mph affected many counties as these thunderstorms rolled through the area during the early morning hours, causing extensive wind damage to trees, power lines, and some structures from the west and northwest side of Atlanta toward the Alabama border. In addition, two tornadoes, one an EF3, developed along the stronger part of the line as it moved through Carroll county before daybreak causing extensive damage along their paths.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Fulton County Emergency Management Director reported that the same squall line that rolled through several west central and northwest Georgia counties early in the morning caused extensive damage across Fulton county as well.  More than 50 trees were down across the county with at least 20 structures sustaining damage.  A number of power lines were also down across these areas.  The most concentrated damage continued from northeast Cobb county, within a 0.3 to 1.0 mile wide path, into north Fulton county from the Fulton/Cobb county line west of Roswell to just north of downtown Roswell.  This portion of the damage was a continuation of the survey conducted by The Weather Channel.  Hundreds of trees were blown down, several on homes.  More than 300 trees along were blown down in 80-acre Roswell Park on Woodstock Road.  The downed trees caused extensive damage to facilities within the park, including a children's playground, picnic shelters, and a maintenance building.  Damage was reported to homes and other structures in Sandy Springs, Atlanta, Milton, and Johns Creek, College Park, and Fairburn.  Heavy damage was noted in the Sandy Springs area.  A business sign suffered damage near Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.  Two injuries were reported from a home on Moorehouse Drive Southwest in the city of Atlanta when a tree fell on the structure causing the roof and wall to collapse.  An adult male and a pregnant adult female were injured as a result.  Both injuries were non-life threatening.  Damage was reported along Holcomb Bridge Road, Warsaw Road, and Park Bridge Lane.  In Fairburn, two homes were damaged when trees fell on the structures on White Mill and Rivertown Roads.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An upper level disturbance moved northeast from central Texas during the afternoon and evening hours of May 22nd.  The result was widespread severe thunderstorms which produced large hail and very damaging wind gusts.  Numerous reports of trees and powerlines downed across the region with the Texarkana area getting hit very hard once again.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Two severe thunderstorms came together over the south side of the city.  One severe storm was moving northeastward from southern Bowie County while the other was moving northwestward through Miller County.  Both storms collided in an area just south of downtown Texarkana.  As a result of the collision, the storm cores collapsed in an area just east of State Line Avenue over a several block area between 16th and 20th Streets.  Numerous large trees were snapped or uprooted onto homes and cars in the Glendale Subdivision.  As the survey expanded outward to the north near 24th Street and the Woodlawn Cemetery, trees were noted to have fallen in a north or northeastward direction typical of a microburst.  Damage was found as far northeast as the Calvary Cemetery area with trees downed in a north to northeast direction.  Trees were also uprooted and snapped on the Texas side of State Line Avenue with a heavier concentration along Magnolia Street between 24th Street and 30th Streets.  It was noted that the trees fell in a northwesterly direction which would be expected if a microburst had occurred to the south and east of those locations.  Numerous homes were damaged on the Texas side of State Line Avenue as a result.  Powerlines were also downed throughout the area as a result of either poles snapping or trees falling on the lines.  The area impacted by the microburst is approximately 3.5 miles long to the northeast of the origin and 4 miles in width from one end of the damage swath to the other.  City and County officials estimate that 44 homes sustained major damage with an unknown number of vehicles damaged.  At least 100 damage reports have been collected thus far.  Only one minor injury occurred when a tree fell on a home injuring an elderly woman inside.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A bowing line of thunderstorms was the culprit with the main axis of severe weather and damage having occurred within the I-20 corridor from northeast Louisiana to the Jackson Metro to east-central Mississippi around Meridian. Several extensive swaths of significant wind damage occurred, where winds were estimated at 80 mph or greater. Overall, several thousand trees were snapped and uprooted with several dozen homes damaged by downed trees. The strongest tornado occurred in the Jackson Metro area as it moved across Northeast Jackson and into the Reservoir area of Northwest Rankin County. Additionally, the significant wind damage was focused across portions of Vicksburg, Bolton, Jackson, the Reservoir area of Rankin County, the Hillsboro area in Scott County, northern Newton County and the northern half of Lauderdale County. Aside from the tornadoes, this was one of the most significant wind events to impact the Jackson Metro area as well as the City of Vicksburg. Nearly everyone described this event as being worse than Hurricane Katrina for central Mississippi.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous trees were blown down across the eastern portions of Vicksburg with some across I-20. A few homes were damaged by downed trees along with several power lines. One mobile home was totally destroyed along Warriors Trail as a tree fell through it. An injury occurred at this location as the occupant was briefly trapped in the home.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The winds were accompanied by hail up to golf-ball size.  The combination of wind and hail damaged crops west of Cedar Bluffs with trees and crops severely damaged from Cedar Bluffs to Woodcliff.  A boyscout camp hosting about 1,000 people north of Cedar Bluffs was hit, seriously injuring one parent when a tree fell on him.  Center pivots were also flipped from west of Cedar Bluffs east to the county line and some farm outbuilding damage was noted. A semi was flipped on Highway 77 a few miles south of Fremont.  In the Woodcliff area the winds appeared to have been the strongest with several boats and boat lifts flipped and many homes sustained damage due to fallen trees.  In addition to the tree and subsequent home damage by fallen trees, the wind whipped hail caused additional damage to siding, roofs and vehicles.  Around 160 of the 440 homes in the Woodcliff area sustained damage.  It was estimated that around 35,000 acres of crops were destroyed in Saunders county, with the plants virtually shredded to the ground in some areas.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This storm propagated southeastward during the evening hours, and impacted portions of Hall and Childress Counties. The storm produced at least two wet microbursts near Childress. The downburst winds, estimated to approach 100 mph in the city, combined with large hail caused widespread and significant damage and resulted in 6 injuries. Virtually every structure in the city sustained damage, including more than 1,800 homes and 200 businesses. Economic losses totaled $20 million.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An extreme convective wind event combined with large hail resulted in widespread and significant damage in the Childress vicinity during the evening hours of Father's Day the 15th.||The Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet site northeast of the city initially recorded a 58 mph wind gust at 19:33 CST. By 19:35 CST winds at the mesonet site had increased to 80 mph. Witnesses described that rain from the storm, which had approached from the northwest, had come to an ended and that the storm appeared to have passed without incident. A rapid onset of damaging winds and hail, however, then struck from the east. ||A National Weather Service disaster assessment found eye witness descriptions to be consistent with the resultant damage patterns and photographic evidence, which conclusively indicated that a series of wet microbursts impacted the surface east-northeast of Childress. Extreme outflow winds, estimated to approach 100 mph, spread westward across the city as they diverged from the epicenter of the downbursts. In addition to photo and video evidence of multiple microburst occurrences, the cyclic nature of the downbursts was measured by the Texas Tech University West Texas Mesonet, which recorded a secondary 80 mph peak in wind gusts at 19:50 CST.||Local and state officials determined that 1,821 homes and more than 200 businesses were impacted by the storm. Damages to 247 homes were deemed major with six homes totally destroyed. Four rooms in a local motel collapsed, and more than half a million dollars in damages were inflicted upon a local hospital. Medical patients from both the hospital and a nearby nursing home were evacuated to neighboring communities. Up to sixty utility poles and a number of signs were additionally destroyed. ||Six persons were injured by flying debris during the storm. Those injured included a small child that was struck in the head by debris, and a woman that was hit by a screen door which became air-borne.||The American Red Cross reportedly provided food and shelter for approximately 500 Childress residents following the storm.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 16.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was pushing an equally unusually strong cold front for early August into the southeast U.S.  This front combined with a very warm humid air mass, partially a result of the lingering remnants of Hurricane Dolly, to result in the development of numerous strong to severe thunderstorms in far north Georgia during the mid to late afternoon hours.  Thunderstorms across north Georgia merged into a near solid arched band of thunderstorms which raced southward during the evening hours into the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Large hail and intense cloud-to-ground lightning accompanied the thunderstorms in north Georgia.  Leading outflow winds produced a wind gust of 71 mph at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport as the thunderstorms came through around 730 pm EDT.  The thunderstorms subsequently diminished as they pushed further south of the Atlanta area, but redeveloped once again into strong to severe thunderstorms during the late evening as the outflow boundary pushed into the Macon area and nearby counties.  Numerous reports of downed trees were received from many north and central Georgia counties as a result of these thunderstorms.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Cherokee County Emergency Management Director reported that thunderstorm downburst winds blew down dozens of trees on the east and north side of Lake Allatoona.  A number of trees were also down between the eastern side of Lake Allatoona and Woodstock as well.  Several campers were damaged at the Sweetwater Campground and one person at the campground sustained non-life threatening injuries when a large tree fell on their tent.  In addition, playground equipment was damaged at a park in Woodstock from a large downed tree.  Several roads were blocked from downed trees and many power lines and also down in the area.  Up to 25,000 people in the area were left without power for several hours following the storm.  The Cherokee Tribune reported that up to 134 homes in the area sustained at least minor damage from wind and/or lightning.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the storms moved southeast, they began to tap into warmer, more humid air and rapidly evolve into a line of severe thunderstorms. Widespread damage occurred in a wide swath extending from Long Lake in McPherson County all the way into eastern Grant County and southern Big Stone County in Minnesota.  The most extensive damage was generally found along and near US Highway 12 from Aberdeen to Milbank. Several observing stations in the path of this system measured wind speeds ranging from 70 mph to over 115 mph.  Estimated wind speeds from damage surveys indicated even stronger winds with peak speeds of 120 mph. ||Over fifty communities in northeast South Dakota and the surrounding rural areas received minor to major tree and structural damage as straight line winds from 70 to 120 mph raced across the area. Webster and Waubay received the most extensive damage from the storms. Thousands of trees were snapped or uprooted, hundreds of grain bins were damaged or destroyed, hundreds of homes, businesses, and outbuildings were damaged or destroyed along with many power poles and miles of power lines downed.  Many mobile homes, campers, and boats were damaged or destroyed along with many road and business signs. Countless homes, vehicles, and campers were also damaged by fallen trees.||Thousands of acres of crops were also damaged or completely destroyed by the winds and hail. The greatest crop damage occurred in the Roslyn, Grenville, Eden, and Pickeral Lake areas in Marshall and Day counties. Many acres of corn were blown down and not able to come back. The large hail combined with the strong winds also broke out countless windows in homes and vehicles along with damaging the siding on homes. Thousands of people were left without power for up to several days. Large hay bales were moved up to 700 yards by the high winds. A semi was overturned on Highway 12 near Webster, injuring the driver. Near Milbank on Highway 12, two other semis were blown off the road resulting in injuries to both drivers. A State Forestry Specialist said it was one of the worst tree damage events he has ever seen in the Webster area. A fifty-eight year old man died two miles north of Waubay during the cleanup after the storms when he was pinned between a backhoe and a tree.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The lumber yard and cabinet shop in Webster were destroyed. Power lines and poles were downed along with hundreds of trees. A semi was overturned on Highway 12 west of Webster injuring the driver. Several other injuries occurred in Day County as a result of the windstorm. The injuries were minor to moderate with scrapes and abrasions to lower back injuries and a broken collar bone.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the storms moved southeast, they began to tap into warmer, more humid air and rapidly evolve into a line of severe thunderstorms. Widespread damage occurred in a wide swath extending from Long Lake in McPherson County all the way into eastern Grant County and southern Big Stone County in Minnesota.  The most extensive damage was generally found along and near US Highway 12 from Aberdeen to Milbank. Several observing stations in the path of this system measured wind speeds ranging from 70 mph to over 115 mph.  Estimated wind speeds from damage surveys indicated even stronger winds with peak speeds of 120 mph. ||Over fifty communities in northeast South Dakota and the surrounding rural areas received minor to major tree and structural damage as straight line winds from 70 to 120 mph raced across the area. Webster and Waubay received the most extensive damage from the storms. Thousands of trees were snapped or uprooted, hundreds of grain bins were damaged or destroyed, hundreds of homes, businesses, and outbuildings were damaged or destroyed along with many power poles and miles of power lines downed.  Many mobile homes, campers, and boats were damaged or destroyed along with many road and business signs. Countless homes, vehicles, and campers were also damaged by fallen trees.||Thousands of acres of crops were also damaged or completely destroyed by the winds and hail. The greatest crop damage occurred in the Roslyn, Grenville, Eden, and Pickeral Lake areas in Marshall and Day counties. Many acres of corn were blown down and not able to come back. The large hail combined with the strong winds also broke out countless windows in homes and vehicles along with damaging the siding on homes. Thousands of people were left without power for up to several days. Large hay bales were moved up to 700 yards by the high winds. A semi was overturned on Highway 12 near Webster, injuring the driver. Near Milbank on Highway 12, two other semis were blown off the road resulting in injuries to both drivers. A State Forestry Specialist said it was one of the worst tree damage events he has ever seen in the Webster area. A fifty-eight year old man died two miles north of Waubay during the cleanup after the storms when he was pinned between a backhoe and a tree.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Many trees were downed throughout the city of Milbank.

In addition, a dense snowpack rapidly melted as a result of the warm temperatures and rainfall, resulting in rapid rises on river and streams as well as widespread problems with flooding of low areas and ditches. Rainfall amounts ranging from a couple inches to locally over 7 inches was reported, with the highest amounts in and around White county.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous roads across Fulton county were at least partially, if not fully impassable with flood waters from low areas, creeks, streams and rivers. County officials closed all roads to general travel from the evening of January 8th to the morning hours of the 9th. Reports of a Chevy Tahoe in deep water with children trapped was received by dispatch centers in Fulton and Kosciusko counties around 750 am Tuesday morning. The vehicle was located on County Road 600 North between 825 and 900 East near the Fulton/Kosciusko county line. The driver of the vehicle, a 29 year old female, reported coming over the top of a hill and unknowningly drove into flowing water over 600 North. By the time she realized what was going on the vehicle stalled and was subsequently carried by nearly seven feet of water into an adjacent field. The driver was able to rescue three of the five children, ages four, one and three months. However, flood waters overtook the vehicle and two children, a two year old girl and five year old boy drowned in the SUV. Due to the fast current, a boat and front end loader were used in the rescue. A Mentone firefighter suffered minor injuries during the rescue.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 125.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A very slow-moving cold front over southwest Illinois and southeast Missouri provided the focus for prolonged heavy rainfall. A deep southwest wind flow brought subtropical moisture across the frontal zone. Two-day rainfall amounts included 13.05 inches at Cape Girardeau and 12.50 inches at Marble Hill (Bollinger County). The highest amounts were just over a foot from Cape Girardeau westward across the hilly terrain of Bollinger and Wayne Counties. At the Poplar Bluff airport, the two-day total was 7.11 inches. Other two-day totals included: 12.52 at the Cape Girardeau airport, 12.08 at Jackson, and 6.30 at Perryville. The rainfall at Cape Girardeau was the greatest single-day rainfall total on record. It contributed to the all-time wettest month at Cape Girardeau. The lowest amounts were near the Missouri Bootheel (in and near New Madrid), where around 4 inches fell. The Missouri National Guard was activated to assist with emergency operations in the hardest hit counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Historic flooding occurred after 12 to 14 inches of rain fell in 48 hours.

Evacuations were conducted in some places, especially in Glenallen. About 23 people were rescued from a subdivision near Zalma due to flooding of the Castor River. Evacuation shelters were opened. Numerous water rescues were conducted around the county. Marble Hill was described as cut in half by severe flooding of Crooked Creek, which rose 8 to 10 feet above a major state highway into town. Much of Marble Hill was inundated. Schools were closed, businesses shut down, and campgrounds were evacuated. Many gravel roads were washed out, and many small bridges were destroyed. Initial estimates were that 75 percent of the county's roads were damaged. The emergency management director for the county reported 14 businesses and 15 homes in Marble Hill suffered severe damage. Fifteen homes in Glenallen and 30 homes in Zalma were severely damaged. A school and other public buildings were extensively damaged. A mobile home was washed away and smashed into trees.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.80M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A very slow-moving cold front over southwest Illinois and southeast Missouri provided the focus for prolonged heavy rainfall. A deep southwest wind flow brought subtropical moisture across the frontal zone. Two-day rainfall amounts included 11.64 inches at Anna (Union County) and 11.50 inches at Galatia (Saline County). At the Carbondale airport, the two-day total was 6.61 inches. Other two-day totals included: 7.66 at Harrisburg, 7.53 at Mt. Carmel, and 10.50 at Du Quoin.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Two persons died after their truck stalled in floodwater on a secondary road near Waltonville. The three occupants of the truck climbed on top of it. One of the victims dropped her purse in the water and dove after it. Two other occupants of the truck dove in to rescue her. One of the rescuers swam to safety, but the other two persons were found submerged in debris about 1,000 yards from the truck. Numerous roads were closed around the county. Schools were closed. Illinois Route 148 was closed at the Big Muddy River bridge as water rose several feet over the bridge. Route 37 was closed south of Mount Vernon. One family in Mount Vernon was displaced when the basement walls caved in. At least fifty basements were flooded in the city.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 58.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The flooding affected many municipalities island wide.  The torrential rainfall resulted in severe flooding to rivers, streams, and roads, causing sinkholes, land/mudslides, and structural collapses mainly across the southern half of the island.  Specifically, the heaviest rainfall, and most severe effects, occurred across the municipalities of Cabo Rojo, Guayama, Humacao, Patillas, Ponce, and Yabucoa, where in some locations, totals approaching 30 inches of rainfall fell in a three-day period, ending at 8 am Tuesday, September 23, 2008.The heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding were a direct result of a large tropical disturbance that moved slowly west across the island.  On occasion, tropical disturbances may develop into tropical depressions and, upon further intensification, get named by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) as a tropical storm and/or hurricane. While the National Weather Service (NWS) in San Juan and the NHC closely monitored the system for possible organization into a named storm, multiple reconnaissance flights flown through the disturbance revealed no closed, low-level, surface circulation, which was needed to satisfy the definition of a tropical depression.  It was not until 5 pm Thursday, September 25, 2008 when the system, located about 380 miles north northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico, was named Tropical Storm Kyle. The strongest effects of the tropical disturbance were first felt in Puerto Rico on Sunday, September 21, 2008.  The most intense rainfall occurred in the 24-hour period starting at 8 am Sunday, September 21, 2008 through 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008, with the highest rainfall rates occurring during the overnight hours from sunset on Sunday to sunrise on Monday.  The largest rainfall amounts for the 24-hour period ending 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008  were 22.03 inches in Patillas, 20.00 inches in Guayama, 16.00 inches in Cabo Rojo, 14.83 inches in Yabucoa, and 10.81 inches in Ponce.  For the combined three-day period, some of these numbers increase further with 29.83 inches in Patillas, 21.86 inches in Yabucoa, 20.52 inches in Ponce, and 17.82 inches in Cabo Rojo.  Lesser, but just as significant, amounts, ranging from 5-15 inches of rain, fell across much of the island.  The torrential rainfall seen across the island was immediately seen across the extensive river network in Puerto Rico.  Some rivers, including the Rio Gurabo, saw water levels rise in excess of 25 feet in less than 12 hours.  Parts of the island that were spared the worst of the rain include the northern and northwestern coast, were only moderate rain showers were experienced.  The total rainfall amounts recorded from this event are unique in that the 29.83 inches seen in Patillas exceeds the weekly total rainfall of 27.13 inches measured in Juana Diaz during the October 1985 flood event.  The 24-hour rainfall totals ending at 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008, which encompassed parts of the southeastern section of the island, including the municipalities of Patillas and Guayama, exceeded 200-year 24-hour rainfall totals.  Specifically for Patillas, the recorded rainfall amount approaches the 500-year 24-hour rainfall totals.  Along the southwestern section of the island, Cabo Rojo���s 24 hour rainfall also exceeded the 100-year return period. Across the southern municipalities of Puerto Rico, Ponce and Yauco���s 24-hour rainfall rates exceeded the 10-year 24-hour rainfall totals, Juana Diaz exceeded the 25-year rainfall totals, and Yabucoa, along the southeast coast, exceeded the 25-year rainfall totals. The resultant flooding had considerable effects on the local population. Six fatalities were reported, three direct deaths due to drowning, and 3 indirect heart attack deaths related to stress induced flooding. An estimated 630 people in the affected areas were evacuated to shelters. In addition to structural damage caused by the flood waters, agricultural damage was sustained by coffee, plantains, and other minor crops, damage was preliminarily estimated at 23 million. In response to the significant flooding, federal authorities issued a disaster declaration for portions of the island.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flooding was reported in the following sectors of Ponce, La Lula, Highway 1 in front of Mercedita Airport, Madrigal, Barrio Los Chinos, and Barrio Tamarindo.

Some of the same areas heavily flooded during January were once again flooded to near record levels.  February flooding was more widespread and persisted longer than flooding during January.  One person was killed because he drove into  a flooded road.  Snowfall of up to 10 inches accumulated during the early days of February in northern Indiana and portions of east central Illinois.  This snow quickly melted by the morning of the 6th as temperatures rose into the 50s on the 4th and 5th.  Rain of 1 to 4 inches fell in eastern Illinois and much of Indiana on the 5th and 6th.  This combination of rapid snow melt and heavy rain caused extensive flooding of streams and rivers in central Indiana.  The heaviest rainfall was in the east central Illinois, northern Indiana, and eastern Indiana areas.  For the second time in 30 days, flooding approached record levels along the Tippecanoe River in northern Indiana.    The Wabash River approached a major flood from Lafayette to Vincennes.  Flooding along this portion of the Wabash River was the highest since January 2005.  Extensive flooding along the White, Eel, Muscatatuck, and East Fork White Rivers was the highest to date of the winter.  Flood damage along the Tippecanoe River was limited because many residents had not been able to repair January flood damage.  However, some flood damage did result to those who had begun repairs.  The number of people evacuated was much less as well because many homes were uninhabitable.  An agricultural levee south of Terre Haute was over toppled.  A few rural families had roads to their homes blocked by flood waters.  Sandbagging was necessary in the Montezuma and Clinton areas.  One person was killed during the evening of the 6th in Lawrence County.  He drove his vehicle into a road flooded by Indian Creek.  Numerous local roads and several state highways were flooded along Indiana's major rivers.  Flood lasted from a few days in many central Indiana locations to nearly four weeks along portions of the Wabash River in the Hutsonville area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flooding occurred along the East Fork White River in Jackson County, including near Seymour, due to heavy rain and snow melt.  A family of six was rescued from the flooded East Fork White River near County Road 150 East.  The family was taken to the medical center in Seymour for medical treatment after the incident.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong cold front in advance of this system was moving across Mississippi into Alabama during the evening of the 17th.  A wedge cold front was located across north and central Georgia. Very warm, unstable air was present across southern Alabama and southern Georgia, south of the wedge front.  While only marginal instability was present, very strong shear was noted with a 60-70 knot low-level jet evident across Alabama and western and central Georgia.  These systems combined to bring a strong squall line of thunderstorms to west and north Georgia during the mid and late afternoon hours.  Most of the damage associated with this line of thunderstorms was straight-line wind damage.  However, an isolated embedded EF1 tornado within a quasi-linear convective system did occur in west central Georgia in Carroll county.  Meanwhile, along the southern end of the convective line, a long-lived supercell tracked from southern Alabama into southwest Georgia, south of Columbus, and continued on a near 100-mile track across west central and central Georgia from just south of Fort Benning to just northeast of Macon.  Multiple tornadoes, ranging in strength from EF0 to EF1 were reported within broken segments along the track of this supercell, resulting in considerable damage to trees, power lines, and property.  Several injuries were reported during the stronger portion of the tornadic supercell in Taylor and Crawford counties, southwest of Macon.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An aerial and ground survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office of Peachtree City, Georgia and the Georgia State Patrol concluded that the same supercell thunderstorm that spawned a tornado in Alabama, tracked across Stewart, Chattahoochee, Marion, and Taylor counties, continued into Crawford county.  The tornado entered the county five to six miles southwest of Roberta, tracked just north of downtown Roberta, crossed U.S. Highway 341 and continued to a point approximately four miles northeast of Roberta, where it finally lifted.  The tornado reached its strongest intensity while passing through Crawford county as an EF1.  The damage path was about 10 miles long and at various points along the path was 250 yards wide.  Significant damage was reported across the county as a result of the tornado.  The tornado destroyed nine structures and damaged three others, most of which were manufactured homes.  The most significant damage occurred along Walker Chapel Road and Felton Road, southwest of Roberta, and northeast of Roberta along Salem Church Road.  Six injuries, two of which were critical, were reported from the damaged mobile homes in the area of Felton Road.  Numerous trees and power lines were downed along the path of the tornado as well, particularly along Georgia Highway 137/128 southwest of Roberta.  While the supercell continued into Bibb county, the survey concluded that there was no conclusive evidence that the tornado remained on the ground into Bibb county.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 550.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

There was a considerable amount of both DCAPE at 1000-1500 J/kg and cape in the -10 to-30 C. layer of the atmoshpere, between 400 and 600 J/kg.  The freezing level was around 13,200 feet.  The environment was quite sheared with effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range.  LCL values were between 1000 and 1500 meters.  The airmass was initially capped.  During the late afternoon hours, a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over north central into northeast Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly.  Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.  It was located south of the main tornado and was on the ground for a little over a mile in Grundy County.  Initial reports indicated 9 fatalities with 7 in Parkersburg (pop 1889) and 2 in New Hartford (pop 637).  There were at least 50 injuries, with 4 of those in critical condition.  Two of the fatalities occurred a few days after the tornado from injuries sustained in the tornado.  The last fatality occurred on 7 Nov.  A 61 year old female sustained injuries in the stairwell of her home when a 2 x 4 was thrown through her right side lung.  She was hospitalized and died several months later of complications.  Significant structural damage occurred across the southern end of Parkersburg and along a path to just north of New Hartford.  Numerous structures completely destroyed from Parkersburg to near New Hartford.  The tornado continued eastward to just north of the Waterloo and Cedar Falls area.  Significant damage also occurred north of Dunkerton where the tornado increased to its greatest path width. This storm also produced substantial straight line wind damage along the southern periphery of the storm just south of the tornado track.  News accounts indicated that a receipt from Parkersburg was found around 1915 CST 3 miles north of Prairie du Chien, WI, 109 miles to the northeast.  Receipits were also found in Clayton County at Elkader, and full scrapbook pages and photos were found in far northeast Bremer County at Sumner.  Preliminary estimates that straight line winds of 90 to 100 MPH occurred with this storm. At 1637 CST, the Waterloo Airport  recorded a 93 MPH wind gust. Survey results suggest that straight line wind damage was the cause of the severe damage at the recreational vehicle dealership north of Cedar Falls.  At least 627 homes were damaged, including 288 homes destroyed in Parkersburg, 88 in New Hartford, 15 in Hazelton and another 50 in Black Hawk County. In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.  The last F4 tornado to hit Iowa was in Union, Madison, and Dallas Counties with a 56 mile path length on 8 April 1999.  There was one other smaller tornado during the evening.  A tornado touched down in Clarke County and was on the ground for a short time southeast of Osceola.  After the initial thunderstorm area developed over north central and northeast Iowa, a large complex developed over southeast Nebraska. The two areas of storms filled in to form a squall line by the mid evening hours.  The complex over Nebraska then pushed east and northeast along the squall line.  A considerable amount of severe weather was generated during the evening as this occurred.  Along the squall line, high winds and hail were common with the dominant mode of severe weather being hail of up to golf ball in size.  As the MCS out of Nebraska advanced east, a tail extending south from the centroid took on a bow echo configuration and raced east across Iowa at 65 MPH.  Very high winds occurred with this feature with numerous locations reporting winds of 65 to 85 MPH.  Some of the higher winds included an 85 MPH wind gust in the Winterset area and numerous reports of 75 to 85 MPH winds from Madison, Dallas, Warren and Polk Counties.  Lightning struck a house in Ankeny.  The house was set on fire by the strike.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> First EF5 tornado in Iowa since 13 June 1976.

The environment was quite sheared with effective shear in the 40 to 50 kt range.  LCL values were between 1000 and 1500 meters.  The airmass was initially capped.  During the late afternoon hours, a small cluster of thunderstorms formed over north central into northeast Iowa.  The storms became severe very quickly.  Initially, the storms dropped hail up to golf ball in size.  One became a strong super cell and produced a major tornado. This cell, in addition to being tornadic, also produced hail of baseball to softball in size and winds in excess of 90 MPH.  The tornado track was from approximately 2 miles south of Aplington to Parkersburg, then continued to New Hartford and across northern Black Hawk County.  The average path width ranged from 0.6 to 0.7 miles near Parkersburg to just north of New Hartford.  The path constricted to near one quarter mile wide east of New Hartford to north of Waterloo.  The width then increased to near 1.2 miles wide north of Dunkerton before dissipating near the Black Hawk and Buchanan County line.  The tornado was on the ground for approximately 43 miles.  In addition to the main tornado, a satellite tornado was observed by storm chasers and one off duty NWS employee.  It was located south of the main tornado and was on the ground for a little over a mile in Grundy County.  Initial reports indicated 9 fatalities with 7 in Parkersburg (pop 1889) and 2 in New Hartford (pop 637).  There were at least 50 injuries, with 4 of those in critical condition.  Two of the fatalities occurred a few days after the tornado from injuries sustained in the tornado.  The last fatality occurred on 7 Nov.  A 61 year old female sustained injuries in the stairwell of her home when a 2 x 4 was thrown through her right side lung.  She was hospitalized and died several months later of complications.  Significant structural damage occurred across the southern end of Parkersburg and along a path to just north of New Hartford.  Numerous structures completely destroyed from Parkersburg to near New Hartford.  The tornado continued eastward to just north of the Waterloo and Cedar Falls area.  Significant damage also occurred north of Dunkerton where the tornado increased to its greatest path width. This storm also produced substantial straight line wind damage along the southern periphery of the storm just south of the tornado track.  News accounts indicated that a receipt from Parkersburg was found around 1915 CST 3 miles north of Prairie du Chien, WI, 109 miles to the northeast.  Receipits were also found in Clayton County at Elkader, and full scrapbook pages and photos were found in far northeast Bremer County at Sumner.  Preliminary estimates that straight line winds of 90 to 100 MPH occurred with this storm. At 1637 CST, the Waterloo Airport  recorded a 93 MPH wind gust. Survey results suggest that straight line wind damage was the cause of the severe damage at the recreational vehicle dealership north of Cedar Falls.  At least 627 homes were damaged, including 288 homes destroyed in Parkersburg, 88 in New Hartford, 15 in Hazelton and another 50 in Black Hawk County. In addition, 58 had major damage, 33 had moderate damage, 2 were inaccessible, and 93 damaged but able to be occupied. There were also 21 businesses destroyed. Governor Chet Culver declared both Butler and Black Hawk disaster areas with both given the State Declaration.  A Federal Disaster Declaration occurred two days later for both Butler and Black Hawk Counties.  The tornado was rated a low end EF5 by a Quick Response Team (QRT) in portions of Parkersburg and north of New Hartford with peak winds estimated at 205 MPH.  For historical reference, the last F5 tornado to hit Iowa was on 13 June 1976 in Boone and Story Counties in the town of Jordan, with a 21 mile path length.  The last F4 tornado to hit Iowa was in Union, Madison, and Dallas Counties with a 56 mile path length on 8 April 1999.  There was one other smaller tornado during the evening.  A tornado touched down in Clarke County and was on the ground for a short time southeast of Osceola.  After the initial thunderstorm area developed over north central and northeast Iowa, a large complex developed over southeast Nebraska. The two areas of storms filled in to form a squall line by the mid evening hours.  The complex over Nebraska then pushed east and northeast along the squall line.  A considerable amount of severe weather was generated during the evening as this occurred.  Along the squall line, high winds and hail were common with the dominant mode of severe weather being hail of up to golf ball in size.  As the MCS out of Nebraska advanced east, a tail extending south from the centroid took on a bow echo configuration and raced east across Iowa at 65 MPH.  Very high winds occurred with this feature with numerous locations reporting winds of 65 to 85 MPH.  Some of the higher winds included an 85 MPH wind gust in the Winterset area and numerous reports of 75 to 85 MPH winds from Madison, Dallas, Warren and Polk Counties.  Lightning struck a house in Ankeny.  The house was set on fire by the strike.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Tornado moved in from Butler County and became very broad as it headed toward Fairbank.

Two events impacted the region in a span of 3 days which produced several tornadoes, large hail and wind damage across the area. ||On January 10th a vigorous storm system developed over the southern portions of the Midwest and moved northeast towards the Ohio valley. A strong cold front swept across the area during the late morning into the afternoon hours and strong to severe thunderstorms developed out ahead of it. All of the ingredients for tornadic development came into place as warm Gulf moisture pushed northward into the area out ahead of the front. The thunderstorms developed in eastern Louisiana and quickly moved across central Mississippi during the late morning and afternoon hours. As the storms progressed eastward, good instability combined with very strong wind shear for supercell development east of the Mississippi River, with the storms reaching maximum intensity along and east of the interstate 55 corridor.||By far, the most damage was produced by a single supercell thunderstorm that moved from north of Vicksburg through north central and northeast Mississippi during the late morning and early afternoon hours. This single storm produced three strong tornadoes, all of which were rated as EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita tornado damage scale. The most significant damage occurred in Caledonia in Lowndes County, where a school gymnasium was destroyed along with a number of school buses and vehicles in the area.||A second supercell that organized near the Mississippi River in southwest Mississippi before midday tracked from Claiborne County, through the northern Jackson Metropolitan Area, and finally into Noxubee county in northeast Mississippi by mid afternoon. This storm was responsible for 5 different tornado touchdowns along its path, as well as many reports of high winds and hail.||The rest of the area saw a broken line of storms and other supercells ahead of the line. A mix of damaging winds and hail were reported through the rest of the afternoon before the system exited the area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado started by damaging a home and shed along with some tree and power pole damage. Next, a shed was damaged and a combine harvester that was in the shed was thrown into some trees. After moving through a wooded area, the tornado moved into a neighborhood with new, well-built homes. Around 8 homes were damaged in this neighborhood, with around 5 of them being severely damaged. Roofs were ripped off, walls were collapsed, and a few were even moved off their foundations. The tornado moved through another wooded area and emerged into the Caledonia school complex. It was here that the tornado reached its maximum intensity.  The press box and concession stand of the football stadium were destroyed, several medal power poles were bent over, and several trees were knocked down. Numerous vehicles were moved along the ground up to 100 yards, some were flipped over, some had multiple dents from gravel in the parking lot, and numerous windows were broken out. Five school buses were damaged, two of which were flipped over, and one of which was lifted up and ripped apart with the chassis landing in one of the buildings and the frame landing on top of a building. The school gymnasium and a Vocational Tech Building were nearly destroyed with several vehicles including the bus landing inside it. The tornado then left the school complex and moved across the south side of Caledonia.  Around 6 homes experienced significant damage here, mainly to the roofs.  A church was completely destroyed when the roof was lifted up and collapsed on the building. Another church nearby had minor roof damage.  The tornado entered another wooded area causing damage to trees and then emerged along Caledonia-Vernon Road. The tornado moved along the road for several miles. Along this part of the path, numerous single family homes were severely damaged.  The roofs were ripped off and the walls were collapsed on several homes.  Numerous hard wood trees were snapped, several of which fell on cars and homes.   A horse stable was completely destroyed and a high tension medal truss tower was snapped.  Further along the road, several mobile homes were completely destroyed.  One in particular had the body of the trailer blown downwind and the frame was dragged back along the ground in the opposite direction for around 25 yards.  Several cars were moved for a distance around 50 yards at this location as well. The tornado then entered another wooded area causing some tree damage and then weakened before crossing the state line into Lamar County, Alabama. The total path length in Lowndes County was 8.7 miles with an EF3 Enhanced Fujita Scale rating. The total path length for the entire tornado, including each county, was 13.2 miles.||The school complex was occupied by over 2100 students and faculty at the time of the tornado. Yet, the Tornado Warning lead time of 41 minutes allowed the school to place students at the best possible locations. No injuries or fatalities occurred at the school. Also, a day care center with 15 children and faculty was severely damaged, but all 11 had taken cover in an underground storm shelter, so there were no injuries at that location either. In total, there were 15 injuries of which only 3 were considered serious. The 3 serious injuries occurred in the mobile home that was ripped apart with the body moving downwind and the frame in the opposite direction.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Two events impacted the region in a span of 3 days which produced several tornadoes, large hail and wind damage across the area. ||On January 10th a vigorous storm system developed over the southern portions of the Midwest and moved northeast towards the Ohio valley. A strong cold front swept across the area during the late morning into the afternoon hours and strong to severe thunderstorms developed out ahead of it. All of the ingredients for tornadic development came into place as warm Gulf moisture pushed northward into the area out ahead of the front. The thunderstorms developed in eastern Louisiana and quickly moved across central Mississippi during the late morning and afternoon hours. As the storms progressed eastward, good instability combined with very strong wind shear for supercell development east of the Mississippi River, with the storms reaching maximum intensity along and east of the interstate 55 corridor.||By far, the most damage was produced by a single supercell thunderstorm that moved from north of Vicksburg through north central and northeast Mississippi during the late morning and early afternoon hours. This single storm produced three strong tornadoes, all of which were rated as EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita tornado damage scale. The most significant damage occurred in Caledonia in Lowndes County, where a school gymnasium was destroyed along with a number of school buses and vehicles in the area.||A second supercell that organized near the Mississippi River in southwest Mississippi before midday tracked from Claiborne County, through the northern Jackson Metropolitan Area, and finally into Noxubee county in northeast Mississippi by mid afternoon. This storm was responsible for 5 different tornado touchdowns along its path, as well as many reports of high winds and hail.||The rest of the area saw a broken line of storms and other supercells ahead of the line. A mix of damaging winds and hail were reported through the rest of the afternoon before the system exited the area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado started, just west of Ethel, with a path of tree damage which intensified shortly after the beginning point. In some areas nearly every tree was snapped off or uprooted. The tornado reached its widest point as it crossed the Natchez Trace Parkway, where dozens of trees were snapped and uprooted. The tornado caused significant structural damage to several buildings just to the southwest of McCool. One cinder block constructed building sustained nearly total destruction from a combination of a very large hardwood tree falling on it, along with other wind damage. A room addition to the back of a frame home was removed. After the tornado passed McCool, it narrowed and weakened somewhat, with tree damage continuing to occur. The tornado then intensified again as it entered Choctaw County and passed south of the town of Weir. Here a dairy complex was heavily damaged. A well-constructed milking parlor was totally destroyed with all exterior walls collapsed or destroyed. A large 9000 pound trailer was picked up and flipped onto the top of a farm building. Several large wood and metal livestock buildings were totally destroyed. A grain silo was also destroyed. Nearly 300 head of cattle were injured with 10 fatal. After the tornado passed this point, it did not encounter any additional structures, but a path of tree damage continued for several miles before the tornado dissipated near Choctaw Lake. The total path length across Attala and Choctaw counties was 24 miles with a maximum rating of EF3. Maximum winds were around 145 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A mix of damaging winds and hail were reported through the rest of the afternoon before the system exited the area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado started, just west of Ethel, with a path of tree damage which intensified shortly after the beginning point. In some areas nearly every tree was snapped off or uprooted. The tornado reached its widest point as it crossed the Natchez Trace Parkway, where dozens of trees were snapped and uprooted. The tornado caused significant structural damage to several buildings just to the southwest of McCool. One cinder block constructed building sustained nearly total destruction from a combination of a very large hardwood tree falling on it, along with other wind damage. A room addition to the back of a frame home was removed. After the tornado passed McCool, it narrowed and weakened somewhat, with tree damage continuing to occur. The tornado then intensified again as it entered Choctaw County and passed south of the town of Weir. Here a dairy complex was heavily damaged. A well-constructed milking parlor was totally destroyed with all exterior walls collapsed or destroyed. A large 9000 pound trailer was picked up and flipped onto the top of a farm building. Several large wood and metal livestock buildings were totally destroyed. A grain silo was also destroyed. Nearly 300 head of cattle were injured with 10 fatal. After the tornado passed this point, it did not encounter any additional structures, but a path of tree damage continued for several miles before the tornado dissipated near Choctaw Lake. The total path length across Attala and Choctaw counties was 24 miles with a maximum rating of EF3. Maximum winds were around 145 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The last time a tornado occurred in January in Wisconsin was on the 24th in 1967 in Green and Rock Counties (25-mile track).  On January 7th, a low pressure moved northeast through western Wisconsin, allowing a warm front to push through southern Wisconsin.  Temperatures rose into the lower to mid 60s over southeast Wisconsin with surface dewpoints peaking in the mid to upper 50s, resulting in moderate amounts of instablity.  Strong, veering winds from the surface to the jet stream level generated sufficient wind shear that supported rotating updrafts in scattered supercell thunderstorms over southeast Wisconsin.  A supercell thunderstorm, that had spun up a tornado in northeastern Illinois previously, then crossed the state line into south-central Walworth County (southeast of the city of Walworth) where it intesified and eventually spun up a tornado near Pell Lake that traveled into western Kenosha County.  Another supercell spun up a tornado over the northern reaches of the city of Kensoha.  Other scattered thunderstorms on this day across south-central and southeast Wisconsin dumped large hail up to 3/4 inch in diameter.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado in western Kenosha County was a continuation of the tornado that spun up 2.27 mils NE of Pell Lake in southeastern Walworth County.  It crossed into Kenosha County about 0.4 mile north of where CTH U in Walworth County crosses the county line and becomes CTH F in Walworth County.  The tornado continued northeast to just east of the intersection of STH 50 and CTH O, crossed STH 83 just north of 51st Street just north of New Munster Creek, passed through the Village of Wheatland, turned more east and crossed 308th Ave. just north of Peterson Creek, and then dissipated near a pond between CTH PH and 41st Street (Town Rd).  Fifteen people in the Civil Town of Wheatland sustained minor injuries.  Also in the Civil Town of Wheatland, 7 homes were affected, 25 sustained minor damage, 27 had major damage, and 25 were destroyed.  In the Civil Town of Brighton, 10 homes were affected, 3 had minor damage, 3 had major damage, and 4 were destroyed.  About 160 people were homeless due to residential damage.  This tornado traveled over frozen ponds and creeks, as well as snow piles leftover from recent snowmelt.  Average path width was about 100 yards.  The wind speed was estimated at 150 to 160 mph (DI 2 - FR12, DOD 8).  For a couple homes, the visual damage suggested an EF4 rating, however insufficient anchoring allowed these structures to fail at a lower wind speed.  Additionally, other nearby damage indicators didn't support an EF4 rating.  The specific starting location in Kenosha County was 42.556342,-88.30533, and the ending location was 42.60061,-88.13524.  For plotting purposes, here are a couple mid-point locations of this tornadoe's path: crossing of STH 83 - 42.59297, -88.22230, and the crossing of CTH B - 42.59756, -88.15928.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 13.71M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Two events impacted the region in a span of 3 days which produced several tornadoes, large hail and wind damage across the area. ||On January 10th a vigorous storm system developed over the southern portions of the Midwest and moved northeast towards the Ohio valley. A strong cold front swept across the area during the late morning into the afternoon hours and strong to severe thunderstorms developed out ahead of it. All of the ingredients for tornadic development came into place as warm Gulf moisture pushed northward into the area out ahead of the front. The thunderstorms developed in eastern Louisiana and quickly moved across central Mississippi during the late morning and afternoon hours. As the storms progressed eastward, good instability combined with very strong wind shear for supercell development east of the Mississippi River, with the storms reaching maximum intensity along and east of the interstate 55 corridor.||By far, the most damage was produced by a single supercell thunderstorm that moved from north of Vicksburg through north central and northeast Mississippi during the late morning and early afternoon hours. This single storm produced three strong tornadoes, all of which were rated as EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita tornado damage scale. The most significant damage occurred in Caledonia in Lowndes County, where a school gymnasium was destroyed along with a number of school buses and vehicles in the area.||A second supercell that organized near the Mississippi River in southwest Mississippi before midday tracked from Claiborne County, through the northern Jackson Metropolitan Area, and finally into Noxubee county in northeast Mississippi by mid afternoon. This storm was responsible for 5 different tornado touchdowns along its path, as well as many reports of high winds and hail.||The rest of the area saw a broken line of storms and other supercells ahead of the line. A mix of damaging winds and hail were reported through the rest of the afternoon before the system exited the area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado started with a narrow path of scattered downed trees near Shady Lane Road. The damage intensified as it approached Highway 17. Here tree damage became much more intense with hundreds of trees snapped and uprooted. One home had a portion of its roof ripped off. The tornado intensified and reached its maximum intensity and width between Highway 17 and U.S. Highway 51. Hundreds of trees were snapped and uprooted, some of them hardwoods that were snapped off except for a few large limbs and partially debarked. Several mobile homes were obliterated and two homes of wood frame and concrete block construction had nearly all of the outer walls collapsed along with total roof removal. Large missiles were generated, including a pickup truck that was thrown nearly 150 yards. On the east side of U.S. Highway 51, three high tension steel power poles were snapped off near the base. As the tornado continued east-northeast and moved into Attala County, the path narrowed and damage became limited to tree damage before dissipation just inside the Attala County line. The total path length across both Holmes and Attala Counties was 10 miles with a EF3 Enhanced Fujita Scale rating.

In addition, two tornadoes, one an EF3, developed along the stronger part of the line as it moved through Carroll county before daybreak causing extensive damage along their paths.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia and the Carrollton County Emergency Management Director confirmed that yet another tornado touched down in eastern Carroll county spawned by the same squall line of thunderstorms that just a few minutes earlier had resulted in an EF3 tornado in western Carroll county.  This tornado was rated an EF1, touching down three miles east of Carrollton and tracking to a point five miles east of Carrollton.  The path length was two miles long with a maximum path width of 100 yards.  Maximum wind speeds with the tornado were estimated at 90 mph.  A total of 24 structures sustained minor damage.  The majority of the damage was in the form of roof and siding damage to homes.  Numerous trees and power lines were also blown down along this tornado track as well.  A man was injured when a tree limb went through his automobile and impaled his body.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Damage was also noted to another farmstead where a grain bin was destroyed, as were a center pivot and several power poles. The tornado then entered Chapman on the southwest side. It was reported that 70 homes were completely destroyed, and 215 damaged.  In all, three-quarters of the buildings in town sustained damage. Two churches were demolished.

Trees across town were twisted and nearly stripped of their leaves and branches. For the most part, the downtown business section received only minor damage. Once outside the town, another farmstead was hit which damaged trees and outbuildings before lifting to the northeast of town. Debris from the town was littered for several miles east of the town. Dozens of individuals sustained minor injuries.  Three were critically injured.  One death was reported when a tree was blown onto a woman who had just put her daughter into the carseat of her vehicle.

The tornado tracked east-southeastward, roughly between the railroad tracks and US-78 towards the city center. There was significant roof damage to several buildings along Highway 78 from Leeds City Park in the downtown area, windows were blown out of several businesses, buildings were partially de-roofed, and the brick facade of one building was collapsed.

The tornado traveled a path length of seven to eight miles and had a maximum path width of 100 yards.  Maximum wind speeds were estimated at 140 mph.

A bowing line of thunderstorms was the culprit with the main axis of severe weather and damage having occurred within the I-20 corridor from northeast Louisiana to the Jackson Metro to east-central Mississippi around Meridian. Several extensive swaths of significant wind damage occurred, where winds were estimated at 80 mph or greater. Overall, several thousand trees were snapped and uprooted with several dozen homes damaged by downed trees. The strongest tornado occurred in the Jackson Metro area as it moved across Northeast Jackson and into the Reservoir area of Northwest Rankin County. Additionally, the significant wind damage was focused across portions of Vicksburg, Bolton, Jackson, the Reservoir area of Rankin County, the Hillsboro area in Scott County, northern Newton County and the northern half of Lauderdale County. Aside from the tornadoes, this was one of the most significant wind events to impact the Jackson Metro area as well as the City of Vicksburg. Nearly everyone described this event as being worse than Hurricane Katrina for central Mississippi.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The damage started with snapped trees, power lines and power poles across Livingston and County Line Roads and Watkins Drive. The tornado moved east-southeast, crossing Interstate 220 and downing numerous large trees, some on homes, as it moved through residential areas off Hanging Moss Road. Most of the damage in this area was EF-1 in nature with maximum winds between 90 and 105 mph. The damage became somewhat more intense as it moved through the Tougaloo area, with dozens of large trees snapped and uprooted, many on homes, causing serious damage. The tornado crossed State Street, and then crossed Interstate 55 where it caused roof damage to two hotels, and damaged a car dealership, snapping light poles, blowing the windows out of dozens of cars, and causing roof and awning damage. It also damaged the roof of a large medical building. As the tornado crossed Ridgewood Road, it blew out the back wall of a large restaurant building, and continued damaging roofs of buildings and knocking down numerous trees. The damage in the Interstate 55 area was rated as EF-1 with maximum winds between 95 and 105 mph.||Once the tornado crossed Ridgewood Road, it moved back into residential areas of northeast Jackson. The tornado reached its maximum intensity as it approached and crossed Old Canton Road. Hundreds of large trees were snapped and uprooted in these areas, causing major damage to numerous homes. On the east side of Old Canton, it caused extensive roof and facade damage to several commercial buildings, blew the walls out of the second story of a large warehouse type building, and caused extensive damage to the roofs of apartment complex buildings and a couple of residential homes. This area along the path from just west of Pear Orchard Road to the area on the east side of Old Canton Road was the maximum rated damage at EF-2 with maximum estimated winds of 115 mph.||While not accessible via ground survey, it is assumed based on radar data that the tornado continued on the ground across the Pearl River. Damage was again observed in northwest Rankin County in the subdivisions off of Old Fannin Road. Numerous trees were downed, a number on houses, and many homes had shingle damage. The most intense damage was where the tornado crossed Old Fannin Road in the Avalon and Barnett Bend subdivisions. Numerous large trees were snapped and uprooted, several causing major damage to some homes, and power poles were snapped off. Maximum winds here were estimated to be up to 105 mph, which is at the high end of EF-1 on the Enhanced Fujita scale.||Damage was somewhat less as it moved through the subdivisions east of Hugh Ward Parkway, but intensified again as it moved along Manship Road and into Mill Creek subdivision. A number of large trees were snapped and uprooted in these areas. The tornado crossed Lakeland Drive, continuing to down trees, and moved across the Northwest Rankin Attendance Center complex, blowing down trees, a fence at the baseball field, and blowing out an awning. The tornado crossed Vine Drive and caused extensive shingle and roof damage to a number of apartment buildings. The tornado dissipated shortly after this damage, causing sporadic tree damage at the edge of Castlewoods subdivision. Maximum winds in the area from Hugh Ward Parkway to prior to dissipation were estimated to generally be between 90 and 100 mph, which is EF-1 on the Enhanced Fujita scale.||Total path length was 14 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Ahead of the system, breezy southerly winds provided well above normal temperatures and abundant moisture. Warmth and moisture destabilized the atmosphere and fueled developing thunderstorms. A cold front moved across the state causing numerous severe storms and several tornadoes. One of the tornadoes tracked from Yell County to Sharp County, staying on the ground for 121.84 miles. This track length set a record for the longest tornado path ever recorded in Arkansas. The continuous track was confirmed by two National Weather Service meteorologists who flew the track with the Civil Air Patrol. The final track was based on ground surveys, the Civil Air Patrol flight, and an aerial mapping flight performed for the Arkansas Forestry Commission.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado moved from Conway County, northeast of Cleveland, into Van Buren County, south-southeast of Beverage Town.  A Red Cross survey indicated that 41 houses were destroyed, 26 suffered major damage, 29 had minor damage, and 30 others were affected.  In addition, 21 mobile homes were destroyed, 4 suffered major damage, 2 had minor damage, and one other was affected.  A boat factory was destroyed, and a church and a number of businesses were damaged.  Three fatalities occurred:  One in a house 3.2 miles south-southwest of Clinton, one at the boat factory in Clinton, and one in a mobile home 2.5 miles west of Shirley.

Low pressure approached from the west, along with a cold front so that the triple point was near the western Iowa, eastern Nebraska area by late afternoon.  Thunderstorms erupted quickly during the late afternoon and evening hours in the unstable airmass.  By evening, the low level jet was in the 40 to 60 kt range, feeding moisture into the state and pushing precipitable water values to around 200% of normal, in the 1.5 to 1.8 inch range.  MUCAPE reached 3000 to 3500 J/kg over western Iowa, with lifted indices in the -6 to -10 C. range.  The freezing level was quite high, limiting the hail size somewhat with this event, at 14,300 feet.  The available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was in the 300 to 500 J/kg range.  The DCAPE was between 800 and 1000 J/kg.  The environment was highly sheared with 50 to 65 kts of shear available during the event.  The LCL was also quite low, in the 750 to 1250 meter range.  Thunderstorms erupted over western Iowa stretching into north central Iowa first.  It did not take long for the storms to become severe with hail and high winds.  Most of the hail reported was in the pea to marble size, with the larger stones in the nickel to quarter size range.  The primary mode of severe weather was high winds and several tornadoes.  The secondary, but significant threat, was heavy rainfall.  A band of 3 to 5 inches of rain fell between U.S. Highway 30 and U.S. Highway 20 during the event.  The heaviest rainfall total was in Greene County at Jefferson, with 5.90 inches.  Tornadoes began to touch down in western Iowa in Crawford County with two brief touchdowns.  One was west of Dow City, causing roof and shingle damage to a farmhouse there.  The next was east of Denison where a barn roof was removed and a trailer house was destroyed.  A tornado in Carroll County caused damage to 3 farmsteads southeast of Templeton.  A machine shed was completely destroyed and numerous other buildings sustained damage.  Trees also had substantial damage. Two tornadoes touched down in Calhoun County.  One near Farnhamville, tore the roof off of a home and downed power lines.  The second caused damage to trees, outbuildings, and power lines on four farmsteads.  Farther south, a brief touchdown was reported in Dallas County in open fields west of Minburn.  Another tornado touched down in Dallas County later on, west of Adel, and was on the ground for about 4 miles.  A more substantial tornado touched down near Murray in Clarke County with one reported on the ground for about 9 miles.  As the storms moved east, another tornado was on the ground for over 10 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The most significant tornado occurred in Marion and Mahaska Counties where an EF2 tornado was on the ground for about 18 miles.  Several homes were damaged along its path, two mobile homes were destroyed, and considerable damage was done to trees in the area.  Up to 10 people were injured with this tornado, mainly in Attica.  The official damage count from this tornado included 5 homes destroyed, 15 with major damage, and another 25 with minor damage.  Many of the storms produced high winds with several reports of winds in the 65 to 75 MPH range.  Considerable tree damage was reported and some structural damage, mainly outbuildings and shingle damage.  Two cars were blown off of the road east of Manning by the high winds.  Building debris was blown onto Highway D60 near Gowrie, causing a brief closure.  High winds in Butler County blew down a machine shed and barn southwest of Aplington, very near to where an EF5 tornado struck just days before.  Extensive damage was done to a farmstead there with some damage done to the house itself as well.  Lightning struck a man in Carroll.  The lightning bolt hit his driveway, blowing out a chunk of concrete out of the driveway and also injured the man.  He was taken to hospital, treated, and released with minor injuries.  Flooding became a significant issue after the heavy rainfall of the previous few days.  Extensive river flooding occurred across the central third of the state.

A supercell thunderstorm developed across north central Alabama and tracked southeast into northwest Georgia and eventually across downtown Atlanta, spawning an EF2 tornado that tracked right through the heart of downtown Atlanta.  This was the first recorded incident of a tornado touchdown in downtown Atlanta.  The tornado wreaked havoc on the downtown streets as it tracked from the Vine City neighborhood on the west, across the I-75/85 corridor, through the Cotton Mill Lofts, and into extreme western DeKalb county before weakening.  One death was reported and dozens were injured as they were trapped in downtown buildings amidst debris.  Damage was in the millions.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A ground and aerial survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia in cooperation with the Atlanta Police Department, confirmed that an EF2 tornado tracked through the heart of the city of Atlanta causing millions of dollars of damage to buildings, including several high rise business and/or hotel buildings, within the downtown Atlanta area.  The tornado also resulted in one death and 30 non-life threatening injuries.  The death occurred on Decatur Street across from the Martin Luther King MARTA station.||The tornado first touched down near the intersection of Simpson and Burbank Streets in the Vine City neighborhood just west of downtown Atlanta.  The tornado then tracked near due east over the center of the Georgia World Congress Center, about 100 yards north of the Georgia Dome, which was concurrently hosting an SEC basketball conference, across the CNN Omni Hotel Complex and the Phillips Arena, where an NBA basketball game was underway, across the Equitable Bank tower, across the Interstate 75/85 Downtown Connector at the Edgewood Exit, and then into the Cotton Mill Lofts across the Oakland Cemetery located near the Fulton/DeKalb county line.  The tornado then weakened, but continued into extreme western DeKalb county before finally lifting for good.||The tornado had a total path length of six miles, five of which fell within Fulton county, and a maximum path width of 200 yards.  Maximum wind speeds were estimated at 130 mph, which is a high end EF2.  The tornado had a path width of 100 yards as it moved across the Georgia World Congress Center and CNN Omni Hotel complex and was ranked an EF1 at that point.||At least 50 homes were damaged by the tornado, as were several multi-story towers and commercial buildings near and east of Centennial Olympic Park.  Windows were blown out of several of these high rise tower buildings at multiple heights.  Damage in residential and industrial areas ranged from roofing materials blown from homes and businesses to trees falling on structures and vehicles.  The Cotton Mill Lofts experienced some of the most significant damage with the roof blown off and exterior walls on the top or fourth floors blown inward.  Two sections of the fourth flour collapsed all the way into the basement of the building, trapping several people.  Most of the injuries observed were associated with this damage.||Damaged buildings and structures in the downtown Atlanta area included two Hermes 65-foot tall light towers at Centennial Olympic Park, the CNN Center/Omni Hotel, Ebenezer Baptist Church, Equitable Bank Building, Georgia-Pacific Building, Georgia World Congress Center, Grady Hospital, Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum, Martin Luther King Center, Oakland Cemetery, SunTrust Building, Tabernacle, Ted's Montana Grill, Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel, and Walton Building Barbershop.||In addition to the damage reports, a wind gust of 83 mph was measured at Atlanta Fire Station No. 13 at 447 Flat Shoals Road Southeast in Atlanta, and a wind gust of 65 mph was measured at Atlanta Fire Station No. 4 at 309 Edgewood Drive in Atlanta.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Although the atmosphere was summer like in the lower elevations, the upper levels were more typical of April.  A strong upper level low pressure area lifted northeast out of the southern Rockies with a negatively tilted trough of low pressure lifting northeast across the central U.S.  An intense low pressure area developed over northern Kansas and lifted north into southeast North Dakota by the morning of the 6th, with a central Pressure of 984 mb.  During the day on the 5th, the atmosphere was capped with the freezing level rising to 15,600 feet by the evening hours over central Iowa.  A warm front lifted north across Iowa, with temperatures warming into the mid 80s to the south of the front with dewpoint readings in the low 70s.  It became quite unstable by evening with MUCAPE between 2500 and 3000 J/kg and lifted indices in the -5 to -9 C. range.  Considerable shear was available with the effective shear between 40 and 65 kts by evening.  Downdraft CAPE was between 800 and 1400 J/kg across the CWA, with 400 to 500 J/kg of CAPE available in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere.  The airmass became very moist by evening with 1.6 to 1.9 inches of precipitable water available by evening.  The LCL fall to between 750 and 1250 meters.  Thunderstorms erupted to the southwest of Iowa in central Kansas, along the dry line there.  The storms raced northeast into Iowa by sunset.  In spite of the dynamics that were in place, the amount of severe weather was relatively limited.  Hail was limited by the high freezing level and lack of supercellular development.  Several of the storms produced small hail and a few produced high winds.  There were several reports of brief tornado touchdowns, but little in the way of damage was reported for the most part.  The first tornado touched down in Cass County and was only on the ground briefly.  Another tornado touched down in Union County.  The tornado took the roof off of an outbuilding and knocked down some power lines.  The strongest tornado was on the ground for over 18 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The tornado track was over open country for the most part and damaged outbuildings and one house.  Three other tornadoes touched down in Jasper County, causing some moderate damage.  The most significant feature with this event was the flash flooding.  Soil conditions across the state were very saturated.  Any significant rainfall resulted in flash flooding.  A narrow band of heavier rainfall stretched from south central into central Iowa.  Flash flooding occurred in the Des Moines metro area as the airport recorded 4.15 inches of rainfall for the day, with about 3 inches falling in two hours.  Reports of severe street flooding were received with numerous reports of manhole covers being blown off.  During the event, high winds occurred over the far northwest part of the CWA as the surface low intensified rapidly and the gradient tightened.  A window was blown out in Pocahontas County, with tree and power line damage done in Emmet County.  A barn was also damaged near Gruver in Emmet County by the high wind.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Newly built machine shed destroyed with roof off of a house.

The stationary front provided the focus for two rounds of showers and thunderstorms, one early in the morning on the 10th and another in the afternoon.  The activity tracked east-southeast with the upper flow aloft, mainly across north Georgia during the early morning and across central Georgia during the afternoon.  An isolated strong supercell also tracked across the southern part of central Georgia during the evening.  After a lull of convective activity for about four hours, intense multicell thunderstorms tracked into the area from Alabama after midnight and before dawn on the 11th.  As these thunderstorms tracked across west central and central Georgia, 15 tornadoes were identified by subsequent surveys making this the most significant tornado outbreak to affect the area since the Katrina-associated tornadoes on August 29, 2005.  Millions of dollars of property damage were reported as many homes were destroyed from these tornadoes from the western and southern suburbs of Atlanta southeastward across Macon, Dublin, and other counties in east central and southeast Georgia.  Many of these counties were eligible for disaster assistance from the federal government.||In addition to the tornadoes and thunderstorm winds that caused extensive damage in dozens of counties across north and central Georgia during the early morning hours of May 11th, strong gradient winds developed on the back side of the strong cold front that moved through the area as low pressure intensified across the mid-Atlantic region.

Maximum winds within the tornado were estimated to be 130 mph and the maximum path width was determined to be up to 1/2 mile wide.  As the tornado touched down northwest of Kite, a mobile home was rolled and several other homes and vehicles were damaged along U.S. Highway 221 north of Kite.  The most significant damage occurred about three miles north of Kite, along Minton Chapel Road, where a mobile home was completely destroyed and the debris thrown up to 50 feet away.  Three injuries were reported as a result of the destruction of this mobile home.  An additional indirect injury occurred later when a tree fell on an individual during debris clean up.  A well constructed metal building in the same general area sustained substantial wall, frame, and column anchor failures.  A number of trees and several power lines were downed along the path of the tornado as well.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Meanwhile...a vigorous short wave aloft was approaching the area from the southern plains.  The stationary front provided the focus for two rounds of showers and thunderstorms, one early in the morning on the 10th and another in the afternoon.  The activity tracked east-southeast with the upper flow aloft, mainly across north Georgia during the early morning and across central Georgia during the afternoon.  An isolated strong supercell also tracked across the southern part of central Georgia during the evening.  After a lull of convective activity for about four hours, intense multicell thunderstorms tracked into the area from Alabama after midnight and before dawn on the 11th.  As these thunderstorms tracked across west central and central Georgia, 15 tornadoes were identified by subsequent surveys making this the most significant tornado outbreak to affect the area since the Katrina-associated tornadoes on August 29, 2005.  Millions of dollars of property damage were reported as many homes were destroyed from these tornadoes from the western and southern suburbs of Atlanta southeastward across Macon, Dublin, and other counties in east central and southeast Georgia.  Many of these counties were eligible for disaster assistance from the federal government.||In addition to the tornadoes and thunderstorm winds that caused extensive damage in dozens of counties across north and central Georgia during the early morning hours of May 11th, strong gradient winds developed on the back side of the strong cold front that moved through the area as low pressure intensified across the mid-Atlantic region.  The strong winds combined with wet ground resulted in dozens of trees being blown down in some north Georgia counties.  There were also two deaths as a result of downed trees in Barrow and Gwinnett county, all non-thunderstorm-related winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia confirmed that the EF1 tornado, that initially touched down in extreme northern Laurens just west-southwest of Tuckers Crossroads, continued on an eastward track into Johnson county, lifting a little less than one mile northeast of Wrightsville.

Meanwhile...a vigorous short wave aloft was approaching the area from the southern plains.  The stationary front provided the focus for two rounds of showers and thunderstorms, one early in the morning on the 10th and another in the afternoon.  The activity tracked east-southeast with the upper flow aloft, mainly across north Georgia during the early morning and across central Georgia during the afternoon.  An isolated strong supercell also tracked across the southern part of central Georgia during the evening.  After a lull of convective activity for about four hours, intense multicell thunderstorms tracked into the area from Alabama after midnight and before dawn on the 11th.  As these thunderstorms tracked across west central and central Georgia, 15 tornadoes were identified by subsequent surveys making this the most significant tornado outbreak to affect the area since the Katrina-associated tornadoes on August 29, 2005.  Millions of dollars of property damage were reported as many homes were destroyed from these tornadoes from the western and southern suburbs of Atlanta southeastward across Macon, Dublin, and other counties in east central and southeast Georgia.  Many of these counties were eligible for disaster assistance from the federal government.||In addition to the tornadoes and thunderstorm winds that caused extensive damage in dozens of counties across north and central Georgia during the early morning hours of May 11th, strong gradient winds developed on the back side of the strong cold front that moved through the area as low pressure intensified across the mid-Atlantic region.  The strong winds combined with wet ground resulted in dozens of trees being blown down in some north Georgia counties.  There were also two deaths as a result of downed trees in Barrow and Gwinnett county, all non-thunderstorm-related winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia confirmed that an EF2 tornado touched down in far northern Laurens county, just south of the Wilkinson county line.  The tornado initially touched down as an EF0 tornado near the intersection of Old Macon Road and Oscar Wynn Road.  The tornado quickly intensified to an EF2 tornado as it tracked almost due eastward and crossed U.S. Highway 441 at the 2700 block, about seven miles northwest of Dublin, or near the intersection of U.S. Highway 441 and Evergreen Road.  Here, a double-wide mobile home was destroyed and the occupants, a man and woman in their early 50s were both killed.  Their two grandchildren sustained non-life threatening injuries.  Another home along Evergreen Road was also destroyed as the EF2 tornado continued on its eastward track.  The tornado continued eastward and weakened back to an EF0 as it crossed the Oconee River.  The tornado then once again strengthened to an EF2 as it crossed Buckeye Road in the 2100 block, approximaltely four miles north-northeast of East Dublin.  EF2 tornado damage was noted to a home at 2185 Buckeye Road and EF1 tornado damage to another home at 1533 Buckeye Road.  In between the destruction to the homes on Evergreen Road and those on Buckeye Road, sporadic tree and power line damage was observed, mostly consistent with an EF0 intensity rating.  The tornado path length was about 15 miles.  A maximum path width of 250 yards was observed at the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 441 at Evergreen Road.||All together this tornado resulted in the destruction of two mobile homes, major damage to six other site built homes, some shifted off their foundations, one home with a missing roof, and many other homes with minor roof or siding damage.  Numerous sheds and outbuildings were also destroyed.  Several dozen trees were either uprooted or snapped off along the path of the tornado, along with several power lines.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.40M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The Tornado beginning and end times are based on radar data combined with credible ground truth reports. ||The Tornado formed at 952 am, approximately 3 miles northwest of Darien, Georgia and tracked east about 11 miles before dissipating at 1007 am as a water spout in Doboy Sound. ||The Tornado formed in a wooded area about a half mile west of Route 251 where numerous trees were snapped off. The Tornado strengthened rapidly as it approached and moved across Route 251.||The Tornado struck a Marine Sales and Services Business located on the east side of Route 251. The bolts for all but one of the anchored metal support beams for the metal building were snapped off just above the concrete slab. With the exception of the one metal support beam that was bent to the ground, the slab was wiped clean. Approximately 50 boats were tossed around and destroyed, with one 18 foot 4000 pound boast carried about 650 yards into some trees. A 32 foot 8000 pound boat was carried about 130 yards onto the top of the Gateway Behavioral Services Building. A vehicle that was parked in the parking lot was carried in the air 150 yards. One 125 horsepower boat motor weighing 300 to 350 pounds was carried 250 yards and deposited into the roof of a building. In addition, one of the boats had yet to be accounted for at the time the survey was conducted. Several other vehicles near the business were rolled or tossed and severely damaged or destroyed. No one was in the building at the time the Tornado struck and damage to the building and all the boats were estimated to be 5 million dollars.||Approximately 100 yards to the south-southeast of the Marine Sales and Services Building, the McIntosh Emergency Medical Services Building was destroyed by the Tornado with damage to three ambulances and one fire truck. Many of the metal support beams from this facility were torn from the concrete slab or snapped off. This building was rated for 120 mph winds. No one was in this building at the time of the Tornado because they were out on a non weather related call.||The Gateway Behavioral Health and Services Building was totally destroyed. This metal framed building with brick exterior was located about 100 yards east-northeast of the McIntosh Emergency Medical Services Building and 130 yards east-southeast of the Marine Sales and Services Building. The roof of the Gateway Building collapsed along with many of the outer brick walls. Many of the large load bearing metal beams were bent or knocked down. Portions of the metal roof were carried a mile away onto Interstate 95. Some of the roofing material was found 11 miles away on Sapelo Island. Of the 12 people that were in the building when the Tornado hit, 9 were injured sustaining broken bones and or lacerations. Six vehicles around this building were damaged or destroyed and a metal light pole and several trees were snapped off in this area. ||Two other businesses in this area suffered damage including damage to satellite dishes and two overturned tractor trailers. Damage to the Marine Sales and Services Business and the Gateway Behavioral Health and Services Building indicated that EF-4 damage had occurred with winds estimated to be between 170 and 180 mph. ||After leaving this area the Tornado traveled east and weakened. The Tornado reached its maximum width of 700 yards as it crossed Interstate 95, and then decreased in size and was mainly from 200 to 500 yards wide during the remainder of the path. The Tornado damaged or destroyed four billboards along Interstate 95, produced mainly minor roof damage to several dozen homes mainly in the Ridgeville area, snapped off or uprooted thousands of trees, some of them falling on homes or vehicles, and damaged or destroyed numerous outbuildings. ||A resident of Ridgeville, Georgia whose home suffered minor damage in the Tornado, took shelter in a closet after seeing a National Weather Service Severe Weather Statement on the television mentioning that Ridgeville was in the path of the Tornado. ||The Tornado also damaged the Blue-N-Hall Marina and Fishing Dock. In this area, a large boat hoist along with 18 boats and several boat trailers were damaged or destroyed. Several power poles were also snapped off and several vehicles were damaged.

The tornado remained on the ground for approximately 16.7 miles; the first 14 miles of the track occurred in Lawrence County, tracking through the Aldridge Grove, Fairfield, Five Points, Midway, and Caddo communities.  The tornado exited Lawrence County about 3 miles south southeast of Caddo around 3:20 AM CST. ||The most significant damage occurred in two main areas. The first occurred just south of the Pinhook community, near the intersection of County Road 92 and 188. The second occurred north of Aldridge Grove near the intersection of County Road 94 and 183, where three fatalities occurred. Numerous homes received significant structural damage, including a 2300 square foot/2-story brick house that was nearly leveled off its foundation. Large trees, with diameters up to 4 feet, were completely snapped, with many uprooted.

While the number of observed tornadoes was low (4), the area experienced two EF-4 tornadoes, the first time the area has witnessed more than one devastating tornado on the same day since 1974.  ||This event was part of a large tornado outbreak which spanned both February 5th (Super Tuesday) and 6th (Wednesday).  A series of tornadic supercell thunderstorms swept across the Mid-South and Southeast states ahead of a potent cold front.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Representatives from the National Weather Service and the Lawrence County Emergency Management Agency conducted a storm survey of damage that occurred in Lawrence County, Alabama early in the morning of February 6, 2008.||The damage was determined to originate from a strong tornado, which at its peak had winds of approximately 170 MPH, giving it a rating of EF-4 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. Based on reports and an aerial survey conducted by the Lawrence County EMA, the tornado is believed to have originally touched down near the Pinhook community in south-central Lawrence County (just north of the Bankhead National Forest) around 3:02 AM CST. The tornado remained on the ground for approximately 16.7 miles; the first 14 miles of the track occurred in Lawrence County, tracking through the Aldridge Grove, Fairfield, Five Points, Midway, and Caddo communities.  The tornado exited Lawrence County about 3 miles south southeast of Caddo around 3:20 AM CST. ||The most significant damage occurred in two main areas. The first occurred just south of the Pinhook community, near the intersection of County Road 92 and 188. The second occurred north of Aldridge Grove near the intersection of County Road 94 and 183, where three fatalities occurred. Numerous homes received significant structural damage, including a 2300 square foot/2-story brick house that was nearly leveled off its foundation. Large trees, with diameters up to 4 feet, were completely snapped, with many uprooted. Fence posts embedded in concrete were ripped out of the ground and vaulted 50 to 100 feet in several different directions. A truck was thrown over a distance of more than 100 yards into an open field.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This caused surface low pressure to develop over northeast Kansas along a cold front that was crossing the plains.  This in turn caused the front to slow down as it moved into southeast Nebraska and southwest Iowa.  A small line of thunderstorms that had developed along the front moved ahead of it and encountered a strong low level jet.  The combination of the low level jet, and a warm front that extended east of the low, strengthened the line segment just to the southwest of Omaha and causing it to bow out.  In turn a few quick moving spin-up circulations and 2 tornadoes developed as the bow echo crossed the Omaha area.  Although these tornadoes hit in the middle of the night and caused significant damage in the Omaha area, there were no deaths or serious injuries with the storm.  The system also produced areas of heavy rain which caused some flash flooding and then eventual river flooding.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the continuation of tornado number 1 (of 2) to hit the Omaha metro area this night.  Tornado number 1 crossed over from Sarpy county near 144th and Harrison Streets before merging with tornado number 2 just east of 132nd and Westwood Lane.  From there the merged tornado continued northeast to near 114th and Shirley Streets.  Tornado number 1 traveled at about 50 mph in Douglas county.  Tornado number 1 produced EF2 damage in both Douglas and Sarpy counties.  Although tree and roof damage was noted along most of the track, the area hardest hit in Douglas county was around 137th and Y Streets.  A few homes had their roofs completely blown off in this area, while others had significant roof and siding damage.  The tornado then hit a Walmart, Sams Club and Home Depot causing damage to each of those businesses after it crossed L Street.||Tornado number 1 first set down just southeast of 232nd and West Angus Road about a mile west of Gretna in Sarpy county.  It traveled about 8 miles in Sarpy county before crossing into Douglas county.||The tornadoes spun up on the leading edge of a bow echo that gathered strength and raced through the Omaha metropolitan region.  OPPD reported that 13,800 customers lost power from the storm.  In total, more than 500 homeowners reported damage from the storm and according to FEMA, 7 homes were destroyed and 21 others sustained major damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A small line of thunderstorms that had developed along the front moved ahead of it and encountered a strong low level jet.  The combination of the low level jet, and a warm front that extended east of the low, strengthened the line segment just to the southwest of Omaha and causing it to bow out.  In turn a few quick moving spin-up circulations and 2 tornadoes developed as the bow echo crossed the Omaha area.  Although these tornadoes hit in the middle of the night and caused significant damage in the Omaha area, there were no deaths or serious injuries with the storm.  The system also produced areas of heavy rain which caused some flash flooding and then eventual river flooding.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the continuation of tornado number 1 (of 2) to hit the Omaha metro area this night.  Tornado number 1 crossed over from Sarpy county near 144th and Harrison Streets before merging with tornado number 2 just east of 132nd and Westwood Lane.  From there the merged tornado continued northeast to near 114th and Shirley Streets.  Tornado number 1 traveled at about 50 mph in Douglas county.  Tornado number 1 produced EF2 damage in both Douglas and Sarpy counties.  Although tree and roof damage was noted along most of the track, the area hardest hit in Douglas county was around 137th and Y Streets.  A few homes had their roofs completely blown off in this area, while others had significant roof and siding damage.  The tornado then hit a Walmart, Sams Club and Home Depot causing damage to each of those businesses after it crossed L Street.||Tornado number 1 first set down just southeast of 232nd and West Angus Road about a mile west of Gretna in Sarpy county.  It traveled about 8 miles in Sarpy county before crossing into Douglas county.||The tornadoes spun up on the leading edge of a bow echo that gathered strength and raced through the Omaha metropolitan region.  OPPD reported that 13,800 customers lost power from the storm.  In total, more than 500 homeowners reported damage from the storm and according to FEMA, 7 homes were destroyed and 21 others sustained major damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The Tornado dissipated about 1.5 miles east of Cobbtown, however occasional bouts of non-tornadic straight line winds were observed across portions of northeast Tattnall County and northern Evans County near Undine, Georgia. ||Maximum sustained winds were estimated between 140 and 150 mph with a maximum width of approximately 200 yards.

Maximized low level wind shear along a surface boundary over north central North Dakota, along with low lifted condensation levels, created a favorable environment for low level mesocyclones and the development of isolated tornadoes.||The end result was a tornadic supercellular thunderstorm developing near Lake Metigoshe. It tracked east-southeast through northeastern Bottineau County and across northern Rolette County, before exiting into Towner County (Grand Forks, North Dakota County Warning Area) later in the afternoon. A storm survey conducted the following day found tornado damage in the Belcourt and Rolla areas, with the heaviest damage observed on the north side of Rolla. There were injuries from the tornadoes, but there were no deaths. Estimated damage was around one and a half million dollars.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> By North Dakota standards this was a long lived tornado that covered many miles.||A National Weather Service storm damage survey was completed in Rolette County on July 8, the day following the event. The storm survey concluded that the total path length was 17.6 miles, with a maximum width of 250 yards. The worst damage corresponded to low end EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, with maximum estimated winds of 140 mph. ||Multiple tornado sightings were reported by local officials and residents along Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Highway number eight between 2:50 PM CDT and 3:10 PM CDT. The storm survey concluded that tree and structural damage along this corridor west and northwest of Belcourt corresponded to EF1 and EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, or wind speeds ranging from 90 to 130 mph, with a path width ranging from 50 to 75 yards. Greater damage was surveyed north and northeast of Belcourt. Along BIA Highway number seven, a tornado path width of 250 yards was observed with significant widespread tree damage, corresponding to an EF2 rating or winds of 115 to 130 mph. Northeast of Belcourt along BIA highway number five, a home sustained heavy damage and there was one injury. Here, a rating of EF2 was assigned, with estimated wind speeds up to 135 mph. Storm reports around the immediate Belcourt area indicate a time of approximately 3:15 PM CDT for tornado impact. Seventy structures in total were impacted in the Belcourt area with varying degrees of damage.||The tornadic storm continued east hitting the north side of the city of Rolla at approximately 3:30 PM CDT. Twelve homes were destroyed and 18 homes were damaged. The homes with the most significant structural damage corresponded to an EF3 rating. From this it was determined that the maximum wind speeds here were on the order of 140 mph. Two minor injuries were also reported in the Rolla area. The tornado continued east-southeast, hitting a farmstead east of Rolla which sustained structural and tree damage consistent with an EF2 tornado, or winds around 125 mph. The tornado then crossed US Highway 281 before pushing southeast into Towner County (See National Weather Service Grand Forks, North Dakota Storm Data from July 7, 2008).<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A surface low pressure area was developing in response to this synoptic pattern along the southeast U.S. coast.  Widespread showers and thunderstorms accompanied the system through Georgia during the morning hours, moving out of the region during the early afternoon.  However, additional scattered showers and thunderstorms developed during the evening hours in advance of the strong cold front.  As this occurred, a couple of these thunderstorms, albeit small, became severe.  One spawned an EF1 tornado in the Chapel Hill area of Douglas county, causing significant damage to a large grocery store and at least 50 homes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A storm damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia concluded that a tornado, with a maximum intensity of EF1, tracked nearly seven miles across eastern Douglas county.  Maximum path width was determined to be 100 yards and maximum wind speeds were estimated at 110 mph, near the upper end of the EF1 scale.  The tornado, which began as an EF0 tornado, touched down in the 4300 block of Hampton Mill Drive in Chapel Hill, or about 4 miles south-southeast of Douglasville.  Damage at this location was confined to minor roof damage and several snapped trees.  The tornado continued across Stratford Drive as an EF0 where several more trees were snapped or bent over and a fence was blown down.  The tornado then strengthened to an EF1 tornado as it crossed into a shopping center at the intersection of Bomar and Chapel Hill Roads.  A Kroger grocery store sustained considerable damage when an air conditioning unit was blown off the roof, causing considerable damage to the roof of the building.  An employee of the Kroger store was injured with a broken arm during the tornado. The tornado then continued as an EF1 into the Ashland Subdivision where numerous homes sustained minor roof damage and many trees were either uprooted or snapped.  A number of homes in this area also sustained broken windows.  A portion of the Kroger grocery store roof was found scattered about this neighborhood.  As the EF1 continued on its north-northeastward track from this area, a mobile home was destroyed when a large pine tree fell on the structure.  A number of large trees were also uprooted in the area.  A trampoline was found up in the trees.  The tornado than continued toward Ossabaw Court and Brookhollow, where winds associated with the tornado were estimated to have reached their maximum intensity of 110 mph.  Numerous trees were blown down, the north side of a home was destroyed, a garage was damaged, a chimney blown down, and several homes sustained roof damage.  As the tornado continued toward Warren and Pope Road, a shed was destroyed, several more large trees were uprooted, and shingles were blown off the roofs of several homes.  Debris throughout the area was scattered up to 200 yards from its origin.  The tornado continued on its north-northeastward track  and began to weaken back to an EF0 as it tracked across Georgia Highway 92 and into the southern portions of the Lithia Springs area.  A few large trees were blown down along Georgia Highway 92 just west of Bomar Road.  In the southern part of Lithia Springs, several homes on Annette Drive suffered minor roof damage, a fence was blown down, a basketball goal blown over, and several trees were uprooted.  The tornado ended near the intersection of Beaver Run Creek Road and Vulcan Drive, where several trees were down.||All together, one mobile home and one site-built home were destroyed, 10 homes sustained major damage, 52 sustained minor damage, 1 business had major damage, and 1 business had minor damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A surface low pressure area was developing in response to this synoptic pattern along the southeast U.S. coast.  Widespread showers and thunderstorms accompanied the system through Georgia during the morning hours, moving out of the region during the early afternoon.  However, additional scattered showers and thunderstorms developed during the evening hours in advance of the strong cold front.  As this occurred, a couple of these thunderstorms, albeit small, became severe.  One spawned an EF1 tornado in the Chapel Hill area of Douglas county, causing significant damage to a large grocery store and at least 50 homes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A storm damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia concluded that a tornado, with a maximum intensity of EF1, tracked nearly seven miles across eastern Douglas county.  Maximum path width was determined to be 100 yards and maximum wind speeds were estimated at 110 mph, near the upper end of the EF1 scale.  The tornado, which began as an EF0 tornado, touched down in the 4300 block of Hampton Mill Drive in Chapel Hill, or about 4 miles south-southeast of Douglasville.  Damage at this location was confined to minor roof damage and several snapped trees.  The tornado continued across Stratford Drive as an EF0 where several more trees were snapped or bent over and a fence was blown down.  The tornado then strengthened to an EF1 tornado as it crossed into a shopping center at the intersection of Bomar and Chapel Hill Roads.  A Kroger grocery store sustained considerable damage when an air conditioning unit was blown off the roof, causing considerable damage to the roof of the building.  An employee of the Kroger store was injured with a broken arm during the tornado. The tornado then continued as an EF1 into the Ashland Subdivision where numerous homes sustained minor roof damage and many trees were either uprooted or snapped.  A number of homes in this area also sustained broken windows.  A portion of the Kroger grocery store roof was found scattered about this neighborhood.  As the EF1 continued on its north-northeastward track from this area, a mobile home was destroyed when a large pine tree fell on the structure.  A number of large trees were also uprooted in the area.  A trampoline was found up in the trees.  The tornado than continued toward Ossabaw Court and Brookhollow, where winds associated with the tornado were estimated to have reached their maximum intensity of 110 mph.  Numerous trees were blown down, the north side of a home was destroyed, a garage was damaged, a chimney blown down, and several homes sustained roof damage.  As the tornado continued toward Warren and Pope Road, a shed was destroyed, several more large trees were uprooted, and shingles were blown off the roofs of several homes.  Debris throughout the area was scattered up to 200 yards from its origin.  The tornado continued on its north-northeastward track  and began to weaken back to an EF0 as it tracked across Georgia Highway 92 and into the southern portions of the Lithia Springs area.  A few large trees were blown down along Georgia Highway 92 just west of Bomar Road.  In the southern part of Lithia Springs, several homes on Annette Drive suffered minor roof damage, a fence was blown down, a basketball goal blown over, and several trees were uprooted.  The tornado ended near the intersection of Beaver Run Creek Road and Vulcan Drive, where several trees were down.||All together, one mobile home and one site-built home were destroyed, 10 homes sustained major damage, 52 sustained minor damage, 1 business had major damage, and 1 business had minor damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first storm brought rain to the lower elevations and gusty winds and very heavy snow to the mountains and deserts. Blizzard conditions forced the closure of mountain highways while heavy rain caused a debris flow in the Santiago Burn Area. Snowfall accumulations from this first storm measured 31 inches at Big Bear Lake, 30 inches at Running Springs, and 24 inches at Forest Falls. The second storm on the 17th was notable for its significant rains in the low deserts and heavy snowfall in the mountains and high deserts. Heavy rain caused significant flooding in the Tijauna River valley. Surface offshore pressure gradients and mid-level easterly flow brought dry air into the region, resulting in widespread evaporative cooling and snow levels down to the desert floor. The winter storm dumped 20 inches of snow in Pinon Hills, 18 inches of snow in Hesperia, Lucerne Valley, Palomar Mountain, and Julian, 16 inches of snow in Idyllwild, 14 inches in Victorville, and even 4 inches in Shelter Valley. Local snowfall amounts in excess of 2 feet occurred in the San Bernardino Mountains. Total snowfall accumulations at Big Bear Lake for the 5 day period ending on the 17th was an impressive 54 inches.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Significant flooding in the Tijuana River Valley resulted in the deaths of a Tijuana man and numerous ranch and farm animals. At least 21 people had to be rescued, including 6 by helicopter. Three men were taken to a hospital and treated for hypothermia. An estimated 70 horses were also rescued. Three horses drowned before they could be rescued and another horse was later euthanized due to a leg injury. Fifteen goats and an unknown number of dogs also died in the flood. One farmer lost $600,000 dollars worth of his crop while another lost $10,000 dollars worth of watermelons. The one human death occurred outside the forecast area in Tijuana, Mexico. The flash flood occurred when both the Tijuana River and a nearby flood control channel became dammed with with sediment, trash, and other debris.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This allowed a strong southerly flow to transport copious amounts of moisture from the deep south into the Midwest.  Several waves of low pressure moved along a nearly stationary frontal boundary that remained just south of the forecast area, across northern Arkansas and extreme southern Illinois. Several rounds of rain and thunderstorms brought locally heavy rainfall to much of the forecast area, with the greatest amounts confined along and south of Interstate 44 in Missouri and Interstate 70 in Illinois. Total rainfall ranged from less than an inch across portions of west central Illinois to almost 10 inches in southern Reynolds County, Missouri. The excessive rainfall led to flash flooding of low lying areas and major flooding on local rivers and creeks for the next week. Many people were affected by this event, with millions of dollars in damage recorded across the forecast area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Very heavy rain fell over Reynolds county beginning late on the 17th of March and throughout the day on the 18th. The co-operative observer in Ellington reported a storm total of 9.7 inches. Four inches of rain fell in Ellington through 8 am on the 18th, then another 2 inches fell between 8 am and 11 am on the 18th, with an additional 3.7 inches in the hours after that. This caused the creeks in the area to rise rapidly including Logan Creek which flows through the middle of Ellington.  The creek began to rise rapidly around 7 am, rising nearly 10 feet by noon. Around 8 am, an 81 year old man was trying to clear some flood debris from a bridge that goes over the creek next to his business and was possibly knocked into the flood waters by a camper trailer that had been washed away from its location.  He was pronounced dead at 830 am.  A number of homes and businesses were flooded in town and several propane tanks were floating in the flood waters. Numerous roads throughout Reynolds county were flooded due to the heavy rains.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 400.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Surface temperatures warmed into the 80s with dew point readings in the low to mid 70s.  A semi-stationary front extended northeast from the low, across northern Iowa during the afternoon into the evening hours.  The atmosphere became very unstable with MUCAPE in the 4500 to 5000 J/kg range by mid afternoon and lifted indices around -7 C.  The shear was quite high, between 40 and 70 kts.  Downdraft CAPW was between 1000 and 1300 J/kg with cape in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere around 400 J/kg.  The LCL was in the 750 to 1000 meter range, with the lowest over north central Iowa.  With the exception of one hail report of 3 inch diameter hail report in north central Iowa, hail size was somewhat limited by the freezing level of 15500 to 16500 feet.  A very strong transport of moisture took place on a 50 to 75 kt 850 mb jet.  Precipitable water values soared to 1.6 to 1.9 inches by evening.  During the initial phase of the severe event, high winds and hail were reported along the line of thunderstorms that formed from northern into west central Iowa.  There were four reports of tornadoes in Worth, Winnebago and Cerro Gordo Counties during the afternoon hours of the 7th.  This was with the initial round of storms.  One of the tornadoes in Winnebago County destroyed a hog confinement building containing 3500 hogs.  Several of them were killed and the remaining hogs needed to be taken to slaughter.  The event transitioned into a flooding event overnight, then tornadoes began again during the afternoon of the 8th.  A tornado touched down in Taylor County.  Windows were blown out of houses there and several trees were twisted and blown down around the house.  A pole shed was completely destroyed south of Ferguson in Marshall County.  A stronger tornado was on the ground north to northeast of Ottumwa.  A home lost a roof, with a wall of one room partially collapsed by the tornado.  Several trees were also downed around the home.  The event transitioned into a major Flood/Flash Flood event during the evening and early morning hours with many locations reporting 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and spotty amounts of around 5 inches in just a few hours time.  The line moved very little for a period of several hours.  During the predawn hours, the line became broad and weakened to generally below severe limits.  A new round of thunderstorms from Nebraska, which was the southwest part of the extensive line, moved into  west central and southwest Iowa.  The storm generally remained below severe levels for the most part, but they did produce very heavy rains.    Another line of thunderstorms formed/re-intensified along the frontal boundary by the early afternoon hours.  Initially, the storms produced strong winds and some small hail.  As they moved southeast, several reports of high winds to near 70 MPH and a few reports of tornadoes were received.  The most significant weather feature with this event was the heavy rainfall.  The antecedent soil conditions in Iowa were extremely wet, such that flash flooding was caused by rainfall of an inch or more in an hour, even in rural areas.  Heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches occurred in a broad swath extending from west central into north central, and parts of central and northeast Iowa.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding.  Eventually, the rain lead to major to record flooding along many of the rivers in the state.  At one point or another, about 40 of the DMX 51 counties in the CWA were under flash flood warning.  The situation was very serious over the north central and northeast counties.  A levy was breached in the Mason City area as the Winnebago River rose to 3 feet over the record stage.  The city was inundated by water.  The water treatment plant was under water and non operational, all power was lost to the power grid in the city.  The river cut a new channel and changed course into the downtown area.  In the New Hartford area, a dam broke on Beaver Creek, resulting in the water level rising 2 feet above the all-time record level.  High water along the mainstem Cedar River also caused communities to lose water.  Nashua lost water as the water plant became flooded.  Flooding along the Shell Rock River resulted in water supply loss in the town of Rockford.  There was one death that resulted from the flooding.  A 33 year old man died as he drove into flood waters in Interstate 35 at mile post 141 in Hamilton County.  A second death occurred in Wright County as a 50 year old male farmer near Galt was sucked into a culvert by flood waters as he checked the field tiles in his farm field.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Street flooding in Eagle Grove with some streets closed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Copious amounts of moisture were available that allowed repeated heavy rains.  Additionally, there was sufficient vertical wind shear to allow for the generation of supercell thunderstorms with rotating updrafts that led to seven tornadoes in this part of the state of Wisconsin.  The flooding rains constituted the 2nd round/punch of heavy rains that led to more widespread and severe flash flooding and record-setting river flooding (1st punch was Jun 7-9, 2008).||The axis of heavy rains on June 12th extended from Lafayette County northeast through Dane County to eastern Green Lake County and western Fond du Lac County.  Generally 4 to 6 inches fell in this area, with 1 to 4 inches elsewhere.  The generous rains in June at Milwuakee led to a montly total of 12.27 inches.  This easily broke the record for highest June rainfall total. The previous record was 10.13 inches, set in 1917, and also makes June, 2008, the wettest month ever at Milwaukee.||The Rock River crested at all-time record high levels at the following gauage sites:  Waupun (10.07' on 6/13), Horicon (10.29' on 6/17), Watertown (7.81' on 6/13), Jefferson (15.64' on 6/18), Ft. Atkinson (10.85' on 6/21), Newville (15.12' on 6/21), Indianford (18.33' on 6/21), and Afton (13.51' on 6/21).  Likewise, the Crawfish River set a new all-time high crest of 13.59' on 6/16 at Milford, and Beaver Dam Creek set a new record of 843.53' on 6/16 at Beaver Dam.  Other, new, all-time record high crests include 4.47' on 6/9 on the Bark River at Rome, 4.95' on 6/13 on the Mukwonago River at Mukwonago, 11.41' on 6/8 on Oak Creek in South Milwaukee, 13.93' on 6/13 on the Milwaukee River near Cedarburg, 13.54' on 6/15 on the Fox River at Burlington, and 15.18' on 6/15 on the Fox River at New Munster.||High water levels generaged major road blocks, for various periods, on Interstate 94 in Jefferson and Waukesha Counties, on Interstate 894 in Milwaukee, and on Interstate 39/90/94 in Columbia County near Portage.

In fact, these storms exhibited very high rainfall rates, which led to 1 to 2 inch rainfall amounts in an hour. As the storms congealed into a larger scale line of thunderstorms, they continued to move over the same areas, which led to significant flash flooding through the evening and overnight. ||On June 8, the warm front was lingering across the region, but a cold front approached out of the northern Plains. Showers and storms would redevelop during the day in the vicinity of the warm front, while a line of storms developed out ahead of the cold front, with these tracking across the region Sunday night. Again, copious amounts of moisture lead to periods of heavy rain. ||The heavy rainfall on June 8 enhanced the already dangerous flooding conditions across parts of northeast Iowa. Many roads were already closed from the June 7 rains due to water over the roadways, mudslides, or partial washouts. Conditions only worsened, leading to more road closures, sandbagging, and some evacuations.||While the rain was tapering off and moving east Sunday night, June 8, the rivers continued to rise, and some extremely quickly. Some rivers responded with a foot per hour rises, while others eventually exceeded their river gauges ability to record the river levels. These gauges were under water themselves! All-time record crests were set at a few locations, with top 5 records at many others.||Damage to infrastructure and crops was preliminarily estimated at 70 to 80 million dollars. As a result, Mitchell, Floyd, Howard, Chickasaw, Winneshiek, Fayette, Allamakee and Clayton Counties were all declared federal disaster areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Excessive rainfall caused fairly widespread flash flooding across the county. Steep terrain enhanced the flash flood threat causing mud slides and damaged infrastructure. Numerous roads were washed out and bridges damaged. A mud slide at Camp Tahigwa Girl Scout camp near Dorchester trapped part of the staff, but no one was injured. In Dorchester, the Waterloo Creek flash flooded swamping several mobile homes or trailers and cars along Highway 76. Water swept through town very quickly trapping people on their cars and roof tops.

The flooding affected many municipalities island wide.  The torrential rainfall resulted in severe flooding to rivers, streams, and roads, causing sinkholes, land/mudslides, and structural collapses mainly across the southern half of the island.  Specifically, the heaviest rainfall, and most severe effects, occurred across the municipalities of Cabo Rojo, Guayama, Humacao, Patillas, Ponce, and Yabucoa, where in some locations, totals approaching 30 inches of rainfall fell in a three-day period, ending at 8 am Tuesday, September 23, 2008.The heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding were a direct result of a large tropical disturbance that moved slowly west across the island.  On occasion, tropical disturbances may develop into tropical depressions and, upon further intensification, get named by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) as a tropical storm and/or hurricane. While the National Weather Service (NWS) in San Juan and the NHC closely monitored the system for possible organization into a named storm, multiple reconnaissance flights flown through the disturbance revealed no closed, low-level, surface circulation, which was needed to satisfy the definition of a tropical depression.  It was not until 5 pm Thursday, September 25, 2008 when the system, located about 380 miles north northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico, was named Tropical Storm Kyle. The strongest effects of the tropical disturbance were first felt in Puerto Rico on Sunday, September 21, 2008.  The most intense rainfall occurred in the 24-hour period starting at 8 am Sunday, September 21, 2008 through 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008, with the highest rainfall rates occurring during the overnight hours from sunset on Sunday to sunrise on Monday.  The largest rainfall amounts for the 24-hour period ending 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008  were 22.03 inches in Patillas, 20.00 inches in Guayama, 16.00 inches in Cabo Rojo, 14.83 inches in Yabucoa, and 10.81 inches in Ponce.  For the combined three-day period, some of these numbers increase further with 29.83 inches in Patillas, 21.86 inches in Yabucoa, 20.52 inches in Ponce, and 17.82 inches in Cabo Rojo.  Lesser, but just as significant, amounts, ranging from 5-15 inches of rain, fell across much of the island.  The torrential rainfall seen across the island was immediately seen across the extensive river network in Puerto Rico.  Some rivers, including the Rio Gurabo, saw water levels rise in excess of 25 feet in less than 12 hours.  Parts of the island that were spared the worst of the rain include the northern and northwestern coast, were only moderate rain showers were experienced.  The total rainfall amounts recorded from this event are unique in that the 29.83 inches seen in Patillas exceeds the weekly total rainfall of 27.13 inches measured in Juana Diaz during the October 1985 flood event.  The 24-hour rainfall totals ending at 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008, which encompassed parts of the southeastern section of the island, including the municipalities of Patillas and Guayama, exceeded 200-year 24-hour rainfall totals.  Specifically for Patillas, the recorded rainfall amount approaches the 500-year 24-hour rainfall totals.  Along the southwestern section of the island, Cabo Rojo���s 24 hour rainfall also exceeded the 100-year return period. Across the southern municipalities of Puerto Rico, Ponce and Yauco���s 24-hour rainfall rates exceeded the 10-year 24-hour rainfall totals, Juana Diaz exceeded the 25-year rainfall totals, and Yabucoa, along the southeast coast, exceeded the 25-year rainfall totals. The resultant flooding had considerable effects on the local population. Six fatalities were reported, three direct deaths due to drowning, and 3 indirect heart attack deaths related to stress induced flooding. An estimated 630 people in the affected areas were evacuated to shelters. In addition to structural damage caused by the flood waters, agricultural damage was sustained by coffee, plantains, and other minor crops, damage was preliminarily estimated at 23 million. In response to the significant flooding, federal authorities issued a disaster declaration for portions of the island.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flooding was reported at Brisas del Prado, Olympic Ville, Palma Royale, La Estancia, in Las Piedras.

Low pressure approached from the west, along with a cold front so that the triple point was near the western Iowa, eastern Nebraska area by late afternoon.  Thunderstorms erupted quickly during the late afternoon and evening hours in the unstable airmass.  By evening, the low level jet was in the 40 to 60 kt range, feeding moisture into the state and pushing precipitable water values to around 200% of normal, in the 1.5 to 1.8 inch range.  MUCAPE reached 3000 to 3500 J/kg over western Iowa, with lifted indices in the -6 to -10 C. range.  The freezing level was quite high, limiting the hail size somewhat with this event, at 14,300 feet.  The available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere was in the 300 to 500 J/kg range.  The DCAPE was between 800 and 1000 J/kg.  The environment was highly sheared with 50 to 65 kts of shear available during the event.  The LCL was also quite low, in the 750 to 1250 meter range.  Thunderstorms erupted over western Iowa stretching into north central Iowa first.  It did not take long for the storms to become severe with hail and high winds.  Most of the hail reported was in the pea to marble size, with the larger stones in the nickel to quarter size range.  The primary mode of severe weather was high winds and several tornadoes.  The secondary, but significant threat, was heavy rainfall.  A band of 3 to 5 inches of rain fell between U.S. Highway 30 and U.S. Highway 20 during the event.  The heaviest rainfall total was in Greene County at Jefferson, with 5.90 inches.  Tornadoes began to touch down in western Iowa in Crawford County with two brief touchdowns.  One was west of Dow City, causing roof and shingle damage to a farmhouse there.  The next was east of Denison where a barn roof was removed and a trailer house was destroyed.  A tornado in Carroll County caused damage to 3 farmsteads southeast of Templeton.  A machine shed was completely destroyed and numerous other buildings sustained damage.  Trees also had substantial damage. Two tornadoes touched down in Calhoun County.  One near Farnhamville, tore the roof off of a home and downed power lines.  The second caused damage to trees, outbuildings, and power lines on four farmsteads.  Farther south, a brief touchdown was reported in Dallas County in open fields west of Minburn.  Another tornado touched down in Dallas County later on, west of Adel, and was on the ground for about 4 miles.  A more substantial tornado touched down near Murray in Clarke County with one reported on the ground for about 9 miles.  As the storms moved east, another tornado was on the ground for over 10 miles in Warren and Marion Counties.  The most significant tornado occurred in Marion and Mahaska Counties where an EF2 tornado was on the ground for about 18 miles.  Several homes were damaged along its path, two mobile homes were destroyed, and considerable damage was done to trees in the area.  Up to 10 people were injured with this tornado, mainly in Attica.  The official damage count from this tornado included 5 homes destroyed, 15 with major damage, and another 25 with minor damage.  Many of the storms produced high winds with several reports of winds in the 65 to 75 MPH range.  Considerable tree damage was reported and some structural damage, mainly outbuildings and shingle damage.  Two cars were blown off of the road east of Manning by the high winds.  Building debris was blown onto Highway D60 near Gowrie, causing a brief closure.  High winds in Butler County blew down a machine shed and barn southwest of Aplington, very near to where an EF5 tornado struck just days before.  Extensive damage was done to a farmstead there with some damage done to the house itself as well.  Lightning struck a man in Carroll.  The lightning bolt hit his driveway, blowing out a chunk of concrete out of the driveway and also injured the man.  He was taken to hospital, treated, and released with minor injuries.  Flooding became a significant issue after the heavy rainfall of the previous few days.  Extensive river flooding occurred across the central third of the state.  Record crests were recorded on the Iowa River at Marshalltown.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Exceptional updrafts evident within these storms and high reflectivities through a deep layer within the thunderstorms (70 dbz to nearly 50,000 ft)produced hail up to the size of softballs at several locations across the county warning area.  The stones caused the most damage on the southwest side of the city of Manhattan, where the airport, numerous businesses, and hundreds of vehicles were pummeled with the large stones. Residents noted that it was so dark under the storms, that they needed a flashlight to see. A newspaper interview noted that one resident reported that gravel was shooting ten feet in the air, driven by the large hail. Farm fields across portions of Franklin County also showed extensive damage. Small animals that were unable to seek shelter also fell victim to the hail stones.  One Manhattan resident reported dead rabbits, squirrels, owls, and quail in his neighborhood. ||The somewhat discrete storms congealed into a convective line as they pushed southeastward across the county warning area, and the primary severe weather threat became strong winds. Residents and law enforcement officers across portions of Douglas, Franklin, Anderson, and Jefferson Counties reported wind gusts in the 60 to 70 mile per hour range. Two individuals in Shawnee County measured wind gusts of 80 miles per hour. Power outages were reported across the city of Topeka, with some residents left without power through that evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A woman went out for a walk just before ten in the morning , right after the rain associated with severe thunderstorm ended.  She stopped in her yard to pick a weed. Meanwhile, a lightning bolt struck the house across the street, and was felt by her. The bolt left a hole in the roof of the home, and blew several shingles onto the ground.  The woman had an elevated blood pressure, and was taken to a local hospital.

This was pushing an equally unusually strong cold front for early August into the southeast U.S.  This front combined with a very warm humid air mass, partially a result of the lingering remnants of Hurricane Dolly, to result in the development of numerous strong to severe thunderstorms in far north Georgia during the mid to late afternoon hours.  Thunderstorms across north Georgia merged into a near solid arched band of thunderstorms which raced southward during the evening hours into the Atlanta metropolitan area.  Large hail and intense cloud-to-ground lightning accompanied the thunderstorms in north Georgia.  Leading outflow winds produced a wind gust of 71 mph at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport as the thunderstorms came through around 730 pm EDT.  The thunderstorms subsequently diminished as they pushed further south of the Atlanta area, but redeveloped once again into strong to severe thunderstorms during the late evening as the outflow boundary pushed into the Macon area and nearby counties.  Numerous reports of downed trees were received from many north and central Georgia counties as a result of these thunderstorms.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Cherokee County Emergency Management Director reported that an individual was struck by lightning seven miles southwest of Canton and sustained non life-threatening injuries.

High levels of moisture contributed to heavy downpours that resulted in flash flooding in Rhode Island and portions of Massachusetts.  All of this coupled with strong wind shear (turning of the winds with height) over southeast Massachusetts and Rhode Island provided the perfect environment for a tornado to form.  ||This particular tornado began as a waterspout over Narragansett Bay and traveled east-northeast reaching land over the southern portion of Warren, Rhode Island.  The tornado continued for 4.2 miles into Swansea, Massachusetts over a mostly continuous track.  Most of the damage sustained was to trees which fell on power lines and houses.

Several eyewitness accounts from climbers on Suicide and Tahquitz Rocks, as well as from people involved in the ongoing SAR mission, describe hailstones ranging in size from marbles to walnuts. A rescue helicopter was forced to abort a rescue attempt of the climbers and make an emergency landing after the thunderstorm moved into the area. One of the injured climbers suffered additional contusions from the hail while another person received cuts. Please note that the severe thunderstorm did not move into the area until nearly two hours after the initial (non-weather related) rock climbing accident.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
