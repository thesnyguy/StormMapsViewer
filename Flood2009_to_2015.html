Ahead of this low, unseasonably large amounts of moisture were drawn northward from the Gulf of Mexico. The approach of the low set off heavy rain and thunderstorms on the 23rd and 24th.

In a broad swath from southwest Arkansas through the central part of the state into northeast Arkansas, many places picked up 7 to 10 inches of rain.

Light snow fell across parts of northern and western Arkansas from late on the 24th into the early morning hours of Christmas Day. Most snowfall amounts were in the 1/2 to 1 inch range, with spotty totals up to 2 inches.

Arkansas Highway 89 was closed near Furlow. Fire departments used boats to rescue five residents on Grayhawk Circle, where water was about 5 feet deep on Christmas Eve morning. Along Arkansas Highway 236 West, water was 4 to 5 feet deep on the road and even deeper in the houses. The South Bend Fire Department responded to 38 calls for rescues from vehicles trapped in high water, and assisted six families who needed to leave flooded homes. One motorist suffered hypothermia before he was rescued from his car. Problem areas included Graham Road, Kerr Station Road, South Kerr Road, Gentry Lane, Rifle Lane, and Shotgun Lane. Arkansas Highway 31 was flooded from Beebe to Lonoke. U.S. Highway 70 was closed by flooding between Carlisle and Lonoke. In Carlisle, part of City Hall flooded. In Lonoke, a number of homes and the city shop were flooded. County roads throughout the county were damaged.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Numerous businesses and roads were affected by the high waters, with several drivers having to be rescued after driving into flooded streets. Creeks flowing off the Cumberland Plateau in northern Hamilton County also caused flooding in the Soddy Daisy areas, closing roads.

Major flooding was noted in many other areas of north and central Georgia, including the eastern suburbs of Atlanta, northwest Georgia, and parts of central Georgia.  The culprit was a very stagnant upper atmospheric pattern featuring a weak upper low that developed in early September across south Texas and slowly migrated east-northeast through September 22nd, until a more significant upper trough dropping south into the southern plains finally moved the pesky upper low northeast of Georgia.  In addition, an unusually deep tropical flow was noted throughout this period.  Precipitable water values exceeded 2.0 inches across the area during much of this period, resulting in extremely efficient rain producing cells.  Persistent heavy rain showers and thunderstorms began to plague the area on the 16th, and persisted daily through the 21st across parts of north and central Georgia.||However, the catastrophic flooding unfolded when a sea breeze moving northwest merged with existing outflow boundaries and higher terrain across the western suburbs of Atlanta to result in persistent heavy thunderstorms for a period of at least 12 hours that trained across the same counties west of Atlanta, generally affecting Carroll, Douglas, Paulding and Cobb counties.  As the activity progressed across the state, significant flooding unfolded further east, including Fulton county, and the city of Atlanta, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties.  Incredible rainfall amounts of 15 to over 20 inches, were observed from northeast Carroll, through much of Douglas, into eastern Paulding and southern Cobb counties.  Rainfall amounts of 10 to 15 inches were noted across parts of Fulton, Dekalb, and Gwinnett.  Rainfall amounts of 8 to 12 inches were noted in other more spotty areas of northwest, north central, and central Georgia during this period.||The excessive rainfall on top of saturated ground resulted in some of the worst flooding ever reported in the Atlanta and north Georgia area.  Eleven deaths were recorded during the event, mostly vehicle related deaths at night from washed out bridges and roads as a result of swollen creeks.  Property damages are estimated to be at least $0.5 Billion, with hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed by flood waters.  Bridges on several state and local highways were washed out and some will take months to even a year to replace.   Eighteen counties (Bartow, Carroll, Chattooga, Cherokee, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Heard, Newton, Paulding, Rockdale, Stephens, and Walker) received a presidential disaster declaration as a result of the historic floods.  Twenty-one counties were declared eligible for public assistance, including several central Georgia counties that were affected by flash flooding earlier in the period.||Some of the worst flooding was observed along Sweetwater Creek near the Cobb, Fulton, Douglas county line.  Hundreds of homes were flooded and destroyed as the waters of Sweetwater Creek rose more than 20 feet above flood level.||Many main stem and secondary creeks, streams, and rivers across north and central Georgia, particularly in northwest and west central Georgia, reached record flood levels.

More than 40 roads across the county were completely washed out, including Post Road just south of Interstate-20.  A portion of Interstate-20 near Fairburn Road was closed for nearly 12-hours causing major traffic backups throughout the region.  The main line of the Norfolk-Southern railroad near Villa Rica was also washed out.  A seventh person in Douglas county fell victim to the raging flood waters.  A 29-year old female perished when she was swept away in her vehicle by flood waters from the Dog River at 451 am EDT.  Over 1200 residents in the county were left without power as several tress in water logged soils fell on adjacent power lines.  This primarily affected areas near and including Arbor Place Mall along Interstate-20 near Fairburn Road.  Schools throughout the county were closed because of many impassable and flooded roads.  Many homes, businesses, and roads across the county sustained tremendous damage.  Washed out bridges will result in some roads being closed for up to a year, including portions of Georgia Highway 166 near Campbellton.  Monetary damage to roads and property during this time frame was estimated to be close to $9 million.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8.70M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Major flooding was noted in many other areas of north and central Georgia, including the eastern suburbs of Atlanta, northwest Georgia, and parts of central Georgia.  The culprit was a very stagnant upper atmospheric pattern featuring a weak upper low that developed in early September across south Texas and slowly migrated east-northeast through September 22nd, until a more significant upper trough dropping south into the southern plains finally moved the pesky upper low northeast of Georgia.  In addition, an unusually deep tropical flow was noted throughout this period.  Precipitable water values exceeded 2.0 inches across the area during much of this period, resulting in extremely efficient rain producing cells.  Persistent heavy rain showers and thunderstorms began to plague the area on the 16th, and persisted daily through the 21st across parts of north and central Georgia.||However, the catastrophic flooding unfolded when a sea breeze moving northwest merged with existing outflow boundaries and higher terrain across the western suburbs of Atlanta to result in persistent heavy thunderstorms for a period of at least 12 hours that trained across the same counties west of Atlanta, generally affecting Carroll, Douglas, Paulding and Cobb counties.  As the activity progressed across the state, significant flooding unfolded further east, including Fulton county, and the city of Atlanta, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties.  Incredible rainfall amounts of 15 to over 20 inches, were observed from northeast Carroll, through much of Douglas, into eastern Paulding and southern Cobb counties.  Rainfall amounts of 10 to 15 inches were noted across parts of Fulton, Dekalb, and Gwinnett.  Rainfall amounts of 8 to 12 inches were noted in other more spotty areas of northwest, north central, and central Georgia during this period.||The excessive rainfall on top of saturated ground resulted in some of the worst flooding ever reported in the Atlanta and north Georgia area.  Eleven deaths were recorded during the event, mostly vehicle related deaths at night from washed out bridges and roads as a result of swollen creeks.  Property damages are estimated to be at least $0.5 Billion, with hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed by flood waters.  Bridges on several state and local highways were washed out and some will take months to even a year to replace.   Eighteen counties (Bartow, Carroll, Chattooga, Cherokee, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Heard, Newton, Paulding, Rockdale, Stephens, and Walker) received a presidential disaster declaration as a result of the historic floods.  Twenty-one counties were declared eligible for public assistance, including several central Georgia counties that were affected by flash flooding earlier in the period.||Some of the worst flooding was observed along Sweetwater Creek near the Cobb, Fulton, Douglas county line.  Hundreds of homes were flooded and destroyed as the waters of Sweetwater Creek rose more than 20 feet above flood level.||Many main stem and secondary creeks, streams, and rivers across north and central Georgia, particularly in northwest and west central Georgia, reached record flood levels.  Many of these same creeks, streams, and rivers remained in flood for several days.  In some cases, all time record flood levels were recorded.  The following is a list of new record flood levels set on several creeks, streams, and rivers in north and west Georgia.  Noonday Creek near Woodstock rose to 19.6 feet on the 21st at 530 pm EDT.

This started the runoff from a deep snow pack over the West Virginia mountainous counties.  A widespread 2 to 4 inches of water resided in the snow pack with some ridgetops exceeding 6 inches of water in the snow.  ||Flood concerns were high preceding the event, but mainly for the central and northern mountain counties of the state.  The deepest snow cover still resided across the high terrain in those counties.  Prior to the heavy rain, the snow cover over Fayette and Raleigh Counties had already melted away.  However, the ground was left soggy and primed to allow for a quick runoff.||Governor Manchin even declared a state of emergency before any rain arrived. ||An increasing southeast flow developed on Friday the 12th with dew points climbing into the mid and upper 40s.  The support for the showers was provided by a large mid and upper air low circulation, shifting east into the Tennessee Valley. |   |Showers developed early that evening, then moved northwest through the southern mountains of West Virginia into the Coal and Kanawha River Valleys.  A few thunderstorms were embedded within the heavier showers.  Training of these cells occurred in narrow bands oriented in an arch from southeast to northwest. ||Luckily, the heavy rain never transferred further north, where the mountain snow pack was still melting. ||In a 6 hour period ending at 0100E on the 13th, the Raleigh County Airport received 2.58 inches of rain, while Charleston had 0.80 inches.   By 0700E on the 13th, Beckley had a 3 inch rain total.   Oak Hill in Fayette County had 2.95 inches ending at dawn on the 13th.  The cooperative observer in Beckley measured 2.12 inches.  The Huff Knob automated rain gauge near Ghent measured 2.76 inches in the 12 hour overnight period.  On Tams Mountain, west of Sophia, another automatic rain gauge measured 2.1 inches in 12 hours.  Oceana of northern Wyoming County measured 2.3 inches.  Amounts around 2 inches in 12 hours were common through the Big Coal River Valley to around Charleston.  An unofficial spotter report of 3.6 inches was received just 1 mile southeast of downtown Beckley.  Further north, rain amounts around an inch reached into Nicholas County.  ||After dawn on the 13th, only spotty light rain lingered in the cooler air.  ||Major small stream flooding was widespread in Raleigh and Fayette Counties.  There were 2 direct fatalities from Raleigh County.  Flooding of less severity occurred in  Kanawha, Nicholas, Boone, and Wyoming Counties.  ||During the daylight hours on the 13th, the Kanawha and Coal Rivers rose rapidly and caused backwater flooding.  For example, the mouth of Paint Creek flooded in the Hansford and Pratt vicinity.  Later that night, the Coal River crested at 25.5 feet at Tornado, slightly over its 25 foot flood stage.  The crest on the Kanawha at Charleston was 29 feet, just under the 30 foot flood stage.||The American Red Cross served over 1000 meals and around 900 snacks in the affected flood zone.  They also distributed over 400 clean-up kits.  The Salvation Army and various church groups also came to the aid of the local citizens.  ||A federal disaster was declared that included Raleigh, Fayette, and Kanawha Counties.  See FEMA disaster number 1893 for more details.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Major stream flooding along such streams as Piney, Beaver, Little Beaver, Little Whitestick, and the headwaters of Dunloup Creek, including Maple Fork. Damage was less along the Marsh Fork and Clear Fork drainage in the western portion of the county. ||A 59 year old female turnpike worker was returning home from the evening shift.  She left her vehicle parked and attempted to walk through the flood waters of Maple Fork west of Bradley.  She was swept away and drowned.||The majority of the property damage in Raleigh County was along the urbanized Beaver Creek, Little Beaver Creek, and Piney Creek.  This would be in the vicinity of the communities of Beaver and Glen Morgan.  A stream gauge was located along Piney Creek upstream from the mouth of Beaver Creek.  The water level at this gauge rose from about 3 feet to a record high of 11.4 feet around 0430E on the 13th.||One resident along Beaver Creek said, I've lived here for 24 years and never seen anything like this.  Other residents along the lower reaches of Beaver Creek sought refuge in their attics and called 911 for help.  A swift water rescue team from the Glasgow Fire Department was working rescues along Beaver Creek.  The boat struck something in the water, lost its steering and crashed into a bridge.  The boat capsized, throwing 3 firefighters into the water.  Two were able to reach safety.  However, a 32 year old male firefighter was swept away.  His body was not found until the 19th along Piney Creek.  Beaver Creek flows into Piney Creek before emptying into the Kanawha River.       ||Many culverts under roadbeds could not handle the flow.  A few were completely washed out. ||Preliminary data indicated 29 homes were destroyed in Raleigh County, with major damage to 34 other homes.

Severe flooding in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, M��xico from June 30th through July 2nd, from an estimated 30 inches of rain in this area was a portent of future impacts on the Rio Grande during the weeks to come, lasting for much of July and the first third of August. ||Major flooding continued for nearly a month at Rio Grande City - and by proxy, southwest Hidalgo County - continuing through August 3rd! Flood conditions (50 feet or higher) continued a few days beyond, with levels dropping below flood stage on August 10th at Rio Grande City and just a little bit later in southwest Hidalgo County. In total, the river was likely in flood at points downstream in southwest Hidalgo County, from the morning of July 9th through at least August 10th - more than month. ||A number of small communities along the Rio Grande west of the Lower Rio Grande Valley Flood Control System were impacted by the sprawling river into early August, while releases remained at 60,000 cubic feet per second at Falcon International Reservoir until July 29th. These communities included locations in southwest Hidalgo County. The system of levees and floodways (spillways) downstream of Penitas (where improved levees begin along the river itself) largely worked as designed, containing and diverting water along the river and associated floodways extending through southern and eastern Hidalgo County into extreme northern Cameron and extreme southern Willacy County. However, additional water damage occurred to properties built inside the levees and floodways. Voluntary and mandatory evacuations were ordered for a number of threatened communities; as of this writing, no fatalities had been reported directly from the high waters. There were dozens of water rescues on the river through the period, many of them trans migrants attempting to cross from Mexico into Texas. ||On August 3rd, President Obama declared most counties in the Rio Grande Valley a Major Disaster, eligible for federal funding to assist with the longer term recovery. Deep South Texas Counties included Cameron and Hidalgo. Property and Crop damages from the flood may ultimately total well over $50 million when all assessments are completed. As of the end of July, property damage estimates in Hidalgo County had reached $22 million. Crops planted in flood zones were destroyed by the long duration of nutrient rich waters. Note: final damage cost estimated are provided in the July Storm Data report.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flooding of the Lower Rio Grande Valley Flood Control Project floodway/levee system (spillway), which includes the Banker Floodway (from near Granjeno to just south of Pharr), the Main Floodway (from just south of Pharr to the split at the Arroyo Colorado just southwest of Mercedes, the Arroyo Colorado itself, and the North Floodway, (which extends from near Mercedes to near La Villa before curving east to northwest Cameron County), continued through a good portion of August, as water continued to be diverted through Anzalduas for several days beyond the time that water was receding upstream of the dam.  Continuing water diversion helps reduce the potential for backwater flooding along the improved levee section (Penitas to Anzalduas) as well as unprotected shorelines west of Penitas.  At the same time, the diversion maintained several feet of water in the floodways for days to come which receded more slowly.  The floodway emptied out for the most part by August 15th, but local high water hazards continued through at least the 18th.   ||These floodways, protected by a robust system of levees and gates, protected communities outside of the levees by containing up to 50%, or 4 to 8 to feet of fast flowing water, within them into the first third of August.  Unfortunately, a number of residences, dozens of paved and unpaved roads with low water bridges, and some agriculture are located within  the floodways; significant damage was noted in several locations.  Pumping and plugging operations near Weslaco and La Villa successfully kept high water out of poor drainage locations where the potential for freshwater flooding due to heavy rains would have been exacerbated with periodic thunderstorms, which did not materialize in August.  Closed roads included  FM 493 and FM 1015, each moderately traveled; at least five homes were flooded along the Main Floodway south of Pharr along I Road; 15 to 20 homes were asked to voluntarily evacuate, and at least two other residences were flooded south of Weslaco near FM 88. Floodwaters also submerged portions of the Llano Grande golf course in Mercedes. ||Voluntary evacuations were finally lifted along I Road (Capote Farms subdivision) on August 18th at 6 PM CST, where the 15 to 20 homes mentioned above were located.  Wet, muddy conditions continued in these areas until the last week of August; damage assessments began on roadways and bridges impacted in the floodway after the waters finally receded.  In all, the floodways contained water for more than 6 weeks.||High flowing water along the river covered a large portion of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge (Santa Ana) south and southeast of Pharr, including a number of unpaved roads.  Damage to the roads was unknown at this time; the flooding occurred downstream of the Anzalduas Diversion Dam; river gages downstream at San Benito and Brownsville remained in action stage.  Floodwaters did not reach public or private structures, nor roadways, between the Refuge and the Main Floodway.  The water finally receded back to muddy pockets sometime between August 27th and 28th.||There was one reported fatality in early August; a man drowned after reportedly driving his vehicle accidentally into the fast flowing waters of the floodway late on August 1st or early on August 2nd. His body was found along the south side of the Main Floodway, near S. Jackson and W. Juan Balli Road just west of Pharr.  ||Several crops may have been destroyed by the flood along the Main and North Floodways, but damage was unknown as of this writing in this area.

A persistent southerly low level jet brought very moist air into the area, which resulted in high rainfall rates. A coastal front along the I-95 corridor enhanced rainfall in that area. This event followed a heavy rainfall and record flooding event in mid-March as well as a second lesser rain event about a week prior. Rivers across much of Massachusetts and Rhode Island were still high from those events and warm temperatures in northern Vermont and New Hampshire resulted in a period of snowmelt, that resulted in rises on both the mainstem Connecticut and Merrimack Rivers. All of these factors led to a second record rainfall and flooding event. ||Two day rainfall totals across Southern New England ranged from an inch to ten inches. Though concentrated in Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, all of Southern New England was affected by the flooding. In Massachusetts, two day rainfall totals ranged from one and a half inches on Cape Cod to nearly eight inches in Bristol County.  Providence, Boston, and Blue Hill Observatory in Milton, MA set record monthly precipitation totals during the month of March. Providence also set the record for the wettest month ever in the period of record. Both the Pawtuxet River in Rhode Island and the Sudbury River in Massachusetts set floods of record.  Nearly 1000 Massachusetts National Guardsmen were activated to aid in sandbagging and evacuations.  President Obama issued federal disaster declarations for seven counties in Massachusetts following the mid-March flooding.  After this second round of flooding, residents of the seven counties (Bristol, Essex, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester) received an automatic extension for filing their state and federal taxes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Four to eight inches of rain fell across Bristol County resulting in several small streams rising above flood stage, including the Mill River in Taunton, the Canoe River at Norton, the Wading River at Norton, and the Segregansett River at Dighton, all of which set records.||Basements flooded in Taunton, North Attleboro, Attleboro, Norton, Mansfield, and Acushnet.  Numerous streets were closed due to flooding in Taunton, Fall River, Dartmouth, Norton, Dighton, Raynham, Somerset, North Attleboro, Attleboro, Freetown, Westport, Berkley, Mansfield, Rehoboth, and Swansea, including Route 6 in Westport, Interstate 195 at Exit 3 in Swansea, Route 24 in Dartmouth, and Route 140 in Freetown (exit 8).  The North Attleboro Town Hall sustained $350,000 worth of damage from flooding and Richards Memorial Library was closed for several weeks after the basement was flooded with water and sewage.  A pond at Capron Park Zoo in Attleboro overflowed, threatening zoo buildings.  It was able to be pumped out, keeping water out of most of the buildings.  One building was flooded with two feet of water, damaging boxes of gift shop items and supplies.||Route 44 on the Taunton/Raynham line was closed for the second time in a month due to flooding from the Taunton River.  An amphibious vehicle from the Boston Duck Tours was called into service to ferry residents from isolated neighborhoods to nearby supermarkets and pharmacies.||One bridge (Wheeler Street) was destroyed and three others damaged in Rehoboth when the Palmer River flooded.  Portions of two of the damaged bridges (Danforth and Elm Streets) were undermined and washed away and the Summer Street bridge sustained structural damage.  Two people were rescued when they fell into the Palmer River while trying to rescue their dog.  They were transported to Rhode Island Hospital.||Sixteen year round residents at the Canoe River Camp Ground in Mansfield were evacuated.  Three apartment buildings on Riverbank Road in Attleboro were completely surrounded by water overflowing from the Ten Mile River.  The Seven Mile River in South Attleboro overflowed its banks, flooding Pitas Avenue, isolating twenty homes.  Six structures in North Attleboro were evacuated because of flooding.||In hard-hit Fall River: Numerous roads were flooded, including Columbia Street and Mount Hope Avenue.  Storm water overwhelmed storm drains, blowing out of the manholes with such force that it ripped up pavement, gravel, and utilities.  Twenty nine homes lost power and gas service when the utilities were ripped up.  Bricks from sidewalks along Columbia Street floated down Canal and Columbia Streets, collecting in piles on Broadway and Anawan Street.  Doran Elementary School was flooded and the sewage treatment plant became overwhelmed with flood waters.  A vehicle became stuck in floodwaters, trapping the occupants.  Railroad tracks were under water at Interstate 195 and at Route 6.  The southbound lanes of Route 24 were closed from President Avenue to Route 195.  A 25 foot wide sinkhole developed on Jackson Street.  At least 300 people were evacuated from their homes.  The mayor declared a state of emergency.||In Freetown:  85 school-children were taken to a shelter after flooding made it impossible for buses to take them home.  The Assonet Bay Shores neighborhood (home to about 1000 people) was cutoff to regular traffic by floodwaters and the collapse of a Narrows Road/Causeway Road bridge.  Eleven students at the Crystal Springs School (a learning center for children and adults with learning disabilities) were stuck at the school for an evening after the bridge collapsed.  They were able to be transported back to the main part of the city when two mountain rescue vehicles owned by the state police were dispatched.  The vehicles remained in place for several days to transport residents between the neighborhood and the rest of the city.  A bridge 20 yards downstream from the Forge Pond Dam crumbled, leaving a four foot gap in Forge Road.  Fifteen households in Assonet Village were evacuated  as Forge Pond continued to rise.  Schools were closed early Tuesday, March 30 and for the day Wednesday, March 31 due to flooding.  ||There were three minor house fires in Mansfield that were the result of floodwaters reaching burners and electrical panels in basements.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 23.58M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This resulted in widespread rainfall totals of three to six inches.  In eastern Massachusetts, a strong southeasterly low level jet pumped ample moisture into the area, resulting in rainfall totals on the order of six to ten inches.  This resulted in major flooding across eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island, including small stream, urban, and poor drainage flooding.  In addition, the Concord River at Lowell, the Shawsheen River at Wilimington, and the Pawtuxet River at Cranston reached record flood stages within two to four days of the rain.  The Governor of Massachusetts declared a state of emergency and this was followed by a federal disaster declaration for seven Massachusetts counties.||Strong winds associated with the low pressure system and the low level jet affected both the east and south coasts, resulting in numerous downed trees and wires and some minor structural damage to a few buildings.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Several small streams rose above flood stage across Essex County, including the Ipswich River at Ipswich and South Middleton, the Shawsheen River at Andover, and the Parker River at Byfield.

Portions of Merrimack College in Andover were flooded, submerging trees downed by the wind.  Several cars were stranded in floodwaters, including one in Saugus at the Shaws parking lot, three on Woburn Street in Andover, and two on Foster Street in Peabody.  Several people were trapped in the cars in Peabody, but were successfully rescued.  Many streets in downtown Peabody were under four feet of water.  Collections at the Stevens Memorial Library in North Andover were damaged by floodwaters.||In Lawrence, a total of 50 homes on Willow Street, Exchange Street, and Myrtle Street were evacuated.  In addition, twenty eight people in the Holiday Inn Express on Winthrop Street were evacuated due to flooding in the hotel.  Approximately 25 three tenant homes along the Spicket River were evacuated.  The Carriage Hill Apartments in Amesbury were evacuated due to flooding from a nearby pond.  The Washington Park Condos and all 110 residents of the Marland Place Assisted Living Center in Andover were evacuated.||A 500 foot stretch of Route 62 in Danvers was closed when a fifteen foot deep sinkhole developed because of an underground culvert that was washed out after nearly eight inches of rain fell.  It reopened nearly three weeks later after work was delayed by a second major rainstorm.|A sewer treatment plant in Gloucester processed roughly 15 million gallons of wastewater during the storm, nearly 5 times capacity.  As a result, excess wastewater was combined with runoff and released into the harbor.||One fatality indirectly resulted from the flooding when a 49 year old man drowned while pumping water from his office.

These training rains first affected Jackson and Vinton Counties between 0500E and 0600E on Sunday May 2nd.  The heaviest rains arched into Athens County and eventually sank slowly south, to affect Lawrence, Gallia, and Meigs Counties later in the day.||The rains continued into the evening hours on the 2nd, then diminished during the late evening.  However, some light rain lingered until after midnight on the 3rd.||The rain amounts over about an 18 to 20 hour period were mostly 3.5 to 4.5 inches across Lawrence, Jackson, Viinton, Gallia, Meigs, and Athens Counties.  Waterloo in northern Lawrence County reported 4.8 inches for the maximum.  McArthur in Vinton County and Jackson in Jackson County both measured around 4.3 inches.  The town of Athens had 4.1 inches, while Gallipolis had 3.9 inches, and South Point measured 3.8 inches.  An automatic gauge in Gallia County, between Gallipolis and Rio Grande measured 3.7 inches.||Small stream flooding was common.  Roads were flooded. Some small bridges and culverts were washed out.  Two men drowned near the Athens County line in Morgan County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Roads were flooded, but damage to dwellings was minimal.  Two brothers from Athens County died while on a fishing trip.  Their flooded vehicle was found along the East Branch of Sunday Creek above Burr Oak Reservoir.

This system brought scattered heavy-rain producing thunderstorms to eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.  For many areas it was the 3rd day-in-a-row with significant or heavy rain.  Many locations from central into northeast Nebraska received 3 to 4 inches or more rainfall in the 72 hours ending the morning of the 12th.  This additional heavy rain fell on saturated soils from rainfall prior to the 10th and prolonged, intensified or increased the coverage of flooding across eastern Nebraska and helped shift the flooding to larger rivers.  Flood damage over Nebraska in mid to late June amounted to at least 20 million dollars to public property alone and which did not account for damage to private property or crops.  The White House declared a federal disaster for 53 counties in Nebraska for June flooding.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Rainfall of at least 3 to 5 inches fell over much of the upper Elkhorn River basin in the week ending 7am 6/12.  This caused record or near record flooding along the Elkhorn River from around Clearwater and Neligh downstream to the Elkhorn's confluence with the Platte River.  The flooding was prolonged and intensified by additional rains the next few days.  In Madison county many gravel roads along the Elkhorn were flooded as were Highways 81 and 275 near and west of Norfolk which were closed for a while.  On 6/15 a railroad bridge just southwest of Norfolk washed away with 3 people on it that were assessing possible damage.  One person was drowned, the 2 others were rescued.  Another railroad bridge west of Norfolk and several sections of the Cowboy Trail bike trail was washed out.  A levee just south of Norfolk helped prevent major damage, but some damage was noted to businesses and nearly 70 homes on the south part of town despite sandbagging. In addition a park on the south side of town received extensive damage.  Farmland along the river sustained crop damage and had sand deposited on fields by the receding river.   The Elkhorn River near Norfolk reached a record crest of around 16.9 feet during the evening of 6/16, flood stage is 12 feet.  The river at Norfolk was above flood stage from the early morning hours of June 15th until mid evening on the 17th, although flooding likely started earlier upstream of the levee near Norfolk.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several locations in the Susquehanna Basin came close to records set by Hurricane Agnes (June 1972) and a few points (Bloomsburg, Hershey and Loyalsockville) set new floods of record. Flooding along Swatara Creek resulted in property damage and several deaths. Severe flooding occurred along Loyalsock Creek and many points along the main-stem of the Susquehanna River. The interaction of a stalled frontal boundary over the Mid-Atlantic region, a strong northern stream short-wave (with a persistent jet entrance region) and deep tropical moisture associated the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee resulted in multi-day, significant heavy rainfall event over Pennsylvania. ||Tropical storm Lee was the twelfth named storm of the 2011 season forming over the Gulf of Mexico on September 1. A strong northern stream short-wave interacted with Lee causing the storm to re-curve to the north-northeast. By 1200 UTC September 6, having undergone extra-tropical transition, post-tropical Lee was located over northern Georgia. The surface low weakened as it moved up the Appalachian Mountain chain. However, the strong low-level flow and the above normal precipitable water produced an extensive, north-to-south oriented band of heavy rainfall.||The rainfall associated with the remnants of Lee produced the 4th largest flood of record in the Mid-Atlantic Region. The five-day storm rainfall totals for September 5 to 9 were generally in the 5-8 inch range over the mid-section of central Pennsylvania and in the 8-12 inch range in the Susquehanna Valley region. There were local amounts reported in excess of 15 inches east of the Susquehanna River. The local climate sites in Harrisburg (KMDT) and Williamsport (KIPT) reported 13.44 and 9.03 inches respectively. On September 7, 2011 both KMDT and KIPT set their all-time daily (24-hour) rainfall for the month of September at 7.71 and 6.76 inches respectively. These sites later went on to break the all-time monthly (September) and annual precipitation records, making 2011 the wettest year on record.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Swatara Creek near Hershey crested at major flood stage, 26.8 feet.  Flood stage is 7.0 feet. Swatara Creek at Middletwon crested at major flood stage, estimated at 26.30 feet.  Flood stage is 11.0 feet.  This is the 5th highest all time.||The Susquehanna River at Harrisburg crested in major flood stage at 25.17 feet.  Flood stage is 17 feet.  This is the 5th highest crest on record.||While the Susquehanna River flooded a large area of Harrisburg, some areas were fortunate enough to escape the flood waters.  Midtown and Uptown residents were largely unscathed, though widespread power outages were reported.  The river levels crested several feet below that of Agnes, thanks in part to less contribution from the West Branch of the Susquehanna.||Between 8,000 and 10,000 residents were evacuated.  The Shipoke area of downtown reported significant flooding. City Island was also hard hit, with the baseball stadium under at least seven feet of water, prompting the double A baseball team to have to play its playoff games on the road.||Major damage was widespread in Hershey.  Hersheypark and ZooAmerica both reported major damage with 8 feet of water in low lying areas of Hershey Park.  Many structures were flooded and many roads suffered damage.  A ramp off of Route 322 near the Penn State Hershey Medical Center had a 3-foot deep trench cut across the road.  Swatara Creek cut a wide and devastating flood path.  Evacuations were noted in Palmyra, Derry Township and Middletown.||A 70-year old man died when a basement wall collapsed on him in Derry Township. He was pumping water from his flooded basement. A second man died in flood waters. While details surrounding his death are unknown, his mud covered car and body were found in Swatara Township several days after the flooding. A third man, 81 years old, drowned after his car was washed into Clarks Creek in Middle Paxton Township. Finally, a fourth victim, a 54 year old female, was swept away by flood waters. Her body was recovered weeks later in Swatara Creek.||Water rescues were widespread in Dauphin County.  One county rescuer was quoted, ���We were rescuing people on the way to rescuing people,��� Leonard said. ���There was no time for introductions or salutations. We were dispatched every 90 seconds for hours.���||Severe flooding occurred on Spring Creek.  House flooding, closed roads and water rescues using boats were conducted in Paxtang Borough and Swatara Township.  Three-quarters of all roads were flooded in Derry Township. Middletown on the mouth of Swatara Creek, where it enters the Susquehanna River also reported major flooding.  Five of the eighteen homes on Few Avenue were condemned from flood damage.  The basements of these homes were visible from the street through giant holes in the foundation.  Residents also reported a foul smell after the floods, with one resident saying, ���Imagine the contents of a septic tank mixed with diesel and fuel oil.���||A preliminary total of 295 buildings were destroyed, 1040 suffered major damage, and 1273 suffered minor damage with a total of 3348 structures impacted. Overall damage was estimated at $150 million.  In addition, 368 acres of crops were destroyed with an estimated value of $700,000.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid. The declaration was later extended throughout the state.||The highest wind gusts recorded during Hurricane Irene were 75 mph at Cape May Ferry Terminal (Cape May County), 69 mph in Harvey Cedars (Ocean County), 69 mph in Tuckerton (Ocean County), 68 mph in Cape May Harbor (Cape May County), 66 mph at the Atlantic City Marina (Atlantic County), 66 mph in Ocean City (Cape May County), 65 mph in Point Pleasant (Ocean County), 58 mph in Atlantic City (Atlantic County), 58 mph in Sandy Hook (Monmouth County), 58 mph in Brick (Ocean County), 57 mph in Keansburg (Monmouth County), 55 mph in Barnegat Light (Ocean County), 55 mph at Lakehurst NAS (Ocean County), 55 mph at Point Point (Atlantic County), 55 mph in Seaside Heights (Ocean County), 53 mph at Wildwood (Cape May County), 52 mph in Belmar (Monmouth County), 52 mph in Bivalve (Cumberland County), 52 mph in Trenton (Mercer County), 51 mph at Ft Dix-Wrightstown (Burlington County), 50 mph in Wantage (Sussex County), 47 mph in Mount Holly (Burlington County) and 42 mph in Somerville (Somerset County).||Peak storm tides included 9.75 feet above mean lower low water in Sandy Hook (Monmouth County). Severe tidal flooding starts at 8.7 feet above mean lower low water. This was the third highest tide on record and highest tide since the December 1992 nor'easter.

Along tidal sections of the Delaware River, Big Timber Creek flooded along the Gloucester and Camden County lines and about 300 homes in Burlington City (Burlington County) had flooded basements.   ||Hurricane Irene formed east of the Leeward Islands on Saturday the 20th. It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.||Irene helped make August 2011 the wettest August on record for the state of New Jersey dating back to 1895.

Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid.

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.||Irene helped make August 2011 the wettest August on record for the state of New Jersey dating back to 1895.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th.

Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.

Moderate stream and river flooding occurred in the Poconos and Lehigh Valley and moderate to major river flooding occurred in southeast Pennsylvania. For many places in southeastern Pennsylvania, it was the worst creek and river flooding since Hurricane Floyd in 1999 or the remnants of Hurricane Jeanne in 2004. Flooding along non-tidal sections of the Delaware River was minor to moderate. There were two direct storm caused deaths: a wind related death in Monroe County and a drowning in Montgomery County.  About 500,000 PECO Energy and 420,000 Pennsylvania Power and Light customers lost power in Eastern Pennsylvania. For both utilities this ranked within the top five outages of all time.  Preliminary damage estimates were around six million dollars. In addition to property damage, the winds and rains badly damaged the corn crop in southeastern Pennsylvania. The Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area was closed through Labor Day Weekend (September 5th). ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread Eastern Pennsylvania during the evening of the 27th and persisted into the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread Eastern Pennsylvania during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest from during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 3 to 7 inches and caused widespread flooding. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate tidal flooding along tidal sections of the Delaware River overnight on the 27th. Minor tidal flooding occurred during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. | |In Stroudsburg (Monroe County), a 44-year-old man died when a tree fell on him in his backyard. He pushed his son to safety. Governor Tom Corbett declared a state of emergency for the city of Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs.

Three large shelters on the evening of August 27th in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia International Airport closed at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 27th and reopened on Monday the 29th. In Philadelphia, the storm left thousands without power. More than 500 trees fell in the city, seven buildings collapsed and twenty roads were closed. PECO Energy restored power by August 31st.||The highest wind gusts recorded during Irene were 57 mph in Mount Pocono (Monroe County), 53 mph in Allentown (Lehigh County), 52 mph at the Philadelphia International Airport (Philadelphia County), 48 mph in Reading (Berks County), 46 mph in Coatesville (Chester County), 45 mph in Northeast Philadelphia (Philadelphia County), 44 mph in Pottstown (Montgomery County), 44 mph in Newbold (Bucks County) and 40 mph in Quakertown (Bucks County). The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.89 feet above mean lower low water during the early morning of the 28th. Moderate tidal flooding begins at 9.20 feet above mean lower low water. ||Hurricane Irene formed east of the Leeward Islands on Saturday the 20th. It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th and then proceeded to the northnortheast and went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th.

Road closures due to creeks and streams developed as early as Monday March 21st, and quickly spread across a large portion of southern Minnesota. By March 23rd, several areas along the Minnesota River between the southwestern suburbs of the Twin Cities, to Mankato started to close. This included Highways 93 and 19 near Henderson, and Scott County Road 9 near Jordan. In addition, Lac Qui Parle, Yellow Medicine, Brown, Watonwan, Blue Earth, Sibley, Scott and McLeod Counties had several county roads closed or impassable by Wednesday March 23rd. ||A large storm system on March 22nd and 23rd dropped on average one half to 1.50 inches of liquid precipitation across the area. However, as much colder air began to move south on the 23rd, all of the precipitation switched over to snow.||By Wednesday, March 23rd, major river crossings in the Twin Cities began to close due to the flood waters; this included Highway 41 near Chaska and Highway 101 near Shakopee. In addition, more county roads started to close across southern Minnesota, and Highway 65 in Albert Lea shut down.||The last week of March, most of the Minnesota River and its tributaries had their first crests. However, a cold spell the last week of March, caused the rivers to fall or hold steady as the runoff from the snow melt abated.  ||Although ice jams were reported across the area, one ice jam on the Seven Mile Creek near St. Peter resulted in a fatality on March 22 when a MNDOT worker tried to clear the ice jam and his Backhoe tipped over and fell into the area where Seven Mile Creek flows into the Minnesota River.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Several highways and county roads from North Mankato, northward along the Minnesota River to Le Sueur, Minnesota were impassable due to Spring flooding.

In Crittenden County, the community of Tolu was threatened. In Livingston County, homes were threatened in Birdsville, and a few homes were surrounded by water in Ledbetter. Just west of Paducah, a 90-year-old man drowned (direct fatality) after he drove around barricades down a flooded secondary road. This incident occurred during the early afternoon hours of March 20, around 1 to 2 P.M. The victim could not see the edge of the road and ended up submerged in 12 feet of water in a ditch. Several people who tried to rescue the victim were taken to a local hospital for treatment of hypothermia. In western McCracken County, several homes were threatened, and they were protected with sandbags. All along the Ohio River, a number of roadways were closed. Most of the closed roads across the region were rural county and state roads. There was considerable flooding of low-lying fields and woodlands near the river. Riverside parks and recreation areas were flooded. Very few residences were flooded. The crest at the Paducah river gage was 47.81 feet, which was nearly identical to the January, 2005 flood and almost four feet lower than the 1997 flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Irene moved through the Caribbean and up the east coast of the United States making landfall twice. She first made landfall as a Category 1 Hurricane near Cape Lookout, North Carolina around 7:30am on August 27, then moved offshore again during the evening. She then made a 2nd landfall, again as a Category 1 Hurricane at 540am on August 28 near Little Egg Inlet in New Jersey. She moved over New York City and then into southeastern New York State and Connecticut as a Tropical Storm a few hours later. By the end of the evening of the 28th, Irene was crossing the U.S./Canada border having produced significant amounts of rain, storm surge, inland and coastal flooding, and wind damage across southern New England and much of the east coast of the United States. ||In Southern New England, the minimum surface pressure recorded was 976.9mb taken at Barnes Municipal Airport in Westfield, Massachusetts. The storm surge experienced along the coast was generally in the two to four foot range with a high of 4.78 feet at Fox Point in Providence, Rhode Island. The highest sustained windspeed was 54 knots (62 mph) at the Physical Oceanographic Real Time System station at Conimicut Light in Narragansett Bay, RI. The highest sustained wind speed on land was 38 knots (44 mph) recorded on the Automated Surface Observing Systems at both Barnstable Municipal Airport in Hyannis, MA (KHYA) and Logan International Airport in Boston, MA (KBOS). Rainfall amounts ranged from nearly zero (0.03 at Nantucket Memorial Airport - ACK) to nearly 10 inches (9.92 in Conway, MA). ||Despite the relatively low wind speeds, sustained winds over a 6 to 12 hour long duration resulted in widespread tree damage and resulted in power outages to roughly half a million customers throughout the state. Some of these customers did not get their power back until the Friday following the storm (some five days later). Durring the passage of Tropical Storm Irene, the winds resulted in $60M in property damages and inland flooding resulted in 1 fatality and $8M in property damages. ||Bunnell Brook in Burlington had its third worst flood on record.  The Farmington River reached its highest levels since Tropical Storms Connie and Diane in 1955.||The collective effects of Tropical Storm Irene on August 28, resulted in 1 fatality, 0 injuries, and $127.3M in property damage in the following counties: Barnstable, Bristol, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, Middlesex, Nantucket, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester (all in MA), Hartford, Tolland, and Windham (all in CT), Cheshire and Hillsborough (all in NH), and Bristol, Providence, Kent, Washington, and Newport (all in RI).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Four to ten inches of heavy rain from Tropical Storm Irene resulted in the Pequabuck River overflowing its banks.  This led to flooding on roads and homes along the river throughout Bristol.  Flooded roads ran approximately three and a half feet deep.  A 46 year old man went canoeing in floodwaters.  He drowned when his canoe capsized and he was unable to make it to shore.  At least 50 people were evacuated from areas around the river, and took shelter at Chippens Hill Middle School.  The river flooding undermined at least 7 feet of Route 72 eastbound, washing out this portion of the road.  Numerous houses and businesses were affected by the flooding.

Several locations in the Susquehanna Basin came close to records set by Hurricane Agnes (June 1972) and a few points (Bloomsburg, Hershey and Loyalsockville) set new floods of record. Flooding along Swatara Creek resulted in property damage and several deaths. Severe flooding occurred along Loyalsock Creek and many points along the main-stem of the Susquehanna River. The interaction of a stalled frontal boundary over the Mid-Atlantic region, a strong northern stream short-wave (with a persistent jet entrance region) and deep tropical moisture associated the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee resulted in multi-day, significant heavy rainfall event over Pennsylvania. ||Tropical storm Lee was the twelfth named storm of the 2011 season forming over the Gulf of Mexico on September 1. A strong northern stream short-wave interacted with Lee causing the storm to re-curve to the north-northeast. By 1200 UTC September 6, having undergone extra-tropical transition, post-tropical Lee was located over northern Georgia. The surface low weakened as it moved up the Appalachian Mountain chain. However, the strong low-level flow and the above normal precipitable water produced an extensive, north-to-south oriented band of heavy rainfall.||The rainfall associated with the remnants of Lee produced the 4th largest flood of record in the Mid-Atlantic Region. The five-day storm rainfall totals for September 5 to 9 were generally in the 5-8 inch range over the mid-section of central Pennsylvania and in the 8-12 inch range in the Susquehanna Valley region. There were local amounts reported in excess of 15 inches east of the Susquehanna River. The local climate sites in Harrisburg (KMDT) and Williamsport (KIPT) reported 13.44 and 9.03 inches respectively. On September 7, 2011 both KMDT and KIPT set their all-time daily (24-hour) rainfall for the month of September at 7.71 and 6.76 inches respectively. These sites later went on to break the all-time monthly (September) and annual precipitation records, making 2011 the wettest year on record.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Susquehanna River at Marietta crested in major flood stage at 58.16 feet.  Flood stage is 49.0 feet.  This is the 4th highest crest on record. The Conestoga River at Lancaster crested in major flood stage at 21.30 feet.  Flood stage is 11.0 feet.  This is the 2nd highest crest on record.||Life-threatening flash flooding affected a large part of western Lancaster County, inlcuding Elizabethtown, Manheim, Marietta and Columbia.||Mudslides, trapped motorists and flooded homes were widespread from Elizabethtown to Columbia in northwest Lancaster County.  Mount Joy and Marietta also experience major flooding.||At one point on the afternoon of the 8th, emergency dispatchers were handling more than a call per minute from stranded drivers and homeowners experiencing flooding.  The flooded roadways severely limited responders��� ability to reach those in need.  In Elizabethtown the only north-south road accessible was Mount Joy Road. A particularly dangerous water rescue occurred at 5pm when Maryland State Police helicopters rescued six motorists after their vehicles (large trucks) became disabled on East Main Street in Mount Joy. Multiple vehicles were stranded on Route 30 westbound at Prospect Road, west of Mountville. Mudslides closed parts of Route 441 and Elizabethtown Road. Most of the above mentioned Townships declared States of Emergency during this flood.  20 municipalities in total declared disasters. Cocalico Creek raged out of its banks during this event, flooding many locations in Ephrata Borough and Township.  At least 20 homes were condemned there, including an apartment building.  Water covered the bridge and all of Main Street.||Major flooding occurred along Chickies Creek in and near the Manheim area.  The southern side of Manheim was underwater from flooding along the creek, resulting in a significant number of structures flooding.   Route 72 was underwater from the creek.  At one point, cars were described as ���floating��� down Main Street in Manheim.  The Twin Kiss restaurant at Fruitville Pike and Main Street was partially submerged under about 4 feet of water.  Mayor Eric Phillips described Manheim as almost an island surrounded by rising floodwaters at one point during the storm. The Manheim Twin Kiss, a Manheim institution here for decades, had 3 feet of the water wash through it which toppled commercial refrigerators and other massive objects. In West Hempfield Township, a crew in boats helped a couple evacuate their home near Siegrist and Farmdale roads.||The 156 year-old Siegrist's Mill Bridge in Rapho Township was lost, as it was ravaged by flood waters from Chickies Creek on the afternoon of the 8th. During Agnes, the bridge shifted a few feet and was cemented back into place. Two other county-owned covered bridges, as well as two other conventional bridges, were closed for repairs because of the storm damage. They included Little Chickies No. 2 on Pinkerton Road, Little Chickies No. 4 on Drager Road, Big Conestoga No. 6, also called the Pinetown covered bridge on Bridge Road and Little Conestoga No. 1 on Shreiner Station Road.||Flooding along the Susquehanna was also reported in the Marietta area.  Structure flooding was widespread along several streets near the river.  A traditional Marietta measuring stick, at Shank's Tavern on Front Street, showed a watermark about 3 feet up the structure. That mark was a couple feet short of archived watermarks from a 1936 flood and the Hurricane Agnes flooding of 1972.||On the Conestoga River, Lancaster city officials evacuated residents from low-lying areas of Almanac Avenue and South Broad Street, near the river.  Crews also evacuated 25 people from Conestoga Boulevard in Conestoga Township, going door to door to ask them to leave their homes. Hundreds of roads were closed across the county, a county dispatch supervisor said. Parts of major routes were closed, including routes 222, 30, 23, 72, 441, 230, 322, 741 and 772.||PPL ordered the evacuation of its Holtwood Hydroelectric Plant on Thursday afternoon. The generating plant was shut down and about 20 plant employees were evacuated, beginning about 4 p.m. Another 80 workers involved in the ongoing $434 million expansion of the plant also were evacuated. The last time the hydroelectric plant went through an emergency shutdown and was evacuated was probably during Agnes, a PPL spokesman said.||Three deaths were noted in Lancaster County.	A 62-year-old woman in a vehicle became stranded on Route 322 near Pumping Station Road in Elizabeth Township Thursday morning. Her car was swept away in the water and submerged. An 8-year-old boy playing in a flooded backyard in East Cocalico Township was swept off his feet by the water. His head became caught in a submerged storm drain, where he was found by emergency personnel. He was taken to Ephrata Community Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A man was swept away as he tried to walk through water just off White Oak Road, near the border of Rapho and Penn townships.||A preliminary total of 32 structures were destroyed, 395 suffered major damage, and 1339 minor damage with a total of 1782 structures impacted. Damage was estimated at $818,110 for public facilities.  A total of 189 water rescues were performed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 800.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Another system passed to the south on the 23rd and 24th, continuing the precipitation across the area. A new all-time daily precipitation record for Billings was set on May 24th. These two systems brought a total of 4 to 7 inches of precipitation to the area through the 25th. From May 29th through May 31st, another Pacific storm system moved northeast through the Billings Forecast Area, producing a half inch to 2 inches of precipitation across the area. A few areas received close to 3 inches of precipitation. The culmination of precipitation events resulted in historic flooding across the Billings Forecast Area. The monthly precipitation for May resulted in the wettest May ever recorded in Billings.||Widespread, severe flooding occurred across the entire Billings Forecast Area. Many roads and bridges were damaged or washed out across the area, including closure of I-90 between Livingston and Springdale eastbound lanes. The Montana Department of Transportation alone estimated over $36 million in damage to state and federal highways across the state of Montana. Hundreds of homes and trailers and multiple businesses experienced flood damage. There was damage to flood control dams. On May 19th, Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer declared an emergency for the state. In addition, the Governor requested that the President declare a major disaster for the State of Montana on June 1st, as a result of substantial widespread flooding. Governor Schweitzer deployed the Montana National Guard in Roundup and Crow Agency to help with flood response efforts May 28th and 29th. Flood emergencies were declared by the Governor for all but three counties in the Billings Forecast area. Emergency declarations included the Crow Reservation in Big Horn County. There were two fatalities, an elderly woman in Boyd in Carbon County fell into a flooded ditch and was swept away, and a man from Huntley in Yellowstone County was killed on an excavator when flooding from Pryor Creek overtook him. Multiple Emergency Operation Centers and Incident Commands were set up across the area, including in Billings in Yellowstone County, and in Park County to coordinate flood relief and response efforts.||A persistant upslope northeast flow into the region resulted in another round of locally heavy rainfall again on May 29-30th. An additional 1-2 inches of rainfall were noted, especially for the Beartooth and Big Horn Mountain foothill areas. This resulted in prolonged or even renewed flooding in some locations through the end of the month.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Significant flooding occurred on creeks and streams across Carbon County with numerous county roads flooded, closing roads and resulting in significant damage. Emergency Travel only was advised at one point due to the severity of the flooding. Specifically, Rock Creek flooded, resulting in adjacent lowland flooding and closure of Grape Vine Road near Fromberg. Creeks were running out of their banks from the Beartooth Foothills between McLeod and Red Lodge, as well as tributaries of the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River from Belfry to Bridger. Five Mile Creek flooded and washed out the bridge on East Pryor Road between Edgar and Pryor. Blue Water Creek east of Bridger flooded and washed out a county road as well. The heavy rainfall also resulted in water running over the spillway at Cooney Dam. This resulted in several homes flooded along Red Lodge Creek. ||On May 25th, significant flooding was reported in the town of Joliet as debris backed up Rock Creek resulting in evacuations. At the peak of this flooding, Highway 212 was closed from Rockvale to Red Lodge as 18 inches of water was reported on Highway 212 through the town of Joliet. Fifty homes flooded in the area and seven people, mainly elderly, had to leave with the assistance of the fire and sheriffs offices. The Joliet Motel reported a foot of water in each of their rooms. ||In addition, an 84-year-old woman drowned after she fell into a flooded ditch near her house. She was going to get her newspaper when she slipped and fell. The woman was swept a short distance downstream from her house near Boyd, where authorities found her body.||Damage estimates based on FEMA reviews and Individual Assistance approvals.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Part of the asphalt pavement on U.S. Highway 70 was scoured away by the water between DeValls Bluff and Biscoe. The force of the water left holes two feet deep on Arkansas Highway 38 in the northern part of the county. Dozens of houses flooded in the Des Arc area and evacuations were necessary in DeValls Bluff. Altogether, more than 270 homes in the county suffered flood damage. On the 4th, a 53 year-old man was found drowned near his home in the North Side community near Des Arc. On the 4th, westbound lanes of Interstate 40 near Biscoe were closed when the White River overflowed onto the freeway. Motorists traveling from Memphis to Little Rock had to exit the interstate at Brinkley, take U.S. Highway 49 north to Fair Oaks, then U.S. Highway 64 to Bald Knob, then U.S. Highway 67/167 to Little Rock. This detour was about 120 miles long. On the 5th, the flood waters overtook the eastbound lanes of the interstate, making it the first time that the interstate had ever been closed by flooding on the White River. Motorists exited the interstate at Hazen and took U.S. Highway 63 to Stuttgart, then U.S. Highway 165 to DeWitt, then Arkansas Highway 1 back to the interstate at Forrest City. The eastbound detour lasted only one day before the White River flooded Arkansas Highway 1 at the Arkansas/Monroe County line and a new detour had to be established. The new detour took cars from Interstate 40 south on U.S. Highway 63 to Stuttgart, east on U.S. Highway 79 to U.S. Highway 49, and then north on 49 back to the interstate. Because the bridge over the White River is old and narrow with very narrow shoulders, trucks were unable to use this route and had to take a much longer detour. Trucks went south to Dumas via U.S. Highways 63, 79, and 65 or via U.S. Highways 63 and 165. From Dumas, the trucks followed U.S. Highway 65 south all the way to Lake Village, crossed the Mississippi River on U.S. Highway 82 through Greenville, Mississippi, and then turned north on U.S. Highway 61 to Memphis. Altogether, the truck detour added about 300 miles onto the trip from Little Rock to Memphis. Water on I-40 eventually rose to the top of the concrete wall in the median. The eastbound lanes of Interstate 40 reopened on the 9th, followed by the westbound lanes on the 11th.

Governor Schweitzer deployed the Montana National Guard in Roundup and Crow Agency to help with flood response efforts May 28th and 29th. Flood emergencies were declared by the Governor for all but three counties in the Billings Forecast area. Emergency declarations included the Crow Reservation in Big Horn County. There were two fatalities, an elderly woman in Boyd in Carbon County fell into a flooded ditch and was swept away, and a man from Huntley in Yellowstone County was killed on an excavator when flooding from Pryor Creek overtook him. Multiple Emergency Operation Centers and Incident Commands were set up across the area, including in Billings in Yellowstone County, and in Park County to coordinate flood relief and response efforts.||A persistant upslope northeast flow into the region resulted in another round of locally heavy rainfall again on May 29-30th.

Each storm followed nearly the same track along the Alaska Peninsula then along the Bering Sea coast, setting up a strong moist fetch into the Southcentral Alaska.  This resulted in widespread flood damage over a large area.  Storm total precipitation ranged from 21 to 27 inches along the eastern Kenai Peninsula, while further inland between 6-12 inches of rain fell along the Talkeetna Mountains north to the headwaters of the Nenana River.  A large number of roads and bridges were affected; damage to the Alaska Railroad was severe enough to shut down the rail service for several days.  Almost 60 homes were either severely damaged or destroyed and over 700 other homes were either affected or sustained minor damage; most of the damage occurred along the Little Susitna River and Willow Creek.  State estimates of damage to individual property approached $3.5 million, public infrastructure exceeded $19 million statewide, and the military base in Anchorage sustained an addition $3.5 million in flood damages.  There was one fatality associated with the flooding.  On September 24, a 51 year old man died while attempting to cross a swollen creek on his ATV.||In addition to flooding, the storms brought strong east and southeast wind to an area from southeast Prince William Sound, to Cordova, through Portage Pass, along Turnagain Arm and along the Anchorage.  The first strong storm resulted in wind through the Chugach Mountains with an unofficial peak wind of 120 mph measured by a spotters home weather system in Bear Valley.  In the other wind-prone locations, peak wind was generally around 70 to 75 mph, with 90 mph in reported in Portage Valley.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Susitna River at Sunshine crested at 27.66ft on 9/21/12 at 23:00 AKDT.

Due to the very humid and unstable nature of the atmosphere, the storms produced locally heavy rainfall with rain rates well in excess of one inch per hour. A Flash Flood Warning was issued at about 430 pm, which led to road closures west of El Centro, in the area near Seeley and Dixieland. Thunderstorms persisted into the evening, and additional rainfall led to areas of flooding along Interstate 8, Evan Hewes Highway and Highway 98. According to the California Highway Patrol, at approximately 9 pm flooding caused the closure of Interstate 8 in both directions between Drew Road and Dunaway Road. At 830 pm, local law enforcement reported the evacuation of 5 homes on Evan Hewes Highway due to a bank collapse along the Westside main canal. Heavy rain from earlier storms led to the collapse of the canal bank, and canal water then spread into the homes just west of Seeley. Overflow from the Westside canal eroded Evan Hewes Highway west of Westside road, and 100 feet of the highway were washed away. As a result, Evan Hewes Highway was closed from Dunaway to Westside road. In addition, Dunaway road was damaged beyond repair due to the flooding. Several minor injury traffic accidents were reported during the heavy rain and flooding, as rains limited visibility and made roads very slick. Finally, the breach of the canal resulted in no access to the Centinela State Prison. At 730 pm the Flash Flood Warning was replaced by an areal Flood Warning which continued through 430 am on July 31st.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 400.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These heavy rains, augmented by a December record 1.7 inches of precipitable water, developed along a stationary front that lay along but just north of the Ohio River from Cairo, IL to Cincinnati. These early rains, combined with thunderstorms during the afternoon and early evening, brought areal and river flooding to north central Kentucky. ||By early afternoon, low pressure deepened as it moved northeast across central Illinois and northern Indiana. Rains ceased by mid-day as central Kentucky fell within the warm sector of the developing cyclone. Record high temperatures in the lower 70s arrived by early evening.  A severe squall line developed by mid-afternoon from southern Illinois southwards along the Mississippi River. This line of storms, fueled by ample moisture and an exceptionally strong low level jet in excess of 50 kts, became severe as it moved across southern Indiana and central Kentucky during the evening hours. Three circulations within this line produced tornadoes across central Kentucky and the Bluegrass Region. For the Louisville weather office, these 3 December tornadoes were the first observed since 1971.

The parameters changed little from the previous event.  A weakly sheared atmosphere was in place with 25 to 30 kts of shear available.  CAPE values were slightly higher, in the 1000 to 2000 J/kg range.  Downdraft CAPE ranged from under 400 J/kg over the east part of the CWA to 800 J/kg over the west.  A substantial inversion was in place over most of the Des Moines CWA.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was relatively low, only 200 to 400 J/kg.  Precipitable water values were in the 1.3 to 1.6 inch range, or over 2 standard deviations above normal.  Thunderstorms from the previous night weakened, only to be replaced by a new round of thunderstorms that developed over northwest Iowa by mid day on the 26th.  These storms moved southeast across the state, producing heavy rain across many of the areas that received heavy rainfall the night before.  Highway closings were too numerous to mention with many small creeks overflowing their banks and causing flash flooding.  There were several reports of road washouts and bridges being washed out.  A man driving a SUV was swept away by swift flood waters Monday morning on Westbrook Street in Butler County west of Parkersburg.  Severe weather was limited.  The storms produced half dollar size hail in Taylor County.  Hail also fell in Humboldt and Polk Counties.  A funnel cloud was reported in Taylor County as well.  One brief tornado touchdown was reported southwest Diagonal in Ringgold County.  On the morning of the 27th, as the second MCS decayed, high winds occurred over a small part of north central into central Iowa as a wake low formed.

In addition, a weak stationary front stretched along the Front Range Foothills and Palmer Divide.  As a result, a prolonged period of moderate to heavy rain developed across the Front Range Foothills, Palmer Divide, Urban Corridor.  By the 14th, storm totals ranged from 6 to 18 inches, highest in the foothills of Boulder County.  The headwaters then moved down the South Platte River and caused widespread flooding with record flood stages at several locations as it made its way downstream into Nebraska.  Record high flood stages along the South Platte River were recorded at Balzac, Weldona and Julesburg.  As a result, widespread flooding occur along the South Platte for several days as the headwaters continued downstream, with much of the damage reported from Fort Morgan and Brush to around Sterling.  The floodwaters resulted in widespread evacuations.  Numerous water treatment facilities were contaminated and had to be shut down.  The headwaters remained at or above flood stage east of Sterling to Julesburg, but the flooding was not as widespread and the damage not as extensive. ||Initially, the showers that developed on the afternoon of the 11th were moving fast enough and were small enough to produce generally moderate rainfall amounts.   However, rain along the Front Range began to intensify and become more widespread in the evening. A narrow band of very heavy rain began to organize just north of Denver and move westward toward the foothills.  By 9 pm mdt on the 11th, heavy rain was becoming more widespread, with rainfall rates near 2 inches per hour in the heaviest showers.  From 10 pm mdt to Midnight mdt, very heavy rain locked itself in against the Front Range.  Flash flooding became more widespread, with several road closures from northwest Jefferson County northward through Boulder and Larimer Counties.  The heaviest rain in the foothills of Boulder, Larimer and northern Jefferson Counties finally began to abate, but widespread flash flooding continued due to the extremely heavy rainfall during the evening and early morning hours of the 12th.  Meanwhile, torrential rain redeveloped in southwest Weld, northeast Adams, eastern Denver and northwest Arapahoe Counties in the early morning hours of the 12th;  which impacted northeast Denver and Aurora.  ||Atypical for September in Colorado, 24-hour rainfall totals ending 7 am mdt on September 12th included 6.5 to 8.6 inches in Boulder; with 3 to 6.5 inches across the Larimer and Boulder County foothills, as well an area stretching from northeastern Metro Denver area into southwest Weld County.  By 9 am mdt, heavy rain and considerable flash flooding continued through the morning in the Aurora area.   Numerous streams remained at or above bankfull levels across Boulder, Larimer, and southwest Weld counties.  By the evening of the 12th, flooding continued in many areas and increased in severity. Heavy rain, while not as widespread as the previous day, had a greater impact on stream levels as streams were already elevated and the ground was completely saturated. Two peaks of flows occurred on Boulder Creek near downtown. The peak flow on the evening of September 12th surpassed the 1969 Boulder flood, but initial indications are that it fell short of the 1938 and 1894 floods.  Boulder Stream Gauge ���peak flows occurred near 0100 mdt on the 12th, and 2100 mdt on the 12th.   Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Big Thompson River,  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  The headwaters moved down the South Platte with floodwaters impacted Weld, Morgan, Washington and Logan Counties.  Extensive flooding occurred in and around Greeley, Fort Morgan and Sterling.  Large sections of the counties' roads and highways were washed away, with property and crops completely inundated.   ||After little rainfall on Friday, September 13th, the flash flood threat returned for  Saturday. This time, storms with heavy rainfall were concentrated in Douglas County, but also extended northeast into the Aurora area once again. Up to 3 inches of rain fell in one hour.  Plum Creek and other small creeks and streams flooded, along with significant street flooding.  The last day of this prolonged period of very heavy rainfall was on Sunday, September 15th. Another weak front had pushed through the area Saturday night, leaving the atmosphere unseasonably moist and unstable.  Heavy rain developed by mid morning and then became more widespread and peaked in intensity by the noon hour. This time, flash flooding was most significant in the northern portions of the Denver metro area from Northglenn to around Broomfield. Rain finally tapered off during the late afternoon and evening.||The devastating flood damage encompassed 4,500 square miles of the Colorado Front Range, left seven dead, forced thousands to evacuate, and destroyed thousands of homes and farms. Record amounts of rainfall generated flash floods that tore up roads and lines of communication, leaving many stranded.  Nearly 19,000 homes were damaged, and over 1,500 destroyed.  The Colorado Department of Transportation estimated that at least 30 state highway bridges were destroyed and an additional 20 seriously damaged. A preliminary assessment of the state's infrastructure showed damage of $40 million to roads and $112 million to bridges.  Repair costs for state and and county roads were likely to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Miles of freight and passenger rail lines were washed out or submerged, including a section servicing Amtrak's iconic California Zephyr.  The town of Lyons in Boulder County was isolated by the flooding of St. Vrain Creek, and several earth dams along the Front Range burst or were over-topped.   Floodwaters also swept through Estes Park, the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park and a major tourist attraction, and damaged hundreds of buildings and destroyed large sections of the two main roads that led into town; U.S. 34 from Loveland and U.S. 36 from Lyons/Boulder.  U.S. 34 suffered the most damage, with 85 percent of its roadway and bridges destroyed.   In Weld County, approximately 1,900 gas wells were damaged and had to be closed off as the floodwaters inundated entire communities. ||Sewage treatment plants and other utilities were knocked out in a number of towns,  and standing water left by floods on prairie farmlands posed the threat of significant damage to crops already planted in the region.  Northeast Colorado Health Department has advised with the local CSU Extension office in Logan County regarding local crops and gardens that had been exposed to flood waters.  As the flood waters in our area should be considered contaminated, local crops and gardens may not be considered suitable for human consumption or animal feed.  In the flooded areas, an estimated 23,000 acres of cropland was impacted and stretched from Boulder to Logan Counties and included:  alfalfa, corn, hay, silage and sugar beets.  The estimated loss of production ranged from $3.4 million to $5.5 million. ||Governor Hickenlooper declared a disaster emergency on September 13th, in 11 counties across northeast Colorado including:  Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Boulder, Denver, Jefferson, Larimer, Logan, Morgan, Washington and Weld.  By September 15th, federal emergency declarations covered those counties as well as Clear Creek County.  Projected losses from the flooding statewide was nearly $3 billion in property damage.  Half of the damage estimate was from housing and half from the commercial and government sectors, according to Eqecat, a catastrophe modeling firm; this was the first comprehensive estimate of the disaster's economic toll.  The projected losses for residential property alone were about $900 million.  Another $1 billion was attributed to commercial and goverment property, including roads and bridges.  In addition, more than 11 thousand people were evacuated, reportedly the largest since Hurricane Katrina.  President Obama declared a state of emergency for Boulder and Larimer Counties, with an additional 10 counties added September 16th including: Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Clear Creek, Denver, Jefferson, Morgan, Logan, Washington and Weld Counties.  The president also declared a major disaster specifically for Boulder County, which provided for federal recovery assistance. ||There were six fatalities directly attributed to flash flooding.  By county, those fatalities included 4 in Boulder County and 2 in Larimer County.  Two 19-yr old teenagers died on the evening of the 11th, after they were swept away by floodwaters after abandoning their vehicle on Lindon Drive in Boulder.  In Jamestown, a 72-yr old man was killed when the building he was in collapsed.  An 80-yr old Lyons resident was killed in the early morning hours of the 12th, when his truck was swept into the St. Vrain River near his home.   On the evening of the 12th, a 79-yr old Larimer County resident was killed when she was swept away while trying to climb to safety from her home in Cedar Point.   A 61-yr old Cedar Point resident died when her home was swept down the Big Thompson River by the floodwaters.  An indirect fatality occurred on the 16th.  An 80-yr old Idaho Springs resident drowned in Clear Creek when the embankment he was standing on collapsed.||Along the South Platte River, the crest of the flood at Kersey was near 18.8 feet on September 14th, which was significantly higher than the record crest of 11.73 feet set on May 8, 1973.   On September 15th, the flood crest was near 13.7 feet at Balzac which exceeded the record of 13.3 feet set on June 18, 1965.

This is the most precipitation ever recorded in Denver for the month of September.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rain, ranging from 6 to 18 inches through the storm event, caused widespread flooding along the entire drainage systems of Boulder and St. Vrain Creeks.  Three vehicles were partially submerged when floodwaters undercut Dillon Road near CO287, between Lafayette and Broomfield.  When the road first collapsed, several people were able to get out of the water quickly, but three were trapped in their vehicles and had to be rescued.  The three drivers were taken to local hospitals for treatment.  Extensive flooding was reported in Longmont and forced several road closures.  Floodwaters tipped over two storage tanks containing sulfuric acid at the Longmont Brewery.  Several shelters were set up for evacuees.

An unusually strong jet transported nearly historic amounts of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the region which pushed surface dew points to 60 degrees by Saturday evening. The warm air and strong winds aloft supported the growth of strong damaging storms and heavy rain. Most of the region measured between two to four inches of precipitation. The recently melted snow pack combined with runoff from the moderate to heavy rain that weekend resulted in widespread flooding with all rivers experiencing minor to major flooding.  A warm front lifted north across the area during the evening hours.  Strong to severe thunderstorms developed during the late evening hours of the 21st.  Severe weather continued into the early morning hours of the 22nd.  A lot of wind damage was produced by the severe thunderstorms.  The damage was especially bad across northern Richland County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Sandusky River at Tiffin came out of its banks after a heavy rain event on the 21st and 22nd.

The time of the flooding was estimated based on the stage at a nearby river.||The Greene County Daily World reported that a rural Bloomfield man drowned after he apparently slipped and fell into a flood-swollen creek in Taylor Township on the morning of April the 8th. The victim, 62, lived on the property where Bogard Creek flows on U.S. 231, south of Bloomfield. The Greene County Coroner said no foul play is indicated and it looks like the victim may have been walking along the creek bank and simply fell into the water. The exact time of the incident has not been determined, but his body was found at about 11:30 AM by two close friends who had come to check on the victim. The victim's body was in two to three feet deep water and had been retrieved from the water by the friends when authorities arrived at the site, which is located in Taylor Township between County Road 400 and County Road 600.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.10K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Rising river levels and ice jams led to flooding across portions of northern and eastern Maine. High temperatures on the 14th generally ranged from around 60 to the mid 60s north...to the mid 60s Downeast. These temperatures produced rapid snow melt which led to rising river and stream levels. The rising rivers caused ice to move which led to ice jams. Heavy rains then occurred across the region from the 15th into the 16th in advance of a cold front...with totals of 1.00 to 2.00 inches. Runoff from this rain...in addition to the melting snow...further contributed to rising river levels and ice jams.|River and stream flooding began to develop during the afternoon and evening of the 15th related to the rapid runoff due to snow melt and heavy rains along with ice jams. Runoff from fields and hills overwhelmed culverts and poor drainage areas which contributed to flooding and road closures along with the only fatality of the event. |Significant flooding across Piscataquis and Washington counties lasted into the afternoon of the 17th.

Heavy rain then occurred during the 15th in advance of a slow moving cold front along with continued mild temperatures which contributed to further runoff. Rainfall totals during the 15th generally ranged from 1.00 to 2.00 inches. |Flooding began to develop during the afternoon of the 15th due to rising river and stream levels along with ice jams. Additional flooding was due to runoff from fields and hills which overwhelmed culverts and produced standing water in poor drainage areas. Road closures due to both types of flooding began to develop during the afternoon of the 15th. The number of road closures then steadily increased across the entire county through the remainder of the 15th into the 16th...with numerous road closures persisting into the 18th. |Flooding occurred along portions of both the Aroostook River and Saint John River. Numerous roads were closed around Fort Fairfield...on the Aroostook River...starting on the afternoon of the 15th due to elevated river levels and several ice jams. The final ice jams released during the afternoon of the 16th allowing water levels to recede.  Several forecast points along the Aroostook River reached flood stage. An ice jam caused the river at Washburn to briefly spike above flood stage for around 2 hours during the overnight hours of the 15th into the 16th...cresting around 2.5 feet above flood stage. At Masardis...the river rose above flood stage during the early morning hours of the 16th...crested around a foot above flood stage that afternoon...then fell below flood stage later that evening. Elevated river levels and ice jams contributed to flooding along portions of the Saint John River. An ice jam affected the Saint Francis area during the morning of the 16th resulting in minor flooding. A more significant ice jam...estimated to be 3 to 4 miles long...then affected the Saint Francis area during the 17th into the early morning of the 18th before releasing. This ice jam closed portions of Route 161 between Saint Francis and Allagash due to water and large chunks of ice covering the road. This ice jam also caused the voluntary evacuation of 5 homes along the river for precautionary reasons. When this ice jam released the ice contributed to elevated river levels further downstream...from Hamlin to Van Buren...where portions of Route 1A were briefly closed. Many small streams also overflowed across the county contributing to flooding. Other towns affected by flooding and road closures included Bridgewater...Caribou...Castle Hill...Easton...Hodgdon...Houlton...Mapleton...Presque Isle...Westfield and Wytopitlock.  |Non river flooding also occurred across the region due to the runoff of heavy rain and snow melt from fields and hills. This runoff overwhelmed culverts which led to flooding and road closures...with flooding also occurring in poor drainage areas. The one fatality during this event was due to runoff from fields which had flooded a dirt road in the Caswell area. After moving his vehicle...the individual attempted to walk back across the flooded road and stepped into the fast moving water of a culvert which swept him away resulting in his drowning. This fatality occurred during the evening of the 15th. The monetary damage represents a total from 4 towns.
