The warm front continued to gradually mix north northwest into East Texas and Northcentral Louisiana by late morning and early afternoon hours, with a very warm, moist, and unstable air mass noted over Deep East Texas and portions of Northcentral Louisiana south of the front. Coupled with even stronger forcing and low level shear ahead of the approaching upper trough, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed near and south of the front from late morning through the afternoon, producing numerous reports of damaging winds with several tornadoes across portions of East Texas. These showers and thunderstorms diminished by early evening with the departure of the trough, and the arrival of an associated cold front which brought about cooler, drier, and more stable air southeast into the region.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tree fell on the vehicle in the 1800 block of Dewitt Henson Road near Pollok, killing an 8 year old boy and a 3 year old boy sitting in the backseat.

An organized line of severe thunderstorms formed over the central Plains states during the night of the 20th. This bowing line of storms progressed southeast across the St. Louis area during the midday hours, then down across the lower Ohio Valley and southeast Missouri during the afternoon. Large areas of wind damage were reported in parts of southeast Missouri. The atmosphere ahead of the storms became strongly unstable, with surface-based capes exceeding 4,000. Given the strong buoyancy, wind profiles were sufficiently strong for widespread severe weather. Deep-layer (0-6 km) wind shear values were no higher than about 30 knots, and 0-1 km shear was about 20 knots. Even though the region was under a broad 500 mb ridge, a moderately strong low-level feed of very moist and unstable air fueled the intense storms as they propagated southeastward.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Within the Ozark National Scenic Riverways, a tree fell on a boat on the Current River. The boat was traveling downstream in the vicinity of the Waymeyer Shute river access point. The 22-year-old male driver of the boat was killed, and two passengers in their 20's were moderately injured. The injured parties were from the local area and were treated at a local hospital. In the same general vicinity, trees and large tree limbs were down on the north end of M Highway.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An organized line of severe thunderstorms formed over the central Plains states during the night of the 20th. This bowing line of storms progressed southeast across the St. Louis area during the midday hours, then down across the lower Ohio Valley and southeast Missouri during the afternoon. Widespread wind damage was reported in parts of southern Illinois, especially in far southern areas from the Marion-Carbondale area southward to the Ohio River. Flash flooding was reported in a few locations. The atmosphere ahead of the storms became strongly unstable, with surface-based capes exceeding 4,000.

MUCAPE values very quickly approached and exceeded 4000 J/kg by mid-morning. With the cold front and previous storm outflows the impetus for new convection, discrete storms were not expected, with the prevailing storm type being the linear or quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) variety. Additional support for the QLCS mode was seen with, once again the cold frontal and outflow forcing, highly unstable atmosphere, and little to no convective inhibition.  Additional support for strong winds was seen with DCAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg across much of the area  Once a system began to produce a decent cold pool, there would be little to prevent it from progressing. ||That was evident in Iowa as two distinct QLCSs moved through. First in the morning hours across northern Iowa, and second during the late morning through evening hours from central Iowa and on toward south central and southeast Iowa. In both cases, damaging winds widely prevailed. Across northern Iowa the gust front roared out ahead of the line of convection, continuing to produce severe wind reports in areas of no storms well to the south and east. In central and southeast Iowa, widespread reports of 60 to 70 mph winds and various tree damage (from large limbs to entire trees) were received along a path from roughly Perry, IA through Ottumwa, IA.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Some inflatables were blown away from a town celebration.

With the cold front and previous storm outflows the impetus for new convection, discrete storms were not expected, with the prevailing storm type being the linear or quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) variety. Additional support for the QLCS mode was seen with, once again the cold frontal and outflow forcing, highly unstable atmosphere, and little to no convective inhibition.  Additional support for strong winds was seen with DCAPE values in excess of 1500 J/kg across much of the area  Once a system began to produce a decent cold pool, there would be little to prevent it from progressing. ||That was evident in Iowa as two distinct QLCSs moved through. First in the morning hours across northern Iowa, and second during the late morning through evening hours from central Iowa and on toward south central and southeast Iowa. In both cases, damaging winds widely prevailed. Across northern Iowa the gust front roared out ahead of the line of convection, continuing to produce severe wind reports in areas of no storms well to the south and east. In central and southeast Iowa, widespread reports of 60 to 70 mph winds and various tree damage (from large limbs to entire trees) were received along a path from roughly Perry, IA through Ottumwa, IA.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous tents on the fairgrounds were blown down with people in them causing some injuries.

The predominant weather revolved around damaging winds and heavy rainfall, though a few instances of severe hail and low end tornadoes were experienced as well. Among the reports, numerous trees were downed, buildings damaged or destroyed from straight line winds or one of the weak tornadoes, and numerous instances of 2 to 4 plus inches of heavy rainfall. ||On the setup side of the coin, a lot of factors were in line for the event to potentially be a sustained nocturnal severe weather event. The previous day, the 19th, saw surface high pressure begin to exit the region eastward and allowing southerly return flow to work into eastern Nebraska and western Iowa. Tied in with mid to upper 70 dew points and steep mid-level lapse rates, a large area of 4000 plus J/kg CAPE values developed across eastern Nebraska and western Iowa and slowly built eastward. Additionally, effect bulk shear was consistently in the 40 to 50 kt range and low level shear roughly oriented to expected storm motion. As the evening progressed and the low level jet finally began to ramp up, boosting warm air advection and positive moisture flux, storms began to develop and eventually congeal. Organization, at least with regards to strong to severe criteria, was not immediate, waiting until around 5am local time to produce its first severe report. Severe reports then continued as the system moved southeast over the next 4 plus hours.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Law enforcement reported a semi blown over on mile long bridge north of Knoxville, including a reported serious injury.

At least one fatality and one critical injury have been attributed to the remnants of Olga.||Tropical Storm Olga formed in the Gulf of Mexico Friday afternoon near the Louisiana coast. Olga then transitioned to a Post-Tropical Storm and merged with a cold front as it quickly lifted northeast through the Lower Mississippi River Valley on Saturday. As Olga���s remnants moved into the Mid-South, sustained winds of 30-40 mph were reported at several sites for up to an hour as the storm passed over. The first instance of damage occurred near Houston, Mississippi, where county-wide tree damage was observed. Widespread damage continued along a north-northeast track for nearly 150 miles as it moved through Mississippi and Tennessee. Numerous trees, power lines, and structures were damaged along the path, before Olga���s remnants moved east of the Tennessee River. Some of the most impressive winds were recorded at Tupelo Municipal Airport. Multiple wind gusts of 50-70 mph occurred for nearly 45 minutes as Olga moved through. The circulation maintained its intensity as it tracked north into Corinth, MS and eventually into Adamsville, TN, where some of the worst damage was observed. Winds were estimated to be in the 75-100 mph range. Damage continued through west Tennessee along the Tennessee River and eventually crossed over Interstate-40. Several semis were flipped along the interstate as winds remained very strong. Damage continued into Camden, Tennessee before crossing the Tennessee River.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Damaging straight line winds blew for 20-25 minutes across Lee County. The ASOS at the Tupelo airport measured a gust of 60 mph at 1046 am LST and then a 71 mph gust at 1108 am LST. Numerous trees were knocked down across the county. There was structural damage to the former Tupelo Automotive Museum and a local salon.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A few storms developed ahead of the approaching cold front in the late evening hours of the 20th, producing tornadoes in Dallas and surrounding areas. Additional storms formed a squall line along the cold front, producing a large swath of damaging winds across North and Central Texas overnight into the early hours of October 21st. A total of 10 tornadoes were identified by NWS Survey teams, occurring both within the storms ahead of the cold front, and embedded within the squall line. The strongest of these tornadoes was an EF-3 that stretched almost 16 miles across the northern portions of Dallas County. Following on the heels of that tornado, an EF-2 tracked about 2.5 miles through Garland in Dallas County. The remaining count of tornadoes included 4 EF-1s and 4 EF-0s. Miraculously, no one was killed or significantly injured in any of the tornadoes! The total estimated cost of insured damage for all the tornadoes alone is over $2 billion, which the Insurance Council of Texas claims is the most costly tornado event in the state's history. Of the straight line wind damage, the most severe was located in Farmersville in Collin Co where a mobile home was rolled and destroyed. Three people were injured in the home. Over a dozen other manufactured homes in the same area were damaged, too.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The same line of storms that produced the Allen tornado moved east and produced a brief downburst wind event east of Farmersville. Approximately 15 homes were damaged by straight line winds to the southeast of Farmersville on CR 697. One mobile home was rolled approximately 100 feet and destroyed, resulting in injuries to 3 of the occupants. Damage to the other homes in the area consisted primarily of minor roof damage and damage to underpinning.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The rainy weather pattern that dominated January and February became less active in March. The winter of 2018-19 ended up being the fourth wettest winter on record at Paducah, where records go back to 1937. February was the second wettest February on record at Paducah. Record rainfall in the Cumberland and Tennessee Valleys sent a large volume of water into Kentucky and Barkley Lakes. Both lakes crested around 367 feet, 8 feet above their summer pool stage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A prolonged major river flood that peaked in February subsided in March. Information on the February crest height and the total property damage estimate is contained in the February report. The flood damaged about 50 homes in McCracken County. Levee and flood wall gates were installed in the Paducah area. This action along with heavy rainfall in west Kentucky and backwater from the Ohio and Tennessee Rivers caused widespread flooding in the southeast part of McCracken County. Smaller rivers and creeks such as the Clarks River had nowhere to drain and kept rising with each successive round of heavy rain. One fatality occurred due to a vehicle that drove into Clarks River floodwaters. A male, age 59, drove around a barricade and into floodwaters off Highway 787 near the Marshall County line. His girlfriend escaped the vehicle, but he did not. His body was recovered and CPR was administered but to no avail. Countywide, a damage assessment indicated 35 residences sustained minor damage and 15 sustained major damage. Numerous roads were closed around the county, especially in the flood plain west of Paducah and the Clarks River basin in eastern McCracken County. Some of the largest state roads that were closed included Highway 131 south of Reidland, Highway 305 in West Paducah, and Highway 284 between Reidland and Paducah. A Red Cross shelter was opened in Paducah. The City of Paducah declared a state of emergency and installed most of the floodgates in the floodwall. The city's convention center was inaccessible for over a week due to its location outside the floodwall. A makeshift barrier was installed around the convention center to prevent flooding.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A cold front brought additional rainfall through the afternoon and evening, before drier conditions worked into eastern Kentucky during the morning of February 21. ||Rain quickly spread back north that evening into the 22nd with southeastern Kentucky continuing to see prolonged light rain into the afternoon of the 23rd. A cold front brought additional rain to much of eastern Kentucky late on the 23rd. ||A spike in moisture ahead of this front resulted in additional moderate to heavy rain and high rainfall rates across portions of eastern Kentucky late on the 23rd. The convection ahead of the cold front that evening resulted in the majority of the flooding and flash flooding issues across eastern Kentucky. Showers and thunderstorms capable of heavy rainfall trained over parts of Wayne, Pulaski, Rockcastle, and other counties along the I-75 corridor, resulting in deadly flash flooding and river flooding along the Cumberland River. Later in the evening, the bulk of the rainfall shifted north to counties along the Mountain Parkway. Flash flooding and river flooding occurred in Powell, Wolfe, Breathitt, Magoffin, and Johnson Counties. Lighter rainfall continued into the night as flooding issues remained widespread into the 24th.||Rainfall amounts from this event ranged from near 2 inches in portions of the Bluegrass region and northeast Kentucky, to greater than 4 inches across locations in southern and southeast Kentucky. ||This additional water on top of saturated ground continued to promote mud and rock slides across eastern Kentucky, complete with power outages from fallen debris and trees. Pikeville experienced a massive rockslide early on February 22, resulting in several cars and a building being damaged. Other impacts included countless roads being inundated with standing water, pavement and water pipes breaking, water threatening homes, roads and bridges being washed away, and rising lake levels.||Of the 33 counties across eastern Kentucky, at least 27 were forced to declare State of Emergencies due to rainfall during and before this event. This included Knott County due to over $150,000 in county road damages. Beattyville, Clay City, Harlan, Hazard, Jenkins, Monticello, Paintsville, Pikeville, Salyersville, Stanton, West Liberty, and Whitesburg also declared State of Emergencies. Additionally, the Kentucky Governor declared a State of Emergency across the entire Commonwealth.||The persistent rainfall of the winter season and the amount of rainfall from this event led to Lake Cumberland reporting their highest lake level of 756.52 feet on February 26th, breaking the old record of 751.69 feet dating back to May 1984. As a result, Wolf Creek Dam had to release at a record discharge level of 59,880 cubic feet per second. Cave Run Lake also rose to within 6 feet of their record pool elevation. Buckhorn Lake came within 10 feet of their all-time record, partially resulting in Kentucky Highway 257 near Confluence having flood waters cover the highway isolating 40 to 50 families for three weeks following the end of the flooding rains.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A local news media outlet reported that a motorist crashed into Wolf Creek off of Stidham Road south of Cinda. The driver's body was later found trapped inside the car. Additionally, a bystander also died as a result of the flooded creek after he jumped in to try to save the driver. The creek was 3 to 4 times higher than normal, contributing to the death of both men.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

From 4 to 15 inches of snow cover remained across the mid Missouri River valley, and the ground was frozen with existing frost depths of 15 to 23 inches. Warm temperatures allowed all of the snow to rapidly melt and record moisture allowed 1 to 2.5 inches of rain to fall over a 48 hour period.  Due to the frozen ground, and that 1 to 2 feet of thick ice remained in area rivers, widespread, and in many cases, catastrophic flooding developed. Due to expansive levee breaches on many rivers and streams, the flood damage was particularly devastating to many communities. Four individuals lost their lives due to the extreme conditions, and several hundred people required rescue via air or boat. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from their homes or businesses. Nearly 50 levees were breached on the Platte, Elkhorn and Missouri Rivers due to the large volume of water. One such levee breach along the Platte River near Leshara, Nebraska forced the evacuation of National Weather Service Omaha, located in Valley, Nebraska for 8 days. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts presented US$1.3 billion preliminary damage estimates for the entire state, including specific sector losses of: $439 million infrastructure (including roads and bridges), $85 million private homes and businesses, $400 million livestock and $440 million crop. About 2,000 miles of state roads including 15 Nebraska state highway bridges and numerous local bridges, roughly 20 percent of the entire state road system were impacted. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds provided a $1.6 billion preliminary damage estimate due to flooding across the state. U.S. Interstate 29, extending north-south along the Missouri River, was inundated and partially destroyed, as was the Interstate 680 bypass around Council Bluffs-Omaha metropolitan area. Also noteworthy was damage to Offutt Air Force Base located near Bellevue, Nebraska. One-third of the base���s main runway was inundated, along with one-third of Offutt���s buildings, with several hundred employees, and several families displaced. Preliminary damage estimates released by the Department of Defense are on the order of $450 million. Nebraska and Iowa severe flooding impacts culminated in Federal Disaster Declaration 4420.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is for flooding along the Loup River. The river gage at Columbus, operated by the Nebraska DNR, peaked at 19.39 feet at 5 am on March 15th. Major flood stage is 20 feet. Preliminary this peak is the 2nd highest on record. This flooding caused substantial damage to the area, specifically on the river side of the levee around Columbus. This damage was the result of both ice jam and open water flooding. Several businesses and homes were destroyed and many people needed to be rescued. The water got within 1 to 2 feet of the top of the levee and never got into Columbus.  One woman was killed by flood waters in her home.  Rescuers could not get to her home due to extreme weather conditions.  Property damage amounts represent amounts for the entire county.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 440.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Six to sixteen inches of rain fell between May 18th and May 30th along and northwest of a line from near Okmulgee, OK to near Bentonville, AR, and three to five inches of rain fell southeast of this line. Widespread ten to sixteen inch amounts fell across portions of southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma. During this period, six USACE Tulsa District flood control reservoirs set new pools of record in northeastern Oklahoma: Kaw, Keystone, Skiatook, Birch, Oologah, and Hudson Lakes.||The result was 31 river floods at 22 river forecast points in eastern Oklahoma.

Severe flooding occurred along the Arkansas River in Tulsa County, with some homes in south Tulsa and Bixby flooded. Riverside Drive in Tulsa was closed in places. A man fell into the river in Tulsa on the 26th, and another waded into the river. Both men drowned. Monetary damage from this flood is unknown.

About 2,000 miles of state roads including 15 Nebraska state highway bridges and numerous local bridges, roughly 20 percent of the entire state road system were impacted. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds provided a $1.6 billion preliminary damage estimate due to flooding across the state. U.S. Interstate 29, extending north-south along the Missouri River, was inundated and partially destroyed, as was the Interstate 680 bypass around Council Bluffs-Omaha metropolitan area. Also noteworthy was damage to Offutt Air Force Base located near Bellevue, Nebraska. One-third of the base���s main runway was inundated, along with one-third of Offutt���s buildings, with several hundred employees, and several families displaced.

Preliminary  informations shows this peak is the 3rd highest on record. Flooding also occurred along the Missouri River. The river gage at Nebraska City, operated by the USGS, peaked at 30.15 feet at 6 pm on March 16th. Minor flood stage is 18 feet, moderate flood stage is 23 feet while major flood stage is 27 feet. Preliminary data shows this to be a record crest. Flooding continued into the next month. Levees 601, 594 and 575 failed flooding Bartlett, Percival, Hamburg, and the truck stop area near Interstate 29. Dollar estimate is from the Army Corps of Engineers Omaha District. Hospitals and businesses were impacted by the flood.  Floods devastated livestock, grain storage, and fields that had yet to be planted.Water systems in Hamburg were incapacitated and overcome with high water. Three men were driving  in Hamburg and drove around a road closed barrieron the evening of the 15th. They continued driving until they hit flood water, where the current swept their vehicle away. The men tried to swim to safety. Two of the men were found holding onto trees in the floodwaters. The third was found in a ditch near a residence trying to get warm.

Coupled with even stronger forcing and low level shear ahead of the approaching upper trough, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed near and south of the front from late morning through the afternoon, producing several reports of damaging winds across portions of Northcentral Louisiana. These storms also produced locally heavy rainfall that led to instances of flash flooding, which resulted in two separate fatalities in Ouachita Parish. A 13 year old boy drowned in a drainage canal in the Bawcomville community during the heavy rains, and an 80 year old female drove past barricades on a closed road in Calhoun several hours after the heavy rains had ended, with her car becoming submerged in the flood waters. Unfortunately, she was unable to escape and drowned.  These showers and thunderstorms diminished by early evening with the departure of the trough, and the arrival of an associated cold front which brought about cooler, drier, and more stable air southeast into the region.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An 80 year old female drove past barricades on Golson Rd. south of I-20 in Calhoun. The road had residual flooding from previous flash flooding earlier in the day. The vehicle became submerged by the flood waters, and the driver was unable to escape and drowned.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A few of these thunderstorms became strong enough to produce damaging wind gusts. One storm even produced a brief tornado after interacting with a mesoscale boundary.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service storm survey team confirmed an EF-1 tornado in Chatham County. The tornado began over the Wilmington River, just west of the Savannah Yacht Club on Whitemarsh Island. It developed rapidly as it hit the Savannah Yacht Club. At the time the tornado struck, a boat was being lifted by a crane at the dock. This boat was thrown from the crane back into the water. The boat crane was also pushed by the winds of the tornado off its track, which caused it to crash into a small building near the crane. This small building sustained significant roof damage. One person was reportedly injured inside the building, but the extent of their injuries was unknown. The tornado continued moving east-southeast , snapping and uprooting several trees in a residential area near the end of Bradley Creek Drive. One home in that area also had minor roof damage due to missing shingles. From this point, the tornado strengthened as it moved southeast over Bradley Creek and across portions of Turners Rock Road. This was the region where the most significant damage was found, with at least two dozen large hard and softwood trees either snapped or uprooted. Wind speeds in this area were estimated to be between 100 and 105 mph. The tornado then weakened as it moved on a more easterly path across Turner Creek and onto the western edge of Wilmington Island, just south of Johnny Mercer Boulevard. The tornado broke some tree limbs and branches around Walgreens, then damaged a sign near the Autoplex as it crossed Johnny Mercer Boulevard. Once across Johnny Mercer Boulevard, the weakening tornado skipped over Molly McGuire's restaurant, finally ending in the empty lot just east of the Goodwill store. The roof on the Goodwill store sustained minor damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A few of these thunderstorms became strong enough to produce damaging wind gusts. One storm even produced a brief tornado after interacting with a mesoscale boundary.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service storm survey team confirmed an EF-1 tornado in Chatham County. The tornado began over the Wilmington River, just west of the Savannah Yacht Club on Whitemarsh Island. It developed rapidly as it hit the Savannah Yacht Club. At the time the tornado struck, a boat was being lifted by a crane at the dock. This boat was thrown from the crane back into the water. The boat crane was also pushed by the winds of the tornado off its track, which caused it to crash into a small building near the crane. This small building sustained significant roof damage. One person was reportedly injured inside the building, but the extent of their injuries was unknown. The tornado continued moving east-southeast , snapping and uprooting several trees in a residential area near the end of Bradley Creek Drive. One home in that area also had minor roof damage due to missing shingles. From this point, the tornado strengthened as it moved southeast over Bradley Creek and across portions of Turners Rock Road. This was the region where the most significant damage was found, with at least two dozen large hard and softwood trees either snapped or uprooted. Wind speeds in this area were estimated to be between 100 and 105 mph. The tornado then weakened as it moved on a more easterly path across Turner Creek and onto the western edge of Wilmington Island, just south of Johnny Mercer Boulevard. The tornado broke some tree limbs and branches around Walgreens, then damaged a sign near the Autoplex as it crossed Johnny Mercer Boulevard. Once across Johnny Mercer Boulevard, the weakening tornado skipped over Molly McGuire's restaurant, finally ending in the empty lot just east of the Goodwill store. The roof on the Goodwill store sustained minor damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A deep tap of subtropical moisture surged north into the state ahead of this system on March 12th as a surface low deepened over northeastern New Mexico. Widespread showers and thunderstorms with locally heavy rainfall moved through the entire area on the 12th while heavy snow fell in the mountains above 9,000 feet. Abundant moisture and instability in place over eastern New Mexico led to the development of a large line of showers and thunderstorms with hail, damaging winds, and even a damaging EF-2 tornado in Chaves County. This was the first March tornado documented in Chaves County since 1959, and the earliest known EF-1 of stronger tornado in the state of New Mexico. Six people were injured and dozens of homes and structures were damaged or destroyed. A powerful Pacific cold front then blasted through the state on March 13th as bombogenesis took place along the Front Range of Rockies. Surface low pressure deepened over 24 millibars in 24 hours to record low values for a few sites within New Mexico and Kansas. The combination of a very intense surface pressure gradient and powerful jet stream winds aloft forced widespread strong to damaging winds across much of New Mexico. Peak wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph were common across eastern New Mexico, with sustained wind speeds between 40 and 60 mph for several hours. A large cargo train was blown off a bridge near Logan, completely destroying all 26 cars. Several high profile vehicles were also overturned on Interstate 25, Interstate 40, and U.S. Highway 285. Trees, power lines, and roofs were damaged in many other areas of the state. Snow continued to pile up in the higher terrain through the night of the 13th where storm total snowfall accumulations ranged from 20 to 40 inches.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Just before 6 pm MDT on Tuesday, March 12, 2019, a tornado touched down in Chaves County, about 15 miles south southwest of Dexter. The tornado moved north northeast for approximately 15 minutes before dissipating about one half mile northeast of the community of Dexter. Six people suffered minor injuries, and six homes were substantially damaged or completely destroyed. An additional dozen homes and structures also sustained minor to moderate damage. This was the first March tornado documented in Chaves County since 1959, and the earliest known EF1 or stronger tornado in the state of New Mexico. The last EF2 tornado in New Mexico occurred on May 23, 2012. Damage amounts are a rough estimate.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A deep tap of subtropical moisture surged north into the state ahead of this system on March 12th as a surface low deepened over northeastern New Mexico. Widespread showers and thunderstorms with locally heavy rainfall moved through the entire area on the 12th while heavy snow fell in the mountains above 9,000 feet. Abundant moisture and instability in place over eastern New Mexico led to the development of a large line of showers and thunderstorms with hail, damaging winds, and even a damaging EF-2 tornado in Chaves County. This was the first March tornado documented in Chaves County since 1959, and the earliest known EF-1 of stronger tornado in the state of New Mexico. Six people were injured and dozens of homes and structures were damaged or destroyed. A powerful Pacific cold front then blasted through the state on March 13th as bombogenesis took place along the Front Range of Rockies. Surface low pressure deepened over 24 millibars in 24 hours to record low values for a few sites within New Mexico and Kansas. The combination of a very intense surface pressure gradient and powerful jet stream winds aloft forced widespread strong to damaging winds across much of New Mexico. Peak wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph were common across eastern New Mexico, with sustained wind speeds between 40 and 60 mph for several hours. A large cargo train was blown off a bridge near Logan, completely destroying all 26 cars. Several high profile vehicles were also overturned on Interstate 25, Interstate 40, and U.S. Highway 285. Trees, power lines, and roofs were damaged in many other areas of the state. Snow continued to pile up in the higher terrain through the night of the 13th where storm total snowfall accumulations ranged from 20 to 40 inches.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Just before 6 pm MDT on Tuesday, March 12, 2019, a tornado touched down in Chaves County, about 15 miles south southwest of Dexter. The tornado moved north northeast for approximately 15 minutes before dissipating about one half mile northeast of the community of Dexter. Six people suffered minor injuries, and six homes were substantially damaged or completely destroyed. An additional dozen homes and structures also sustained minor to moderate damage. This was the first March tornado documented in Chaves County since 1959, and the earliest known EF1 or stronger tornado in the state of New Mexico. The last EF2 tornado in New Mexico occurred on May 23, 2012. Damage amounts are a rough estimate.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Minor roof damage to a nearby two story home also occurred.  As the tornado tracked northeast across the eastern side of downtown Columbus, MS, it became evident that the storm had grown in strength a bit as streets became littered with uprooted and snapped hardwood and softwood trees, many of which had fallen on homes, causing significant roof damage. As the tornado moved along 9th street and College Street, damage was noted on top of a cell tower, where portions of the metal structure was evidently bent. By the time the tornado reached 12th Street and 4th Avenue, more extensive damage was noted by way of a brick fence along a single family home getting almost completely destroyed and additional snapped and uprooted hardwood trees.  Wooden power lines were snapped near or at its base at 12th Street and 4th Avenue, where portions of the roof was loss at the nearby Canterbury Townhouses. Littered downed and snapped trees falling on top of homes persisted along the northeast side of downtown Columbus, and southward facing homes along Railroad Street had windows that were blown out. As the tornado continued along its northeast path, it intersected the Hunt Intermediate School along 10th Avenue and 20th Street resulting in significant damage to the roof, and blown out windows along the second floor. Across the street, the Park and Rec Center and Activities Center composed of metal and tin were blown in/collapsed on its entry side. Damage continued along Tuscaloosa Road by way of fence damage along the outskirts of a Loves Truck Stop and snapped softwood and hardwood trees behind the Loves Truck Stop.  The First Pentecostal Church along Tuscaloosa Road had half of its tin roof blown off, and thus resulted in damage done to the inside of its worship area. At the intersection of Tuscaloosa Road and Conway Road, several manufactured buildings had most of its exterior walls and roofs caved in. The one fatality occurred at the intersection of Tuscaloosa Road and Gardner Street, where a structural sound brick building collapsed and the majority of the exterior walls were destroyed.  This tornado began to weaken as it neared the Alabama state line, as several softwood medium size tree limbs and snapped softwood trees occurred north of Highway 50.

The tornado tracked within a couple of miles either side of U.S. Highway 62 for most of its path in McCracken County. The tornado intermittently reached EF-2 intensity from the Ballard County line to about two miles southeast of Barkley Regional Airport. A total of 25 dwellings were damaged along the path in McCracken County. Five businesses were damaged, and 20 residences were damaged. The damage was categorized as minor for 14 of the residences, major for one, and five were destroyed. Major structural damage included partial loss of roofs or walls. Minor damage to homes included the loss of shingles. Dozens of barns, outbuildings, garages, or grain bins were destroyed.  A church, located on U.S. Highway 62 near Highway 305, lost much of the roof structure as well as a large part of a second story exterior wall. This is where the tornado reached its maximum intensity, with estimated peak winds near 125 mph. A total of 40 pre-schoolers were inside a day care facility in the church, but none were directly injured. At least ten vehicles sustained damage in this area near the church. The only injury occurred on U.S. Highway 62 near the church, where a grain bin was blown on top of a pickup truck traveling eastbound. During the final few miles of its track, the tornado weakened as it moved through the western part of the city of Paducah. In the western part of Paducah, the tornado moved across U.S. Highway 60 and the city's main shopping mall. The tornado dissipated shortly after crossing Interstate 24 between exits 3 and 4. The roofs of the shopping mall and a nearby strip mall were damaged. Several businesses in the mall area and along Interstate 24 sustained minor damage, mostly to roofs. Windows were blown out of vehicles and buildings. A moving semi truck was lifted along Interstate 24 and was blown into the median in a jack-knife position. Along the entire track, dozens of utility poles were down, causing extensive power outages for nearly 10,000 customers. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted. Video of the tornado was captured by personnel at the Paducah National Weather Service office, which the tornado missed by about two miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Along the entire track, dozens of utility poles were down, causing extensive power outages for nearly 10,000 customers. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted. Video of the tornado was captured by personnel at the Paducah National Weather Service office, which the tornado missed by about two miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As favorable upper-level support and deep-layer forcing approached the lower Mississippi River Valley, a surface low pressure developed and moved northeastward into Central Alabama by late morning. Ahead of this surface low, a warm front initially along the Florida Panhandle moved northward allowing for the transport of warm, moist unstable air into southern and southeastern Central Alabama. This frontal boundary eventually became more stationary and stalled out north of the I-85 corridor as the strengthening surface low moved eastward. During this time, a large area of elevated thunderstorms affected portions northern Central Alabama while supercell thunderstorms initiated across the favorable warm sector. As these supercells intensified during the afternoon, parameters became favorable for tornadic thunderstorms in an area along and south of the I-85 corridor.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in far southern Lee County and determined that it was consistent with an EF4 tornado, with maximum sustained winds near 170 mph.||This track is a continuation of a track that began in Macon County. The tornado crossed into Lee County near Lee Road 812 and tracked northeast to County Road 29 where it removed the roof and collapsed several cinder block walls of a church. The tornado continued to intensify as it approached County Road 11, where it peeled sheet metal off of the porch of a home and ripped some sheet metal off of two outdoor storage sheds and continued to uproot numerous pine trees. Debris from structures and their contents were strewn along a tree line to the east of their original location and some evidence of weak ground rowing was observed along the surface tornado path.||The tornado reached its peak intensity just south of the intersection of Lee County Road 36 and Lee County Road 39, where it rolled a manufactured home and emptied its contents nearby on the northern side of the track. Additional damage toward the southern portion of the track included the complete destruction of a house with all debris tossed a short distance from the foundation. The tornado bent the frame of a car around the remnant of a large tree whose upper portion had broken off and totaled three vehicles by severe impacts into the bases of two remaining tree stubs. Farther east on the other side of a small lake, a well-anchored and constructed home was leveled with debris removed from the foundation and anchored bolt screws remaining intact. Toward the northern edge of the tornado, the destruction of two double-wide and a single-wide manufactured home was observed. This was the peak intensity of the tornado due to the combination of damage to the two houses along with extensive severe tree damage including trees snapped at their bases and large trees with expansive root systems uprooted along with some sporadic evidence of ground rowing.||The tornado began to decrease in intensity as it continued east roughly paralleling Lee County Road 39 where two manufactured homes were destroyed with most debris deposited away from the original location and both of the metal frames of the mobile homes could not be located. Another manufactured home was destroyed with its contents deposited in a swath from the site into the remains of a nearby tree line. A car was found in an overturned position against a hardy tree stripped of most limbs with a mattress from a bed wrapped around the mid portion of the tree. A badly mangled metal frame of a manufactured home and debris displaced nearby was all that remained of one residence. Nearby a tractor trailer rig was on its side and shoved around a sturdy tree while a nearby site-built home lost nearly all of its exterior walls with debris remaining on or near the home site. Severe tree destruction continued in this area with trees snapped at their bases and uprooted. To the north of Lee County Road 39, significant debris was deposited in a wooded area where the tornado performed significant timber damage and toppled at least one high-tension power line tower.||After demolishing two double-wide and a single-wide manufactured home the tornado tracked northeast and crossed Lee County Road 51 just north of the intersection with Lee County Road 39. A double-wide manufactured home was moved off of its base and the exterior walls collapsed on a family residence along with significant tree damage.|Some weakening occurred farther east as the tornado crossed Lee County Road 38 where it deposited a large amount of debris into a ragged forested area. The tornado crossed Lee County Road 100 and Lee County Road 166 where it caused damage to trees with some trunks snapped and some trees uprooted.||Tornado damage was observed along Lee County Road 165 and along portions of Lee County Road 40 and Lee County Road 2049. Exterior walls of a family residence were removed and a significant loss of roofing material from a house and a manufactured home were observed. The tornado flipped a manufactured home and deposited its contents nearby along with destroying the roof and walls of a single-wide manufactured home.||The tornado crossed Lee County Road 170 and County Road 175, and then Highway 169 with significant damage to timber along this path. The tornado crossed Lee County Road 245 and Lee County Road 179 with damage to the roof of a house near County Road 239 along with more timber damage. As it approached Smiths Station, the tornado crossed Fullers Lake where it rolled a manufactured home and caused some loss of roofing material to a house. Additional damage occurred along Lee County Road 294 and Lee County Road 298 where a professional building lost some of its roofing materials. Damage also occurred to siding and roofing at several small homes that were not well constructed. As the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 280 it caused some roof damage to a restaurant, damaged a billboard and collapsed a cellular service communications tower. The tornado moved across Lee County Road 318 where some roof damage to homes occurred along with significant timber damage. The tornado moved tracked towards the Chattahoochee River where it caused roof damage to some houses near the river and downed a metal high-tension power line tower. The tornado crossed the Chattahoochee River and continued into Georgia.||There were 23 fatalities and 90 injuries. The American Red Cross estimated 225 homes were destroyed, while another 133 homes sustained major damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As favorable upper-level support and deep-layer forcing approached the lower Mississippi River Valley, a surface low pressure developed and moved northeastward into Central Alabama by late morning. Ahead of this surface low, a warm front initially along the Florida Panhandle moved northward allowing for the transport of warm, moist unstable air into southern and southeastern Central Alabama. This frontal boundary eventually became more stationary and stalled out north of the I-85 corridor as the strengthening surface low moved eastward. During this time, a large area of elevated thunderstorms affected portions northern Central Alabama while supercell thunderstorms initiated across the favorable warm sector. As these supercells intensified during the afternoon, parameters became favorable for tornadic thunderstorms in an area along and south of the I-85 corridor.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in far southern Lee County and determined that it was consistent with an EF4 tornado, with maximum sustained winds near 170 mph.||This track is a continuation of a track that began in Macon County. The tornado crossed into Lee County near Lee Road 812 and tracked northeast to County Road 29 where it removed the roof and collapsed several cinder block walls of a church. The tornado continued to intensify as it approached County Road 11, where it peeled sheet metal off of the porch of a home and ripped some sheet metal off of two outdoor storage sheds and continued to uproot numerous pine trees. Debris from structures and their contents were strewn along a tree line to the east of their original location and some evidence of weak ground rowing was observed along the surface tornado path.||The tornado reached its peak intensity just south of the intersection of Lee County Road 36 and Lee County Road 39, where it rolled a manufactured home and emptied its contents nearby on the northern side of the track. Additional damage toward the southern portion of the track included the complete destruction of a house with all debris tossed a short distance from the foundation. The tornado bent the frame of a car around the remnant of a large tree whose upper portion had broken off and totaled three vehicles by severe impacts into the bases of two remaining tree stubs. Farther east on the other side of a small lake, a well-anchored and constructed home was leveled with debris removed from the foundation and anchored bolt screws remaining intact. Toward the northern edge of the tornado, the destruction of two double-wide and a single-wide manufactured home was observed. This was the peak intensity of the tornado due to the combination of damage to the two houses along with extensive severe tree damage including trees snapped at their bases and large trees with expansive root systems uprooted along with some sporadic evidence of ground rowing.||The tornado began to decrease in intensity as it continued east roughly paralleling Lee County Road 39 where two manufactured homes were destroyed with most debris deposited away from the original location and both of the metal frames of the mobile homes could not be located. Another manufactured home was destroyed with its contents deposited in a swath from the site into the remains of a nearby tree line. A car was found in an overturned position against a hardy tree stripped of most limbs with a mattress from a bed wrapped around the mid portion of the tree. A badly mangled metal frame of a manufactured home and debris displaced nearby was all that remained of one residence. Nearby a tractor trailer rig was on its side and shoved around a sturdy tree while a nearby site-built home lost nearly all of its exterior walls with debris remaining on or near the home site. Severe tree destruction continued in this area with trees snapped at their bases and uprooted. To the north of Lee County Road 39, significant debris was deposited in a wooded area where the tornado performed significant timber damage and toppled at least one high-tension power line tower.||After demolishing two double-wide and a single-wide manufactured home the tornado tracked northeast and crossed Lee County Road 51 just north of the intersection with Lee County Road 39. A double-wide manufactured home was moved off of its base and the exterior walls collapsed on a family residence along with significant tree damage.|Some weakening occurred farther east as the tornado crossed Lee County Road 38 where it deposited a large amount of debris into a ragged forested area. The tornado crossed Lee County Road 100 and Lee County Road 166 where it caused damage to trees with some trunks snapped and some trees uprooted.||Tornado damage was observed along Lee County Road 165 and along portions of Lee County Road 40 and Lee County Road 2049. Exterior walls of a family residence were removed and a significant loss of roofing material from a house and a manufactured home were observed. The tornado flipped a manufactured home and deposited its contents nearby along with destroying the roof and walls of a single-wide manufactured home.||The tornado crossed Lee County Road 170 and County Road 175, and then Highway 169 with significant damage to timber along this path. The tornado crossed Lee County Road 245 and Lee County Road 179 with damage to the roof of a house near County Road 239 along with more timber damage. As it approached Smiths Station, the tornado crossed Fullers Lake where it rolled a manufactured home and caused some loss of roofing material to a house. Additional damage occurred along Lee County Road 294 and Lee County Road 298 where a professional building lost some of its roofing materials. Damage also occurred to siding and roofing at several small homes that were not well constructed. As the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 280 it caused some roof damage to a restaurant, damaged a billboard and collapsed a cellular service communications tower. The tornado moved across Lee County Road 318 where some roof damage to homes occurred along with significant timber damage. The tornado moved tracked towards the Chattahoochee River where it caused roof damage to some houses near the river and downed a metal high-tension power line tower. The tornado crossed the Chattahoochee River and continued into Georgia.||There were 23 fatalities and 90 injuries. The American Red Cross estimated 225 homes were destroyed, while another 133 homes sustained major damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This resulted in an increase in scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms near and south of the warm front from the late evening hours of the 24th through the early morning hours of the 25th across East Texas and North Louisiana. Coupled with the strong wind shear present across the expanding warm sector, several supercell thunderstorms developed, with one supercell spawning six separate tornadoes from San Augustine Texas northeast to Eastern Union Parish Louisiana, directly impacting the cities of San Augustine Texas and Ruston Louisiana along its 150+ mile track across the NWS Shreveport County Warning Area. In fact, this supercell spawned another tornado across Northwest Morehouse and Southern Ashley County Arkansas, to complete its nearly 180 mile track before dissipating. Other isolated supercells developed near and south of the warm front which spawned tornadoes across Northern Caddo Parish and Central La Salle Parish in Northern Louisiana, with other severe thunderstorms producing damaging winds across portions of Northcentral Louisiana as well, before the storms exited the region around daybreak on the 25th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF-3 tornado with maximum estimated winds near 145 mph touched down just northeast of the intersection of Highway 80 and Highway 818 where several trees were uprooted. It continued northeast, crossing South Maple Street where the tornado intensified, resulting in widespread tree damage just south of Highway 3012 along Wade Drive, Lind Drive, Robert Street, University Boulevard, and Shelor Drive. Many of these streets were impassable due to the significant number of trees snapped, twisted, and uprooted. Many more trees were downed on Highway 3012 before the tornado tracked northeast towards Westwood Drive. It uprooted a number of trees onto fraternity houses before it crossed the Kansas City Southern Railroad. The tornado crossed the railroad and bent or uprooted several large light poles on Louisiana Tech's softball, baseball, and neighboring athletic fields. It snapped a number of power poles as well. The tornado crossed Tech Drive and damaged a number of dormitories where it removed their metal roofs and blew out windows. It continued northeast where it uprooted more trees on Louisiana Tech's and Ruston High School's campuses. The estimated winds as the tornado tore through the western and northern sections of Louisiana Tech University ranged from 115-130 mph. The tornado crossed Greenwood Cemetery where it intensified again, resulting in a large number of trees being debarked with just the stubs of the large branches remaining in several areas. It continued with several business sustaining significant damage to their exterior brick walls and some interior walls. A hotel along Interstate 20 suffered the collapse of its top story's exterior walls. The tornado continued on to severely damage a gas station between Trenton and Vienna Streets just south of I-20, before crossing the interstate and weakened slightly but still resulted in considerable roof damage to several businesses along North Service Road East. The tornado then began to weaken, with more sporadic wind damage noted as it moved northeast towards Farmerville Highway. It crossed Farmerville Highway near Timberline Court uprooting a number of trees and continued northeast towards Haddox Road. The tornado then lifted and touched back down a few more times with the intermittent damage noted for the rest of its path. It uprooted a few more trees along Stable and Baxter Roads, destroyed a chicken house along Highway 820, before finally lifting just south of Oak Tree Road. The tornado resulted in two fatalities when a tree fell through their home, killing a 35 year old female and her 14 year old son just south of Interstate 20 in Ruston.||The Louisiana State Fire Marshal concluded that 22 buildings were destroyed by the tornado, 154 buildings sustained major damage, with 254 buildings receiving minor damage in the city of Ruston. The Louisiana Tech University campus had 16 buildings that could not be occupied, with the softball, baseball, and soccer fields, as well as 2 dormitories, suffering major damage.

As favorable upper-level support and deep-layer forcing approached the lower Mississippi River Valley, a surface low pressure developed and moved northeastward into Central Alabama by late morning. Ahead of this surface low, a warm front initially along the Florida Panhandle moved northward allowing for the transport of warm, moist unstable air into southern and southeastern Central Alabama. This frontal boundary eventually became more stationary and stalled out north of the I-85 corridor as the strengthening surface low moved eastward. During this time, a large area of elevated thunderstorms affected portions northern Central Alabama while supercell thunderstorms initiated across the favorable warm sector. As these supercells intensified during the afternoon, parameters became favorable for tornadic thunderstorms in an area along and south of the I-85 corridor.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in far southern Lee County and determined that it was consistent with an EF1 tornado, with maximum sustained winds near 105 mph.||This tornado was a continuation of the Macon County Tornado. The tornado entered Lee County about 1.2 miles north of Highway 80. It traveled northeast and crossed County Road 29, County Road 11, Cave Mill Road, and Alabama Highway 51. It continued northeast across County Road 166, County Road 165, and finally lifted near County Road 170. Numerous trees were snapped off and uprooted across southern Lee County. Many mobile homes and frame homes suffered varying degrees of roof damage. Two mobile homes were rolled over near the end of the damage path and one person was injured.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado touched down at a chemical plant and lifted a single wide office trailer, snapping the buried metal tie downs. The trailer was moved 50 feet away, where it landed on several parked vehicles. The roof and 3 walls of the trailer were removed. Two employees and three contractors that were inside the trailer when the tornado struck were injured. Officials at the plant stated that the trailer was installed in February of this year. The tornado continued northeast for 1.5 miles, snapping and uprooting at least 10 power poles before it lifted near New River.

A concrete table was moved several feet from its original position, and there was also minor small tree damage. In the service station at the intersection of US 40 and Hayes Arboretum Rd, an adult and a child were sitting in a car when the windows were blown in, causing minor injuries. They were taken to the hospital, treated and released.||Further northeast along Woodside Drive, a large hardwood tree fell to the southwest onto a house and also a tall metal television antenna fell the opposite direction onto the house. Extensive tree damage was also observed near the house, with several two foot diameter trees blown down. Debris from the signage of businesses was scattered throughout the property on Woodside Drive.||The property next door also experienced some damage, particularly with the garage being shifted and a tree limb also knocked down onto the house.

Two trees were snapped along South 37th Street.||The tornado then moved north-northeast, producing damage at the Brookdale Nursing Home on South A Street. Five to ten percent of the roof was removed. One tree, four inches in diameter, was knocked down and several smaller limbs from trees were also knocked down.||The most significant damage was observed at the Richmond Mall where several air handlers on the roof were removed and one was blown northeast onto U.S. 40. The parking lot was also full of debris and a large store on the southwest side of the mall had fifty percent of the glass blown in. On the east side of the mall, a brick wall seven feet high by thirty feet long was destroyed and some of the facade was starting to peel away from the roof. Around that same area, a garage door was blown in. Overall less than five percent of the roof of the mall was removed. On the inside of the mall approximately eight businesses experienced damage, primarily from windows blown out and merchandise blown around. Winds at the Richmond Mall were estimated to be around 85 mph, which is rated at the highest end for an EF0 tornado.||Some of the roof material from the mall landed in three to five businesses on the other side of US 40. Those businesses also received minor damage, with isolated windows being blown out and also some observed damage to signage and siding. A concrete table was moved several feet from its original position, and there was also minor small tree damage. In the service station at the intersection of US 40 and Hayes Arboretum Rd, an adult and a child were sitting in a car when the windows were blown in, causing minor injuries. They were taken to the hospital, treated and released.||Further northeast along Woodside Drive, a large hardwood tree fell to the southwest onto a house and also a tall metal television antenna fell the opposite direction onto the house. Extensive tree damage was also observed near the house, with several two foot diameter trees blown down. Debris from the signage of businesses was scattered throughout the property on Woodside Drive.||The property next door also experienced some damage, particularly with the garage being shifted and a tree limb also knocked down onto the house. Further down along Woodside Drive, several large tree limbs were knocked down.

Numerous trees in this area, with trunk diameters of 18 to 24 inches, were also snapped and blown down in various directions. This type of damage was consistent with wind speeds of up to 90 mph and associated with an EF1 tornado. ||The next damage occurred to homes and adjacent outbuildings along Mud Pike Road, immediately southeast of the intersection with State Route 118. Two homes retained their main roof structure but many shingles were removed. Two outbuildings and a larger barn were destroyed, likely resulting from EF1 tornado winds of 100 to 110 mph. Additional damage occurred along Hellwarth Road, just south of the intersection with Fairground Road. Several homes and outbuildings were damaged, with the most serious being a home that lost much of its roof and some exterior walls. High-end EF2 tornado winds of 125 to 135 mph likely caused the worst damage at this location. ||The tornado path continued generally along Fairground Road from just east of the intersection with Hellwarth Road to the western corporation limit of the city of Celina. Homes, outbuildings, trees and utility poles were damaged here, and a free-standing cellular communication tower was knocked down. At least two homes suffered partial roof loss and one home lost its entire roof. The cellular tower was a lattice structure at least 300 feet tall and two of the three support attachments at the ground were broken. A 50 to 100 yard swath of trees were snapped and uprooted in a forested area leading up to the western edge of Celina. The damage to the cellular tower and trees was indicative of EF2 tornado wind speeds of 125 to 135 mph. ||More substantial damage was observed just inside the western corporation limit of the city of Celina, along Fairground Road. At least a dozen homes were severely damaged here, with roofs completely uplifted and removed, along with many exterior walls collapsed. One residence was completely lifted from its foundation, with interior walls largely intact, and dropped in an adjoining field approximately 70 yards to the north-northeast. This residence was anchored to a cinder block foundation, with the upper level or two of blocks breaking from the rest under the force of the wind. Significant mud spatter was also observed on what remained of these homes, especially on the north and northeast facing sides, implying a strongly rotating column of air in contact with a nearby muddy field. This type of damage was consistent with wind speeds up to 150 mph and associated with an EF3 tornado. In this area along Fairground Road, a vehicle was thrown into a house, killing a person inside of the house. ||Significant damage continued into a cluster of homes near and northwest of the intersection of Fairground Road and Touvelle Street in Celina. At least two dozen of these homes had partial or complete roof failure and many exterior walls collapsed. Two residences on either side of Jill Avenue were missing large portions of their exterior walls, indicative of winds as high as 140 to 150 mph and associated with an EF3 tornado. Evidence of multiple vortices within the tornado was also evident in the debris pattern here. Several cars were displaced by the wind and uplift in this neighborhood. A thick layer of mud was also spattered on the east and northeast facing sides of these structures, largely opposite the direction of the incoming tornado. ||The degree and extent of damage started to gradually lessen east-northeast from near Touvelle Street to U.S. 127. From there the tornado continued to track farther northeast to near the community of Neptune. An approximately 100 yard swath of trees were snapped and uprooted in a small forested area between U.S. 127 and Celina-Mendon Road, north of Myers Road. A garage roof was displaced off the main structure along Celina-Mendon Road, between State Route 197 and Howick Road, causing exterior walls to also collapse. This damage was likely the result of EF2 tornado winds of 115 to 125 mph. ||A garage was destroyed along State Route 197, just northeast of the intersection with Rice Road. A house farther northeast along Riley Road, just south of the intersection with State Route 197, suffered partial roof removal along with the collapse of a few exterior walls. Based on the damage, wind speeds here were estimated to be at the upper-end of the EF1 range, between 100 and 110 mph. A debris path was evident into the field immediately east-northeast, where the tornado appeared to finally lift.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Numerous homes suffered significant roof damage and removal, including exterior wall collapse and complete garage destruction. ||The tornado then carved a path east through Trotwood where damage consistent with EF2 wind speeds was widespread and some homes sustained damage consistent with EF3 wind speeds. Structures here again featured roof removal and exterior wall collapse. This was particularly true on the south side of Westbrook Road. A large number of homes and apartment complexes were impacted further east in Trotwood, with most of this damage consistent with high-end EF2 wind speeds.||The highest winds were estimated to have occurred in a corridor from eastern Trotwood (between Shiloh Springs Road and Westbrook Road), then southeast between Shiloh Springs Road and Turner Road, into areas along the Stillwater River/Riverside Drive area. Embedded within this zone was higher-end EF3 damage. Areas near Riverside Drive and the Stillwater River exhibited damage consistent with wind speeds of 170 mph, or lower-end EF4 damage. This damage included well-built apartment buildings that sustained complete roof and exterior wall removal. In addition, significant tree devastation was found along the Stillwater River, east of Riverside Drive, that included numerous trees that were debarked and nubbed down to the trunk.||The tornado continued southeast through Dayton and Northridge, and crossed I-75 into the Old North Dayton Area, where heavy damage continued to homes and businesses. As the tornado entered Riverside, damage began to lessen in intensity, but plenty of damage consistent with EF1 wind speeds was noted. The tornado continued further to the southeast, causing damage in a subdivision north of Burkhardt Road. The roof of an apartment building on Dodge Court was removed. This is the final known damage caused by this tornado.||An 86 year old woman died (indirect) on September 1st, 2019, in part due to injuries suffered when she was trapped in her home during the tornado.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Many of the thunderstorms produced tornadoes, including a few strong to violent tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado initially touched down just west of Brookville and areas on the south side of Brookville sustained heavy damage, consistent with high-end EF2 wind speeds. Numerous homes suffered significant roof damage and removal, including exterior wall collapse and complete garage destruction. ||The tornado then carved a path east through Trotwood where damage consistent with EF2 wind speeds was widespread and some homes sustained damage consistent with EF3 wind speeds. Structures here again featured roof removal and exterior wall collapse. This was particularly true on the south side of Westbrook Road. A large number of homes and apartment complexes were impacted further east in Trotwood, with most of this damage consistent with high-end EF2 wind speeds.||The highest winds were estimated to have occurred in a corridor from eastern Trotwood (between Shiloh Springs Road and Westbrook Road), then southeast between Shiloh Springs Road and Turner Road, into areas along the Stillwater River/Riverside Drive area. Embedded within this zone was higher-end EF3 damage. Areas near Riverside Drive and the Stillwater River exhibited damage consistent with wind speeds of 170 mph, or lower-end EF4 damage. This damage included well-built apartment buildings that sustained complete roof and exterior wall removal. In addition, significant tree devastation was found along the Stillwater River, east of Riverside Drive, that included numerous trees that were debarked and nubbed down to the trunk.||The tornado continued southeast through Dayton and Northridge, and crossed I-75 into the Old North Dayton Area, where heavy damage continued to homes and businesses. As the tornado entered Riverside, damage began to lessen in intensity, but plenty of damage consistent with EF1 wind speeds was noted. The tornado continued further to the southeast, causing damage in a subdivision north of Burkhardt Road. The roof of an apartment building on Dodge Court was removed. This is the final known damage caused by this tornado.||An 86 year old woman died (indirect) on September 1st, 2019, in part due to injuries suffered when she was trapped in her home during the tornado.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It moved east and entered Miami County at 2128EST along Hall Road, about a half mile northwest of Potsdam. ||As the tornado entered Miami County, significant tree damage occurred on State Route 721 south of Laura. Structural damage began to occur near the intersection of Wright Road and Markley Road, with partial roof loss to an outbuilding. On Ditmer Road and South Shiloh Road, nearly every property sustained tree damage, some of which was significant.||As the tornado neared State Route 571, structural damage became much more severe. Several homes on State Route 571 between South Shiloh Road and South Range Line Road were rendered uninhabitable. Many homes had at least partial roof removal and some sustained complete roof removal. A few homes suffered the collapse of some exterior walls and while this was more common with garage walls, it also occurred on a few well-built walls away from garages. At one home, a lawn tractor was thrown out into the adjacent field to the northeast.||Damage was very similar across the field on South Range Line Road. Two homes experienced complete roof removal, with one also having walls collapse on multiple sides of the second story of the home. Mud splatter on all sides of structures was significant, and one vehicle interior was largely covered in mud after the failure of the rear window. Another home lost a significant portion of the roof, as well as losing quite a bit of material from an interior wall after the winds had entered the structure.  The rotating winds of the tornado were very obvious on this north-to-south oriented road. Along the northern portion of the tornado track, one home lost its entire roof and had it deposited hundreds of feet into the field to the west, opposite the direction of motion of the tornado. Along the southern portion of the tornado track, debris accumulated across the field, along a tree line over a quarter mile away to the east.||The width of this tornado was most evident as it passed east across Elleman Road. Damage was observed as far south as the intersection with State Route 571 and as far north as several spots along State Route 55. While the damage on State Route 55 was primarily to roofing material and trees, more significant structural damage continued to be observed a little farther south on Elleman Road.||The tornado maintained its intensity as it crossed State Route 48 about a mile and a half north of downtown West Milton. Tree damage was severe along this road, with canopy loss even to trees that remained standing. Many structures were heavily damaged or destroyed. The only known injury from this tornado occurred when a trailer home was flipped over. A well-built brick home suffered the collapse of large portions of the west-facing and south-facing walls, with near-complete roof removal. A garage adjacent to this property was flattened. A trailer home just to the south was completely destroyed, with the failure of nearly all exterior walls and even some interior walls. Debris from these homes and structures was carried about a half mile across the field, stopped only by the tree line from traveling farther.||Widespread tree damage and moderate structural damage continued to be observed as the tornado moved east across Calumet Road, Kessler-Frederick Road, and Kessler Road. One home on Kessler Road lost its entire roof and a full-size camper was thrown and wedged against the garage.||Less significant damage was observed after passing Kessler Road, where the tornado turned from the east to the southeast. Damage observed on Nashville Road south of West Kessler Cowlesville Road was limited to trees, and it is believed that the tornado dissipated somewhere in this vicinity.||This tornado was responsible for a lengthy swath of EF2 level damage, generally 120 to 130 mph, extending from State Route 571 to Kessler Road. However, damage to a few homes on State Route 571, South Range Line Road, and State Route 48, was notably more significant, with a combined degree of roof loss and exterior wall collapse that warranted an estimate of 140 mph winds, within the EF3 category.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The start of the school year was delayed by two weeks due to extent of the damage. Two people were (directly) injured by debris when a garage collapsed on them while moving vehicles to safety. Numerous power transmission poles and lines were removed by the tornado.  Around 2 miles south southeast of Burke, the tornado struck a residence causing severe damage to the roof.  Shortly thereafter, the tornado lifted before reaching the intersection of 295th Street and 345th Avenue after traveling a bit less than 4 miles.  The path width reached a maximum of 75 yards within the city of Burke. Up to 3000 trees were damaged by the tornado in and near Burke. Property damage costs are rough estimates.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It continued to trek northeast across Big Creek Road where multiple hardwood trees were uprooted and several large limbs were snapped. A one-story residence lost the majority of its shingles on the backside of the residence, whilst it also snapped two wooden power poles. It continued to uproot and snap hardwood trees on JL Taylor Road in addition to peeling off some of metal roof from a metal outdoor shed.  The tornado gained strength as it pushed northeast across Ballard Road, pushing a mobile home off of its cinder blocks and moving the Union Chapel Church four-feet from its original position, all the while snapping and uprooting multiple hardwood trees. The worst destruction along the aforementioned road occurred with a larger mobile home where it rolled several feet and was completely demolished.  It crossed US Highway 425 uprooting trees and when it moved northeast of US Highway 425 across Hemphill Road, it rolled and destroyed a small mobile home where one injury and one fatality were reported. The fatality occurred several weeks after this tornadic event due to sustained injuries.  It lifted along LA Highway 825 just south of LA Highway 132/Bienville Trace Scenic Byway, but not before uprooting and snapping multiple hardwood trees along LA Highway 825.

As a strong cold front neared the region, supercell thunderstorms developed ahead of the front. These storms tapped into plenty of wind shear in place across the region and this resulted in a few tornadoes occurring across the region.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado began on Roger Miller Road as it snapped the tops of several hardwood trees.  It continued to trek northeast across Big Creek Road where multiple hardwood trees were uprooted and several large limbs were snapped. A one-story residence lost the majority of its shingles on the backside of the residence, whilst it also snapped two wooden power poles. It continued to uproot and snap hardwood trees on JL Taylor Road in addition to peeling off some of metal roof from a metal outdoor shed.  The tornado gained strength as it pushed northeast across Ballard Road, pushing a mobile home off of its cinder blocks and moving the Union Chapel Church four-feet from its original position, all the while snapping and uprooting multiple hardwood trees. The worst destruction along the aforementioned road occurred with a larger mobile home where it rolled several feet and was completely demolished.  It crossed US Highway 425 uprooting trees and when it moved northeast of US Highway 425 across Hemphill Road, it rolled and destroyed a small mobile home where one injury and one fatality were reported. The fatality occurred several weeks after this tornadic event due to sustained injuries.  It lifted along LA Highway 825 just south of LA Highway 132/Bienville Trace Scenic Byway, but not before uprooting and snapping multiple hardwood trees along LA Highway 825. Maximum winds were 120 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 120.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Tree damage in this area was extensive with large old growth hardwoods snapped. The combination of the damage to the conventional brick home, along with the tree damage and manufactured home destruction, prompted the maximum wind rating of 120 mph.

As it crossed Spring Hill Church Road, trees and power lines were down. One home on blocks was destroyed. An area of woods adjacent to the home sustained significant tree damage where all the trees were snapped in a focused corridor from what appears to be an intense vortex. An EF2 rating was given here. The tornado then crossed Zion Hill Church Road, although the tornado weakened a bit at this point, it still snapped and uprooted numerous trees. The tornado then moved along Gholar Road. In this location, the tornado transitioned and took a hard right. While doing so, another intense vortex occurred within otherwise standard EF0, EF1 tree damage. The noted vortex destroyed a mobile home and threw a Nissan truck about 30 yds; one injury occurred here as the person was in the mobile home and was thrown out of it. Shortly after the hard right deviation, another intense vortex developed and more extensive tree damage occurred just east of Sophia Sutton Road. As the tornado crossed Highway 42, it reached peak intensity with winds around 130 mph. Here a large cinder block store was demolished and a well built brick home had the roof removed. Multiple power poles were broken along with numerous trees snapped/uprooted. The tornado continued east-northeast generally along portions of Double Ponds Road. Here more trees were snapped and uprooted. The tornado crossed Highway 13 and then dissipated at Sugar Ridge Road but not before snapping a few tree limbs.  Maximum winds were 130 mph.

This event started over eastern Texas and steadily pushed eastward into the evening and overnight. Storms associated with this system started as a few line clusters then evolved into a full blown linear complex. Within this line, smaller bowing segments formed and it was these features that supported the regional outbreak of tornadoes. A total of 20 tornadoes occurred across our forecast area, six of which were rated as strong (EF2). In addition to the tornadoes, several reports of large hail were received along with many instances of wind damage. Heavy rainfall was also impactful and multiple inches of rain quickly fell across some locations and caused flash flooding, some of it extensive.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado touched down at the intersection of Boyd Duckworth and Lilly Valley Church Roads. Some broken limbs and a few downed trees were noted along with skirting blown from a mobile home. Heading northeast, limb damage increased along with a few more trees down. The covering from a porch and the tin roof of a mobile home was taken off. This debris was thrown into another mobile home and caused the door to fly open which then debris caused a minor injury. Other minor tin damage occurred to a few mobile homes here. Tree damage increased as it cross Decar Page Drive. with EF1 type tree damage continuing as it neared Gilmer Road and crossed Gilmer Road. One home had shingle damage and had the base of the roof lifted some. As the tornado crossed into Smith County, it reached peak intensity and numerous trees were snapped and uprooted. At the end of Smith County Road 21 D, heavy tree damage was noted. One home had the car port removed and residents said the house shifted. Some of the tin roof was damaged as well. As the tornado moved along Old Gilmer Road, a large metal shed had the roof removed. The tornado dissipated shortly after along Old Gilmer Road. This tornado continued into Smith County. Maximum estimated winds were 100 mph. Total path length was 4.11 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This event started over eastern Texas and steadily pushed eastward into the evening and overnight. Storms associated with this system started as a few line clusters then evolved into a full blown linear complex. Within this line, smaller bowing segments formed and it was these features that supported the regional outbreak of tornadoes. A total of 20 tornadoes occurred across our forecast area, six of which were rated as strong (EF2). In addition to the tornadoes, several reports of large hail were received along with many instances of wind damage. Heavy rainfall was also impactful and multiple inches of rain quickly fell across some locations and caused flash flooding, some of it extensive.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado touched down at the intersection of Boyd Duckworth and Lilly Valley Church Roads. Some broken limbs and a few downed trees were noted along with skirting blown from a mobile home. Heading northeast, limb damage increased along with a few more trees down. The covering from a porch and the tin roof of a mobile home was taken off. This debris was thrown into another mobile home and caused the door to fly open which then debris caused a minor injury. Other minor tin damage occurred to a few mobile homes here. Tree damage increased as it cross Decar Page Drive. with EF1 type tree damage continuing as it neared Gilmer Road and crossed Gilmer Road. One home had shingle damage and had the base of the roof lifted some. As the tornado crossed into Smith County, it reached peak intensity and numerous trees were snapped and uprooted. At the end of Smith County Road 21 D, heavy tree damage was noted. One home had the car port removed and residents said the house shifted. Some of the tin roof was damaged as well. As the tornado moved along Old Gilmer Road, a large metal shed had the roof removed. The tornado dissipated shortly after along Old Gilmer Road. This tornado continued into Smith County. Maximum estimated winds were 100 mph. Total path length was 4.11 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The greatest flooding occurred along the Niobrara, Keya Paha, Elkhorn and Loup Rivers; Ponca, Long Pine, Victoria and Cedar creeks; and one fatality occurred from the failure of Spencer Dam that is located on the Niobrara River. In addition to the Spencer Dam failure, several privately owned dams failed. The failure of these private dams contributed to additional overland flooding and most likely exacerbated the flooding in localized areas that led to community evacuations. The combination of weather elements on ice in the rivers led to increased runoff and rapid breakup of ice. Large ice chucks on several rivers destroyed or damaged river bridges, to include state, county and private owned bridges in several counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rain on top of frozen ground, rivers and streams led to historical runoff on the Niobrara River downstream of the Norden river crossing.

Showers across the southern Adirondacks and Mohawk Valley became steadier and heavier during the evening ahead of a strong cold front as the low continued to strengthen. Strong winds aloft mixed down to the surface as an intense line of showers developed along the front, resulting in sporadic wind damage and scattered power outages over eastern New York.||A large swath of rainfall totaling 2-5 inches, with isolated areas as high as 7 inches, occurred over the Mohawk Valley and southern Adirondacks, resulting in reports of flash flooding. The runoff caused rapid rises on area creeks and streams, with river gauges reaching record levels along the Mohawk River at Little Falls, the West Canada Creek at Hinckley and Kast Bridge, and the Sacandaga River at Hope.  Moderate flooding also occurred on the Hudson River at Fort Edward, Hadley, and North Creek; the Schroon River at Riverbank; and the Mohawk River at Delta Dam.  Although river rises and some impacts occurred prior to midnight, the crests occurred on 1 November, and impacts persisted into the first week of November in some areas (see also November StormData). The flooding was extensive over portions of the area, damaging and destroying numerous roads and structures and resulting in water rescues. Between 150 and 200 people were evacuated in Herkimer County. The number of dwellings damaged by the flooding was 344, of which 135 sustained major damage, and 18 were destroyed. There was one fatality as a result of the flooding as a man was swept away by flood waters when he exited his vehicle. ||As a result of the flooding, a major disaster for the state of New York was requested by Governor Cuomo and approved by the President. The monetary damages for public infrastructure requested for the Mohawk Valley and southern Adirondacks totaled around $17 million ($1.2 million for Fulton County, $3.0 million for Hamilton County, $8.8 million for Herkimer County, $0.5 million for Montgomery, $1.6 million for Saratoga, and $1.9 million for Warren). Actual damage amounts were estimated to be even higher by county emergency managers. A state of emergency was declared for Dutchess, Herkimer, Hamilton, Saratoga, and Warren Counties, and boil water notices were issued in Herkimer, Hamilton, and Warren Counties due to floodwater inundation of private and public water systems. The American Red Cross opened shelters to house those displaced by flood damage. ||Other impacts from the flooding and high winds included the cancellation of Amtrak service between Syracuse and Albany due to high water encroaching on train tracks, and portions of the Adirondack Park backcountry becoming impassable due to bridge washouts, high water at stream crossings, and downed trees and debris on trails and at trailheads.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The shoulder of Military Road in Norway collapsed due to flood waters.

As the front effectively stalled in a west-to-east line along the Interstate 40 corridor, showers and storms continued to redevelop and move across the same areas. With rainfall rates approaching 1-2 per hour at times, this led to widespread flash flooding across Humphreys, Dickson, Cheatham, Davidson, Wilson, Smith, Jackson, Putnam, and Overton Counties. This flooding resulted in numerous closed roadways, dozens of water rescues, flooded homes and businesses, significant rises on area creeks and rivers, and unfortunately one fatality in Cheatham County. Total rainfall amounts ranged from 3 inches to nearly 7 inches across these counties. In addition to the flooding, thunderstorms produced two EF-0 tornadoes in Rutherford and Wilson Counties.

Widely scattered thunderstorms began forming around 1 PM CST along and west of Highway 183. By 2 PM CST, a persistent line segment of thunderstorms began affecting western Dawson county. Over the following four hours, this southwest-northeast oriented line slowly crept east across Dawson county into western Buffalo county, with its southwest end moving from Gosper county into Phelps county. A downburst occurred in Cozad where winds were measured at 63 mph. Further east, trees were damaged near Elm Creek. This line of storms subsequently weakened as it moved into eastern Buffalo county. However, between 5 and 9 PM CST, numerous small thunderstorms formed over Gosper, Furnas, Phelps, and Harlan counties. Storms kept forming over these counties until a multi-county area of persistent heavy rain enveloped these counties and expanded north to include Dawson and Buffalo counties. By 9 PM CST, the heaviest rain had morphed to the southeast side of a large, expanding rain shield, with a nearly stationary band stretching from southwest to northeast across Furnas, Phelps, and Buffalo counties. After 10 PM CST, a large squall line that had developed far to the west, over the high plains, began moving into south-central Nebraska. It brought a third period of heavy rain to these counties, but its cold pool aided in shoving the training, slow-moving mass of heavy rain eastward. The two areas of rain merged with a progressive squall line subsequently advancing across the rest of the south central Nebraska. The squall line exited into southeast Nebraska by 230 AM CST. Severe downburst winds occurred a few spots with this squall line. A few tree limbs were snapped off in Oxford and Kearney, and 36 power poles were snapped off over a 2-mile stretch southeast of Holdrege. The highest rainfall total reported was 10.65 inches 3 miles southwest of Odessa. The second highest was 8.88 inches in Loomis. 8.33 fell near Hildreth, 7.66 in Riverdale, 7.60 near Lexington, 6.50 near Cozad, 5.90 near Minden, and 5.64 on the southwest side of Kearney.||Late in the afternoon, a few thunderstorms moved north from Kansas ahead of the storms west of Highway 183. These storms produced some spotty tree damage in Webster and Kearney counties, and damage two livestock sheds in the town of Ayr. A brief rope tornado was also reported near Roseland. ||At the surface, a stalled front extended from the Mid-Atlantic states west to the southern Kansas border. Throughout the day, this front gradually lifted north as a warm front. Meanwhile, low pressure over eastern Colorado moved into northwest Kansas, joining the western end of the front. In the upper-levels weak southwest flow was over Nebraska with a longwave trough advancing eastward through the western U.S., and a ridge over the Upper Midwest. An embedded shortwave trough moved out of Colorado and crossed Nebraska, creating a favorable environment for thunderstorms. As the initial thunderstorms developed, the environment was characterized by surface temperatures in the lower to middle 80s, with dewpoints in the lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, but despite that, MLCAPE was 2500-3000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was weak at less than 20 kt. Precipitable water values were around 1.70 inches, which was close to a record. ||The excessive rainfall resulted in flash flooding in parts of Dawson, Gosper, Furnas, Harlan, Phelps, and Buffalo counties, including flooding across parts of U.S. Highways 6, 30, 183, and 283. Numerous gravel county roads were inundated by flood waters and impassible. Many of them were severely damaged. Roads in the city of Kearney were flooded from one curb to the other, and in at least two separate places, water was 3 to 4 ft deep. Almost 40 vehicles were stranded in Kearney streets. Basements were flooded in some homes due to egress windows breaking. The student union was flooded on the University of Nebraska campus in Kearney. Two to three feet of water was reported in the lower level of the food court. In Lexington, cars were stalled in flood waters and 23 people were evacuated from an apartment building due to flooding. The Red Cross opened a shelter to care for those evacuated.||In some areas, the impacts worsened the following day as creeks swelled out of their banks. Gibbon, Kearney, Odessa, Elm Creek, and Lexington were all severely impacted. U.S. highway 30 was closed due to floodwater from Shelton to Kearney to Elm Creek, as well as near Lexington. Turkey Creek drains into the North Channel of the Platte River, which runs through the south side of Kearney. Water rapidly rose on the south side of the city Tuesday morning, inundating numerous hotels, restaurants, businesses, and basements. At least 200 people had to be evacuated from hotels using construction grade front-end loaders. Approximately 100 other nearby residents needed to be evacuated as well. At its peak, water was 2 to 4 feet high inside the hotels, and 4 to 5 feet high in the parking lots. The water rose so quickly that many people staying at the hotels did not have time to move their vehicles. Most vehicles at the hotels were a total loss. Hundreds of vehicles in the city had to be towed. Some businesses were closed for weeks, others for months, as repairs and remodeling were completed. Kitchen equipment was ruined at some restaurants. Of the 1800 hotels rooms in Kearney, only about 600 were available for use because first floor services, such as check-in desks, laundry facilities, and kitchens were damaged. Stagecoach souvenir shop lost 2,000 pounds of merchandise. Second avenue, which is the main north-south thoroughfare through the city, was closed from Interstate 80 to 11th avenue. The Interstate 80 off ramp was also closed. All traffic to and from the Interstate, from the city, had to use the Kearney East Expressway. Approximately 400 Kearney homes were damaged by the flood, and many more beyond city limits. Just as one example, an egress window gave way in a home on the southeast side of Kearney. Water rushed into the basement, filling it nearly to the ceiling. Extensive flooding resulted in the closure of Yanney Park. A power substation flooded and resulted in power outages to about 450 customers. Flood waters began to subside Wednesday, July 10th, which allowed for one lane of 2nd avenue to be reopened in each direction.||In Odessa, flooding was significant. Water was 4 feet deep on Webb street. A little further south, the Odessa exit from Interstate 80 was closed because of significant flooding. Water was about 3 feet deep at the truck stop adjacent to the Interstate. Semi trucks and cars pulled into the truck stop due to the heavy rain Monday evening, but by 630 AM CST Tuesday, water was up to the top of the wheel wells on several semi's. Flooded vehicles had to be towed. The Platte River, which is very wide and shallow, rose 3 feet in 12 hours from 6 PM CST Monday to 6 AM CST Tuesday, and 4 feet in 24 hours. It is very difficult for the Platte River to flood, but it crested at 8.3 feet at 515 PM CST Tuesday. Flood stage is 7 feet.||In the town of Elm Creek, many roads and basements were flooded. A gauge on Elm Creek indicated that the water level rose 8 feet in 2 hours Monday evening.||The city of Lexington issued a disaster declaration due to the disruption of utility services. Streets and homes were flooded with sewers backing up into homes. ||Flooding was extensive along the Wood River. Moderate flooding occurred at Riverdale with water covering the bridge just north of town. Further to the north, flooding forced the closure of state highway 10 between Pleasanton and Hazard.||In Gibbon, water flooded streets and basements for the second time this year. The northeast side of town was impacted the worst with at least 30 homes and several businesses inundated by floodwater. People had to sandbag their homes and businesses. It is believed that flooding on the Wood River was wider with this event, due to changes in the riverbed from the prior flood in March. Some places that did not flood in that event, flooded this time. Many people commented, I can't believe this has happened twice. Several businesses affected by the March flood still remained closed due to damage.||Amtrak trains that travel between Chicago and Emeryville, CA were halted in Lincoln and McCook due to the flooding. There were probably many more impacts that were not documented here as it is not possible to include everything. Widespread flooding of low-lying areas, creeks, and rivers continued for several days following the excessive rain. Flood waters did not recede in some locations until Monday, July 15th. This devastating flood occurred just four months after a catastrophic flood occurred nearby in mid-to-late March. That flood affected areas primarily along and north of the Platte River.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 46 year old female from Eustis died from injuries sustained in an automobile accident when she encountered flood waters over Highway 21 approximately 4 miles south of Cozad.

A very heavy band of rain dumped over 30 inches of rain in a 12 hour period which created extensive flooding across Jefferson County. The maximum storm total was 44.29 inches near Fannet. The first report of flooding was from the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department with major street flooding in the city of Beaumont and water was entering several homes. Due to the intense rate at which the rain fell flooding depth was worse than Harvey at some locations. Over 5100 homes were flooded. Numerous high water rescues were conducted through out the county. Three people drowned in Jefferson County during the event, 2 men ran off the roadway and into a ditch in different events. Per a family press release, the other man was struck by lightning, but fell in the flood waters and drowned while attempting to save a horse.

Initially, large hail was the main threat, though a couple of tornadoes developed in an area of enhanced low level shear. Later, storms mainly developed along an old outflow boundary and were slow moving. This combined with a moisture rich atmosphere which led to a heavy rain threat, in addition to a hail and strong wind  threat. The heaviest rain fell over Sioux and Emmons counties, where there were multiple reports of over four inches of rain. In Sioux County, on the Standing Rock Nation, flash flooding from the heavy rain resulted in a section of BIA Road 3, locally known as the Kenel Road, being washed out at the crossing with Joe Bush Creek. The culvert washed out and the road collapsed. Four vehicles drove into the washout and resulted in two fatalities and two injuries. The largest hail reported in this episode was golf ball size, and fell in Divide, Morton, and Burleigh counties.

The survivors were the 33-year-old male driver and a 2-year-old boy. Two young boys aged 5 and 8 years old were killed. The location of the flash flood fatalities was in a hilly area, where numerous low water crossings are prone to frequent inundation. A volunteer firefighter familiar with the area estimated the water depth was 3 to 4 feet where the driver of the SUV attempted to cross the creek. The injured victims were airlifted or taken by ambulance to regional hospitals with moderate to serious injuries. The victims were all members of the same family. In the second incident, a truck was swept away at the low water crossing of Upper Whitewater Creek on County Road 234. This location is a couple miles east of Sedgwickville. The 48-year-old male driver from Louisiana was killed. The vehicle was found upside down in the water.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Some of the flash flooding affected the area near the town of Globe, and to the northeast along and to the west of Highway 77. At 1834MST the public reported that water was flowing across Glendale Avenue in Central Heights, about 2 miles east of Claypool. Later that evening at 1950MST, according to the Gila County Sheriff's Office two adults were driving a pickup truck to the north of Globe and were swept away by floodwaters as they tried to cross Irene Gulch. One of the adults was injured but ultimately rescued while the other, a 52 year old woman, perished. They were swept away about 3 miles to the northeast of the town of Claypool. A Flash Flood Warning had been issued for the area well in advance but was either not received or was not heeded.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An upper level disturbance ejecting northeast ahead of the trough across portions of East Texas and North Louisiana during the early morning hours of April 13th carried enough elevated instability, shear, and forcing north of an advancing warm front over Southeast Texas and South Louisiana, such that scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developed, with numerous reports of large hail and occasional damaging winds received. The warm front continued to gradually mix north northwest into East Texas and Northcentral Louisiana by late morning and early afternoon hours, with a very warm, moist, and unstable air mass noted over Deep East Texas and portions of Northcentral Louisiana south of the front. Coupled with even stronger forcing and low level shear ahead of the approaching upper trough, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed near and south of the front from late morning through the afternoon, producing several reports of damaging winds across portions of Northcentral Louisiana. These storms also produced locally heavy rainfall that led to instances of flash flooding, which resulted in two separate fatalities in Ouachita Parish.

Several EF-1 tornadoes were associated with this line, in addition to scattered pockets of wind damage. The storms occurred under a rather strong southwest wind flow ahead of a weak cold front over far western Missouri. A 500 mb shortwave trough over the western high Plains provided some additional support for the storms.

An organized line of severe thunderstorms formed over the central Plains states during the night of the 20th. This bowing line of storms progressed southeast across the St. Louis area during the midday hours, then down across the lower Ohio Valley and southeast Missouri during the afternoon. Widespread wind damage was reported in parts of southern Illinois, especially in far southern areas from the Marion-Carbondale area southward to the Ohio River. Flash flooding was reported in a few locations. The atmosphere ahead of the storms became strongly unstable, with surface-based capes exceeding 4,000. Given the strong buoyancy, wind profiles were sufficiently strong for widespread severe weather. Deep-layer (0-6 km) wind shear values were no higher than about 30 knots, and 0-1 km shear was about 20 knots. Even though the region was under a broad 500 mb ridge, a moderately strong low-level feed of very moist and unstable air fueled the intense storms as they propagated southeastward.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 31-year-old man was struck by lightning while riding a lawn mower.

A fairly large shield of rain, with a few embedded thunderstorms, moved northeast across south central Nebraska from late morning through mid-afternoon. Behind this area of rain, numerous scattered, poorly-organized thunderstorms moved in from Kansas. Between 5 and 7 PM CST, mostly low-end severe hail occurred at various locations from near Alma northeastward to Aurora. The one exception was golf ball size hail that fell a few miles north of Hampton, in Hamilton county.||These storms were elevated as the area was on the cold side of the low pressure system that moved through on the 22nd. By the time these severe thunderstorms occurred, the low was exiting the Great Lakes. The cold front extended southwest, across Kansas, to another low pressure system over Colorado and New Mexico. High pressure was over Nebraska. The flow aloft was highly-amplified with southwest flow over the central Plains a longwave trough and upper low were over the Western U.S., and a ridge was over the East. Surface temperatures and dewpoints were in the 50s. Mid-level lapse rates were 6.5-7.0 C/km, and MUCAPE was between 500 and 1000 J/kg. Effective deep layer shear was 60-70 kt.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Investigators with the Nebraska State Fire Marshal���s Office determined that lightning was the cause of a very large fire that completely destroyed the Cooperative Producers Inc. Dry Fertilizer Facility. This facility opened in July 2018, and was located just east of the intersection of Highway 6 and Showboat Road. Hastings Rural Fire District, along with firefighters from 4 other fire districts, helped contain the fire. The fire was contained by 3 AM CDT, but firefighters were on scene to address hotspots well into Friday. Two injuries were reported as a result of the fire, both injured parties were treated and released at a local hospital within hours of the fire. The injured parties were semi drivers on site at the time of the fire. Damage is estimated to be at least $5 million worth of product at the plant with a facility cost of $14 million.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 19.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
