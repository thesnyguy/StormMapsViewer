Very strong cyclonically curved winds in the mid-levels of the atmosphere near 115 mph and a rapidly deepening surface low over Louisiana and Mississippi aided in strong low-level wind shear and destabilization for severe thunderstorm development. Early Christmas morning, a large elevated rain and thunderstorm shield overspread the entire ArkLaMiss region. A warm front pushed north through southern Louisiana and Mississippi through late morning and through the afternoon while a quickly advancing cold front and developing squall line were occurring across portions of Texas and Louisiana. A Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) Tornado Watch was issued for all of southern Louisiana and Mississippi late Christmas morning for the expected potency of the rotating thunderstorms. Supercells began to develop ahead of the squall line across southern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama south of the warm front during the afternoon. With such ample wind and speed shear, strong tornadoes developed that afternoon. The most notable tornadoes in NWS Jackson's area were two EF2 tornadoes in Lawrence and southern Forrest counties that destroyed several mobile homes and campers, snapped power poles, and uprooted or snapped hundreds of trees. Luckily, no fatalities occurred in association with the tornadoes. The tornado damage in Forrest County was part of a 61 mile long tornado that began in Pearl River County Mississippi, where EF-3 damage occurred, and ended in western Greene County. Numerous trees were reported down across much of central Mississippi from the advancing squall line and its damaging straight-line winds. Flash flooding also occurred across many areas leading to road closures. The severe weather and cold front finally cleared Mississippi by early Christmas evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A large tree fell on a house in Edwards causing heavy damage.

Hot and humid conditions ahead of the cold front allowed for strong instability, which allowed for vigorous thunderstorm development by the mid-afternoon. A belt of strong winds aloft on the southern edge of a potent mid-upper level trough over the Upper Great Lakes extended from the Ohio Valley into Pennsylvania. These winds helped to organize storms into lines and bowing segments. In addition, a tornado threat existed over northern Pennsylvania in an area of strong low-level shear in the vicinity of a retreating, diffuse warm front.||Widespread damaging winds accompanied an intense line of severe thunderstorms that moved from the northwest mountains into the lower Susquehanna Valley from the mid-afternoon into the late evening hours. An EF0 tornado was confirmed near Coudersport at 1515 EDT. Two areas of concentrated straight-line wind damage were also surveyed in McKean and Potter Counties, with estimated maximum winds between 70 and 90 mph. A 66-year-old woman was killed by a falling tree near Genesee in northern Potter County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An official NWS storm survey found widespread straight-line wind damage near Genesee. The survey team identified two areas of more concentrated wind damage which were classified as embedded microbursts. The overall area of wind damage covered an area approximately 1 mile wide and 3 miles Long from Kinney Road eastward through Hickox to Grover Hollow Road. The first area of concentrated damage, consisting of dozens of downed trees, occurred along Kinney Road about 1 mile east of the intersection with Corcoran road. The second concentrated area of microburst damage occurred along Hickox and Grover Hollow Roads. At this location, seven homes sustained minor structural damage. The maximum estimated wind speeds associated with the microburst damage was 90 mph. ||An 66-year-old Andover, NY, woman was killed while trying to evacuate her family from a campsite located along Wintergreen Road in Hickox. Officials said the woman was fastening her Great Grand-daughter into a safety-seat in her vehicle after receiving a text message alerting her of a tornado warning. The woman and her two Grandchildren, ages 19 and 20, were planning on evacuating the campsite, but she was struck by a falling tree in the process. Authorities said the tree struck the Grandmother in the head, killing her instantly. She was pronounced dead at the scene by Potter County Coroner. Witnesses said the tree was struck by lightning before falling. One of her Grand-daughters was also struck and injured by the falling tree while attempting to help her Grandmother. She survived but suffered injuries to her leg and arm and was transported to the hospital.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These storms moved into the Rio Grande Plains toward noon, then linked up with additional lift from an approaching wind shift line drifting south from the South Texas Plains. Feeding on a very unstable atmosphere  - cold and dry air well above the earth���s surface - initial storms would slam Zapata County during lunchtime with damaging wind, large hail, flooding rain, and frequent lightning. As the afternoon progressed, increasing contrast between cooler air across the South Texas Plains (60s and 70s) with the last of the early May heat in the Rio Grande Valley (90s) set the stage for additional storms with damaging winds and flooding rain in Zapata, and culminated with a monster supercell thunderstorm which cruised from southwest Brooks County through Raymondville before weakening.||This impressive supercell storm dominated the episode, and produced a measured instantaneous wind gust over 100 mph in rural Hidalgo County. Fortunately for the populated middle Valley, where more than 700,000 persons are at risk, this cell slid through northern Hidalgo County north of the SR 186 and U.S. 281 interchange, and accelerated through the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge northeast of Linn and San Manuel before reaching Raymondville (Willacy County). The cell quickly weakened by the end of dinner hour (6 to 7 PM CDT) before reaching the Laguna Madre and Gulf of Mexico.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A semi trailer was blown over on US 281, 6 miles north of TX HWY 186. Driver of semi was injured. Driver stated that he had pulled onto the shoulder due to blinding rain and pelting hail and soon after, the downburst moved the trailer onto the dirt shoulder and then turned over. The trailer was carrying 5 tons of cargo (vacuum cleaners) and at least 200 gallons of diesel, which had to be removed from the scene.||The Precinct Constable, who lives about a mile southwest of the trailer incident, reported numerous asphalt shingles pulled from the northwest facing roof, and one window was blown out. Numerous mesquite trees were snapped or had large healthy limbs broken and healthy ebony and oak trees were also damaged on the ranch. Heavy cable was torn out of a telephone tower (0.2 miles SE of the ranch house) at an estimated height of 200 feet above the ground.||A peak instantaneous wind gust of 102 mph was recorded at a 10 meter temporary wind platform as the microburst surged through.  The same platform recorded 35 minutes of wind gusts to 50 mph or higher; the platform was less than one half mile from the Constable's house.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A weak frontal boundary extended from northern Indiana into western Pennsylvania.  Abundant moisture (1.75-2.00 PWAT), strong instability (SBCAPE 4000-5000 J/kg), moderate shear (40kts 0-6km), and a short wave just south of the boundary provided the ingredients for a long-tracked mesoscale convective system, classified by the Storm Prediction Center as a derecho, to track all the way from northern Indiana across eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania, northern WV, and western Maryland. As the MCS crossed the area, widespread wind damage was reported across areas primarily south and west of Pittsburgh. There were several reports of structural damage and damage led to a fatality when a barn collapsed in Muskingum county. Power outages were widespread with up to 130,000 outages reported immediately after the storms passage, most of which, were in Ohio. Muskingum and Guernsey counties sustained $712,000 and $500,000 in damages respectively. This also became on of the the costliest disasters to hit Ohio, right behind Hurricane Ike in 2008.

The storms produced a swath of wind and hail damage in a narrow corridor just to the east of a Princeton to Evansville line. The storms developed along and ahead of a cold front as it advanced south-southeast through central Illinois and central Indiana during the late afternoon. Temperatures reached the upper 90's to near 100 degrees ahead of the storms, resulting in a rather unstable air mass with mixed-layer capes up to 2500 j/kg. Moderately strong winds aloft supported multicell thunderstorms and an occasional supercell structure. Strong surface heating steepened low-level lapse rates, and low relative humidity near the ground enhanced the threat for strong downbursts.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A very destructive macroburst with winds estimated up to 110 mph snapped or uprooted thousands of trees. Hundreds of structures were damaged. A total of 78 structures received major damage such as loss of roof decking or porches, and 249 sustained minor damage such as loss of shingles or minor siding loss. Dozens of barns and sheds were heavily damaged or destroyed. The macroburst damage was concentrated in Oakland City. The damage area extended south to the Warrick County line. In Oakland City, a tree was down on a trailer with residents still inside. The damage path was 3.5 miles wide and 12 miles long. One person was injured due to wind, and three people were injured by hail. All of the injuries occurred in Oakland City, and all were treated at hospitals. Roads were blocked by debris, including State Route 57. Two miles south of Oakland City, part of a roof was on a roadway.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 6.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In many areas, the hail lasted for at least 30 minutes. Tens of thousands of cars were damaged by the hail, windows were shattered, roofs were damaged, and trees were shredded of their leaves. The Lakewood area of Dallas was one of the hardest hit areas. Part of the Lakewood Theater was damaged, and thousands of divots damaged the golf course at the Lakewood Country Club. Historic homes on Swiss Avenue sustained significant roof damage with roof repairs on a few homes estimated over $100,000. A glass exhibit at the Dallas Arboretum sustained damage that was described as relatively minor. This supercell continued to track into Ellis County producing hail damage down to Midlothian. The second supercell in Dallas County tracked from Irving into Cedar Hill. Another supercell produced an EF-0 tornado, 70-95 mph downburst winds, and softball sized hail in Fannin County. The fourth supercell produced hail up to 3.25 in diameter in Collin County. Damage estimates were estimated as high as $2 billion dollars for this event, but insurance companies anticipated the final damage totals to be around $1.1 billion. One head injury was reported when the hail broke through the sunroof of a car.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Damaging downburst winds between 70 to 95 mph caused damage along a line from approximately 1.5 miles north of Randolph to 2 miles east-southeast of Leonard. Many trees were snapped or uprooted along the path and several barns and outbuildings either lost much of their roofs or were overturned. Four manufactured homes were rolled over along the path of destructive winds, and a few more homes sustained damage to the roofs and/or siding. The homes that rolled over were located near FM 1553 and CR 4709 north of Leonard, near CR 4860 and 4855 east of Leonard, and two homes rolled over on CR 4851 east of Leonard. A total of three people were injured from the rolling homes. In addition, the roofs of several buildings in Randolph were partially torn off.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 600.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This outbreak was very dynamically driven with very minimal instability values. However this lack of instability was overcome by a 150 mph tropical jet streak, a negatively tilted mid-level trough, 45 mph low level jet, and the presence of a surface warm front and cold front. ||Thunderstorm initiated over eastern New Mexico as single cells, but transitioned into a linear structure along the leading edged of a surface cold front as they entered the western Texas Panhandle.  Once transitioned into a linear structure, severe thunderstorm wind gusts became the primary threat. This was reflected in the storm reports as numerous thunderstorm wind gusts and wind damage were received, but only one report of 1 inch hail was received. The first report of damage for the outbreak was south-southwest of the town of Vega (Deaf Smith County) where thunderstorm downdrafts blew over center pivots used for irrigation. Several more reports of thunderstorm winds gusts between 60 and 70 mph were received from Deaf Smith, Randall, Potter, and Oldham Counties as the line of thunderstorms moved across the southern Texas Panhandle. In Oldham County three tractor trailers were overturned on US Highway 385 north of the city of Vega.   ||As the thunderstorms moved across Potter and Randall County thunderstorm wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph were reported all across the counties. Two additional tractor trailers rollover accidents were reported on Interstate 27 between Amarillo (Randall County) and Canyon (Randall County), and at the intersection of McAfee Road and Washington Street on the southeast side of Amarillo (Randall County). The accident at McAfee Road and Washington Street resulted in one fatality. Given the west to east track of the line of thunderstorms, vehicles on north-south running roads faced the most hazardous driving conditions due to cross winds, and as a result all rollovers reported occurred on north-south roads. ||Also the turbulent winds near this line of thunderstorm contributed to an aircraft mishap over Armstrong County. The pilot, a locally known dentist from Colorado Springs, Co, and the passenger, the pilot���s father, were killed when their double prop Beechcraft E-90 airplane had an in-flight break-up according to a preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board. The report went on to state that the turbulent air flows caused the aircraft to experience updrafts and downdrafts that tore the fuselage apart. Wreckage from the aircraft were located near the city of Claude (Armstrong County).||As the line of thunderstorms reached the eastern edge of Potter and Randall County, they reached the intersection of the cold front and warm front. The additional low level shear provided by this intersection allowed for three brief tornadoes to form in southern Carson County and central Donley County. The tornado in Carson County lasted 5 minutes and traveled three miles without causing any damage. However a trained spotter provided photographic evidence of its occurrence. Two tornadoes occurred in Donley County; one near Clarendon and another near Lelia Lake. Both lasted a minute in duration but were able to produce noticeable structural damage. All three tornadoes were classified as EF-0. ||By 6 PM CST, the line of thunderstorms became disorganized as the upper level dynamics moved further to the northeast, and no further reports of damage or severe gusts were received.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 69 mph thunderstorm winds gusts estimated via radar caused a tractor trailer rollover accident at the intersection of McAfee Road and Washington Street in Amarillo (Randall County). The tractor trailer was traveling south along Washington Street as a line of thunderstorms moved from west to east across Amarillo. The line of thunderstorms produced a downdraft which struck the tractor trailer perpendicular to its path of travel causing the driver to lose control of the vehicle. The driver of the semi-tractor trailer died as a result of the rollover.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Very strong cyclonically curved winds in the mid-levels of the atmosphere near 115 mph and a rapidly deepening surface low over Louisiana and Mississippi aided in strong low-level wind shear and destabilization for severe thunderstorm development. Early Christmas morning, a large elevated rain and thunderstorm shield overspread the entire ArkLaMiss region. A warm front pushed north through southern Louisiana and Mississippi through late morning and through the afternoon while a quickly advancing cold front and developing squall line were occurring across portions of Texas and Louisiana. A Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) Tornado Watch was issued for all of southern Louisiana and Mississippi late Christmas morning for the expected potency of the rotating thunderstorms. Supercells began to develop ahead of the squall line across southern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama south of the warm front during the afternoon. With such ample wind and speed shear, strong tornadoes developed that afternoon. The most notable tornadoes in NWS Jackson's area were two EF2 tornadoes in Lawrence and southern Forrest counties that destroyed several mobile homes and campers, snapped power poles, and uprooted or snapped hundreds of trees. Luckily, no fatalities occurred in association with the tornadoes. The tornado damage in Forrest County was part of a 61 mile long tornado that began in Pearl River County Mississippi, where EF-3 damage occurred, and ended in western Greene County. Numerous trees were reported down across much of central Mississippi from the advancing squall line and its damaging straight-line winds. Flash flooding also occurred across many areas leading to road closures. The severe weather and cold front finally cleared Mississippi by early Christmas evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tree fell on a mobile home west of Epps along LA Highway 134, fatally injuring one man inside. Additional trees were also blown down in the area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The associated surface low tracked northeast from Kansas across northern Missouri to southern Wisconsin. Ahead of the low and trough, a south-southwesterly low-level jet in excess of 50 knots expanded east across the Mid-Mississippi Valley. An expansive quasi-linear convective system formed along the lead cold front trailing southward from the surface low. Despite rather meager instability, very strong low and mid-level wind fields resulted in organized storm structures with pockets of damaging wind, isolated large hail, and a couple of tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A large section of roof was blown off a house. The roof was a flat roof with no anchors and a rather large overhang. Debris fell on one occupant of the house, who was treated at a local hospital for minor injuries such as scrapes and bruises. The house was damaged extensively. Nearby, three barns and a large tool shed were damaged or destroyed. Two of the barns were old wooden barns that were pushed and leaning over, but still on their foundations. The third barn was an old wooden barn that was destroyed. The tool shed was a steel-frame structure that was heavily damaged on one end. Beams were bent, and siding was torn off. Several small trees were uprooted along Highway 81, and one tree was snapped. Emergency responders could not reach the damaged house and injured person until debris was cleared from the road. All debris was blown toward the east-northeast.

South winds that had developed over the southern plains tried to bring moisture northward, but quality moisture was lacking, which kept the severe thunderstorm potential more of a marginal threat. A pacific cold front began advancing east through Oklahoma during the late morning hours, with thunderstorms developing over parts of west-central Oklahoma by early afternoon. The thunderstorms were quick moving, and had moved near the I-35 corridor by 3 to 4 pm. Sporadic marginally severe hail was reported, although most locations received much small hail. The main concern with the thunderstorms was the wind. Winds ahead of the front were already gusting over 30 mph. Just off the surface, much higher wind speeds were present. At times, some of the stronger winds would come down to the surface. Strong winds caused isolated areas of damage, with one area near Edmond, Oklahoma, and the other east of Ada, Oklahoma. The non-tornadic winds east of Ada approached 100 mph, causing substantial damage to a double-wide trailer. The damage was local however, with very little damage in the surrounding areas. The storms moved into eastern Oklahoma by the early evening hours.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Information provided by a NWS Storm Survey team and local radar confirmed that a strong microburst occurred near the Happyland community.

A Winter Storm Watch was issued for the Southern Sierra Nevada, and Tioga Pass was closed on the 17th; this was the latest date on record that the Pass had been open until.||A weak upper-level trough moved through the central California interior during the night of January 19th-20th. While the trough brought less rain than the computer models had indicated, it did knock down the ridge that had been in place over the state.|The second trough arrived during the evening of the 20th. From midnight to 4 AM on the 21st, 0.63 inch of rain fell on Fresno, a record-setting end to a 60-day stretch without measurable rain. The total rainfall for Fresno on the 21st was 0.79 inch; the old record rainfall had been 0.52 inch, set in 2010.||Lines of showers with a few embedded thunderstorms moved through the central California interior during the early morning hours of January 21st. These lines of convective activity brought locally heavy rain, gusty winds and a few lightning strikes. Scattered thunderstorms continued through the day, producing pea-size hail and a funnel cloud. Tree limbs were blown down by the winds, with downed limbs reported near Lake Isabella and in Yosemite National Park. One large tree limb in the Park fell on a tent cabin, resulting in the death of the occupant.||The third, and final, trough reached central California on the 23rd. This system also brought thunderstorms with small hail. A funnel cloud also was observed. In the Southern Sierra Nevada, snowfall totals from the three storms reached 1�� feet in the high country.||An upper-level ridge built into California behind the departing storm. With abundant ground moisture, the stable airmass allowed the lower layers of the atmosphere to cool to saturation. Consequently, areas of dense fog developed the central and southern San Joaquin Valley. The next few nights saw less fog, mainly confined to west of Highway 99. Clouds over the region during the night of January 26th-27th kept the San Joaquin Valley mostly fog free. However, an upper-level short-wave passing through California did produce areas of drizzle on the Valley floor. The clouds also kept low temperatures in the central and southern San Joaquin Valley unseasonably warm. Both Bakersfield and Fresno bottomed out in the lower 50s and tied their record high minimum temperatures for the 27th (51 and 52 degrees, respectively).||Low clouds persisted over the San Joaquin Valley through much of the day on the 27th, and redeveloped over much of the Valley overnight. Areas of dense fog formed around sunrise, mainly in Kern and Merced Counties, and persisted through late morning. Dense fog redeveloped over San Joaquin Valley again during the early morning of January 29th, and persisted through late morning; a few fog patches lingered into the early afternoon hours.||Mid and high clouds moved into California on the 29th ahead of an upper-level trough that weakened the persistent ridge. Due to the clouds, fog development during the morning of January 30th was patchy, with some areas not seeing fog until around sunrise.||An upper-level disturbance approached the central California coast on January 30th, and moved inland during the afternoon. The disturbance had enough dynamics to trigger isolated light rain showers over the central California interior. The showers brought measurable rain to a few locations, including Fresno and NAS Lemoore, and lingered past midnight into the early morning hours of January 31st.||Bakersfield tied for its 10th warmest January on record, and Fresno had its 16th warmest January on record. For the rain season to date, the central and southern San Joaquin Valley had only received between a third and a half of normal.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A thunderstorm with heavy rain and lightning moved across Yosemite Valley on the morning of the 21st during a strong winter storm.

Most of the branches fell to the south and southwest showing a divergent wind damage pattern.  More tree and large limb damage occurred just northeast of the intersection of School Avenue and Forest Street near the grounds of Holy Cross Catholic Church.  Another microburst occurred at the intersection of West Washington and North Smith Street.  A grocery store lost much of its roof and was displaced into the parking lot south of the store.  A fatality occurred in the parking lot where debris from the roof shattered the front window of a car killing the 28 year old woman who was in the vehicle at the time.  A person in a nearby car sustained minor injuries from the flying debris as well.  Additional minor roof damage occurred at the Cuba post office where some of the roofing material was peeled off.  The length of the microburst damage path was approximately three quarters of a mile and about a third of a mile wide.  Based on the tree and structural damage, winds associated with the microbursts were estimated between 65 and 75 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The storms were triggered by the remains of a mesoscale convective system (MCS) that dropped southeast across the southern Appalachians in the morning hours while strong surface heating created a very unstable air mass as the day progressed. Strong wind shear, steep lapse rates and instability that was approaching 3000 J/kg by mid-morning contributed to the intensity of the storms. The Mountain Empire, New River Valley and Southside Virginia saw most of the activity which featured mainly severe, damaging high winds but also some hail.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A cluster of severe thunderstorms over western Wythe County produced numerous pockets of wind damage. Several homes sustained shingle damage and one had a roof blown off along Old Stage Road. In addition, two persons were injured by falling tree branches near Rural Retreat Lake. Several trees were blown down at the lake and a roof blown off a concession stand.  Additional damage was reported in Rural Retreat and Speedwell. In the northwest part of the county, areas around the country club and Stony Fork were damaged. In eastern Wythe County, Ivanhoe sustained damage.|The area around the Wytheville Golf and Country Club on Highway 11 was also  hit hard with fallen trees and power lines along the road near the West End Cemetery.|Mountain Empire Airport (KMKJ) had 68 mph wind gust at 11:14 AM from this storm.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A surface trough along the Texas-New Mexico border and a jet streak aloft provided the lift necessary for scattered thunderstorm development by 1400 CST. As these storms moved east across the South Plains through the late afternoon and evening, they coalesced into a squall line that developed occasional bowing structures. One of these bows struck western and northern portions of the city of Lubbock toppling a brick wall at the Lubbock Christian University's baseball field. These winds also lofted small gravel and stones that shattered the windows of approximately 20 cars at Texas Tech University and also broke the windows of a nearby bus stop booth. As these storms swept off the Caprock, their overall intensity diminished. An exception to this occurred in southwest Cottle County where a narrow corridor of fierce winds developed just south of a decaying mesoscale convective vortex. Winds at a Texas Tech University West Texas mesonet station located ten miles west-southwest of Paducah were clocked as high as 96 mph within this downburst. Farther north, a slow-moving supercell developed in western Briscoe County and drifted southeast directly over Caprock Canyons State Park accompanied by torrential rain rates of three inches per hour. These rains deluged the park and produced flash flooding along a normally dry creek that drains into Lake Theo. The creek became swollen with several feet of water and proceeded to inundate a bridge causing damage to the asphalt road. Frequent lightning from this day's storms also caused several small grassfires throughout the region, but none of these resulted in any known damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Downburst winds estimated around 70 mph overturned a tractor trailer and injured its driver while traveling southeast on U.S. Highway 84.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The counties were battered by the derecho which downed trees, power lines and poles, sparked fires and destroyed some homes.||There were three storm related deaths, two boys camping in Salem County and a man whose boat capsized in Absecon Bay in Atlantic County. A preliminary damage assessment put the cost at around $20 million for the three counties.  In all sixteen homes were destroyed, ninety-two suffered major damage, one hundred eighty-seven suffered minor damage and another one hundred and twelve were affected by the derecho. In addition, forty-one businesses suffered major damage and three hundred twenty-nine suffered minor damage. A state of emergency was declared in Atlantic County. Governor Chris Christie mobilized the National Guard to help provide fuel and water. President Barack Obama has issued a disaster declaration for parts of South Jersey in the wake of the derecho.

Severe thunderstorms exited eastern Salem County, including the town of Elmer, at approximately 1:06 am EDT on the 30th. ||Widespread damage occurred across Salem County as a result of the strong wind gusts associated with the gust front and cluster of severe thunderstorms. One home was destroyed, another suffered major damage. Three other homes suffered minor damage and one other was also affected. Numerous large tree limbs blew down in the town of Elmer. The Little Acres Farm in Pittsgrove Township had about four dozen 80-foot trees completely uprooted. Approximately 70 trees were knocked down onto roadways across the county, resulting in numerous road closures. Several hundred large trees were knocked down or damaged in Parvin State Park (Pittsgrove Township) in eastern Salem County, and two fatalities resulted. Two young boys, ages 2 and 7, were killed when the top half of a 40 to 50 foot pine tree snapped off due to high wind gusts and landed on the camping tent where they and other family members were taking shelter. The two boys were cousins, one from nearby Franklin Township (Gloucester County) and the other from Millville (Cumberland County). An intense cluster of thunderstorms tracked over eastern Salem County at 12:50 am EDT on the 30th, producing wind gusts estimated between 70 to 75 mph.  ||Thousands of customers lost power across the county as a result of extensive tree and wire damage, with many areas experiencing power outages for up to one week. Some customers did not have their power restored until after the 4th of July. As a result, Salem County Emergency Services and the American Red Cross established air-conditioned cooling centers in Woodstown and at the Pittsgrove Township Municipal Building as temperatures soared into the 90s during the week following the derecho.||Damage estimates for Parvin State Park alone are approximately $500,000 as several buildings were damaged and hundreds of trees were either knocked down or damaged. More than a month following the derecho, the majority of the park remained closed to the public as clean-up efforts continued. The swimming beach and concession stand at the park did not reopen until the weekend of July 21st - 22nd. Through early August 2012, some 938 trees have been removed from the park, and damaged large limbs from another 989 trees have been hauled away.

Each storm followed nearly the same track along the Alaska Peninsula then along the Bering Sea coast, setting up a strong moist fetch into the Southcentral Alaska.  This resulted in widespread flood damage over a large area.  Storm total precipitation ranged from 21 to 27 inches along the eastern Kenai Peninsula, while further inland between 6-12 inches of rain fell along the Talkeetna Mountains north to the headwaters of the Nenana River.  A large number of roads and bridges were affected; damage to the Alaska Railroad was severe enough to shut down the rail service for several days.  Almost 60 homes were either severely damaged or destroyed and over 700 other homes were either affected or sustained minor damage; most of the damage occurred along the Little Susitna River and Willow Creek.  State estimates of damage to individual property approached $3.5 million, public infrastructure exceeded $19 million statewide, and the military base in Anchorage sustained an addition $3.5 million in flood damages.  There was one fatality associated with the flooding.  On September 24, a 51 year old man died while attempting to cross a swollen creek on his ATV.||In addition to flooding, the storms brought strong east and southeast wind to an area from southeast Prince William Sound, to Cordova, through Portage Pass, along Turnagain Arm and along the Anchorage.  The first strong storm resulted in wind through the Chugach Mountains with an unofficial peak wind of 120 mph measured by a spotters home weather system in Bear Valley.  In the other wind-prone locations, peak wind was generally around 70 to 75 mph, with 90 mph in reported in Portage Valley.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Susitna River at Sunshine crested at 27.66ft on 9/21/12 at 23:00 AKDT.  Damages in the Susitna Valley were extensive, with several railroad bridges and smaller roads flooded and washed out.  Most of the homes destroyed and damaged were in the Susitna Valley.  on 9/24/12 a 51 year old man died while attempting to cross a swollen creek in a remote hunting area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.37M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Due to the very humid and unstable nature of the atmosphere, the storms produced locally heavy rainfall with rain rates well in excess of one inch per hour. A Flash Flood Warning was issued at about 430 pm, which led to road closures west of El Centro, in the area near Seeley and Dixieland. Thunderstorms persisted into the evening, and additional rainfall led to areas of flooding along Interstate 8, Evan Hewes Highway and Highway 98. According to the California Highway Patrol, at approximately 9 pm flooding caused the closure of Interstate 8 in both directions between Drew Road and Dunaway Road. At 830 pm, local law enforcement reported the evacuation of 5 homes on Evan Hewes Highway due to a bank collapse along the Westside main canal. Heavy rain from earlier storms led to the collapse of the canal bank, and canal water then spread into the homes just west of Seeley. Overflow from the Westside canal eroded Evan Hewes Highway west of Westside road, and 100 feet of the highway were washed away. As a result, Evan Hewes Highway was closed from Dunaway to Westside road. In addition, Dunaway road was damaged beyond repair due to the flooding. Several minor injury traffic accidents were reported during the heavy rain and flooding, as rains limited visibility and made roads very slick. Finally, the breach of the canal resulted in no access to the Centinela State Prison. At 730 pm the Flash Flood Warning was replaced by an areal Flood Warning which continued through 430 am on July 31st.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 400.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Very strong cyclonically curved winds in the mid-levels of the atmosphere near 115 mph and a rapidly deepening surface low over Louisiana and Mississippi aided in strong low-level wind shear and destabilization for severe thunderstorm development. Early Christmas morning, a large elevated rain and thunderstorm shield overspread the entire ArkLaMiss region. A warm front pushed north through southern Louisiana and Mississippi through late morning and through the afternoon while a quickly advancing cold front and developing squall line were occurring across portions of Texas and Louisiana. A Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) Tornado Watch was issued for all of southern Louisiana and Mississippi late Christmas morning for the expected potency of the rotating thunderstorms. Supercells began to develop ahead of the squall line across southern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama south of the warm front during the afternoon. With such ample wind and speed shear, strong tornadoes developed that afternoon. The most notable tornadoes in NWS Jackson's area were two EF2 tornadoes in Lawrence and southern Forrest counties that destroyed several mobile homes and campers, snapped power poles, and uprooted or snapped hundreds of trees. Luckily, no fatalities occurred in association with the tornadoes. The tornado damage in Forrest County was part of a 61 mile long tornado that began in Pearl River County Mississippi, where EF-3 damage occurred, and ended in western Greene County. Numerous trees were reported down across much of central Mississippi from the advancing squall line and its damaging straight-line winds. Flash flooding also occurred across many areas leading to road closures. The severe weather and cold front finally cleared Mississippi by early Christmas evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down in a wooded area near Trace Road producing mostly tree and minor roof damage to the homes in the area. As it moved to the northeast, the width increased to near 0.25 miles near Ford-Calcote and James Fox Roads producing significant tree damage. As it continued northeast crossing Conley Peavey Road, a carport awning was removed and part of a barn was destroyed, along with more heavy tree damage. As it approached Highway 84, the width decreased to around 1/10 if a mile and the tornado increased in intensity. It was at this time that the tornado was most intense (EF-2) resulting in several mobile homes and travel trailers being lofted and ultimately destroyed. A small business had substantial roof damage with two walls being blown out. An abandoned brick gas station had its roof removed and windows blown out, with the awning support poles bent and awning roof blown away. As the tornado approached Highway 27 northwest of Monticello, more tree damage was noted while it collapsed a patio roof on a house on Friendship Lane just north of Monticello. Minor tree damage occurred along the remainder of the track. Maximum winds were estimated at 120 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Very strong cyclonically curved winds in the mid-levels of the atmosphere near 115 mph and a rapidly deepening surface low over Louisiana and Mississippi aided in strong low-level wind shear and destabilization for severe thunderstorm development. Early Christmas morning, a large elevated rain and thunderstorm shield overspread the entire ArkLaMiss region. A warm front pushed north through southern Louisiana and Mississippi through late morning and through the afternoon while a quickly advancing cold front and developing squall line were occurring across portions of Texas and Louisiana. A Particularly Dangerous Situation (PDS) Tornado Watch was issued for all of southern Louisiana and Mississippi late Christmas morning for the expected potency of the rotating thunderstorms. Supercells began to develop ahead of the squall line across southern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama south of the warm front during the afternoon. With such ample wind and speed shear, strong tornadoes developed that afternoon. The most notable tornadoes in NWS Jackson's area were two EF2 tornadoes in Lawrence and southern Forrest counties that destroyed several mobile homes and campers, snapped power poles, and uprooted or snapped hundreds of trees. Luckily, no fatalities occurred in association with the tornadoes. The tornado damage in Forrest County was part of a 61 mile long tornado that began in Pearl River County Mississippi, where EF-3 damage occurred, and ended in western Greene County. Numerous trees were reported down across much of central Mississippi from the advancing squall line and its damaging straight-line winds. Flash flooding also occurred across many areas leading to road closures. The severe weather and cold front finally cleared Mississippi by early Christmas evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down in a wooded area near Trace Road producing mostly tree and minor roof damage to the homes in the area. As it moved to the northeast, the width increased to near 0.25 miles near Ford-Calcote and James Fox Roads producing significant tree damage. As it continued northeast crossing Conley Peavey Road, a carport awning was removed and part of a barn was destroyed, along with more heavy tree damage. As it approached Highway 84, the width decreased to around 1/10 if a mile and the tornado increased in intensity. It was at this time that the tornado was most intense (EF-2) resulting in several mobile homes and travel trailers being lofted and ultimately destroyed. A small business had substantial roof damage with two walls being blown out. An abandoned brick gas station had its roof removed and windows blown out, with the awning support poles bent and awning roof blown away. As the tornado approached Highway 27 northwest of Monticello, more tree damage was noted while it collapsed a patio roof on a house on Friendship Lane just north of Monticello. Minor tree damage occurred along the remainder of the track. Maximum winds were estimated at 120 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Over a dozen tornadoes occurred in northwest Oklahoma in addition to the numerous tornadoes in Kansas.||Much of Oklahoma remained under clear skies for the afternoon, which coupled with plentiful moisture allowed very strong instability to develop. A dryline stretched from western Kansas into northwest and western Oklahoma through the afternoon hours.

The first tornado was not reported until nearly 4pm as low level wind shear increased gradually. The tornado reports continued through nearly 1am with the tornado that impacted Woodward, OK the last tornado of the evening.||With the first supercells firing around 2 PM, many dropped large hail, some as large as 3 inches in diameter.

This supercell produced multiple tornadoes near Cherokee and continued moving to the northeast. One tornado with this supercell produced damage to a cemetery west of Byron. Fortunately, many of the tornadoes from this thunderstorm remained over mainly rural areas in Waynoka, Woods and Alfalfa counties.||Another tornadic supercell developed southwest of Woodward before midnight and tracked toward Woodward.

A dry slot associated with the low overspread the region, bringing most of the rain and shower activity to an end during the afternoon hours. However, a small line of thunderstorms developed along the surface cold front over the western Upstate. The southern-most cell in the line began to exhibit mini-supercell characteristics as it moved across the upstate and into the southern foothills of North Carolina. As the storm interacted with the remnants of an old warm frontal boundary, it produced a series of tornadoes over the foothills. To be precise, one mini-supercell thunderstorm produced a tornado in Cleveland County, while a second mini-supercell rapidly strengthened just east of the first storm. This second went on to produce tornadoes in Burke and Caldwell Counties. Effective bulk shear in the region where the tornadoes occurred ranged from 40 to 50 kts with MUCAPE values of around 500 j/kg.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado damage path begin near the Ellenboro community, just northeast of the intersection of Pinehurst Rd and Bridge Rd. The track was relatively weak and intermittent for the first mile or so, as it crossed into a wooded area before emerging on Tiney Rd near the Corinth community. The aluminum siding and some roofing was peeled off a shed at this location. The intermittent path continued to the northeast, before becoming more concentrated in the area near Piney Mountain Rd and Piney Mountain Church Rd. The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved roughly parallel to Piney Mountain Rd, crossing W E Padgett Rd toward Walls Church Rd. Several homes received minor to major damage in this area, while two mobile homes were completely destroyed. Ten people were injured, one seriously. Several outbuildings were also destroyed, while numerous trees and power lines were felled. The tornado began to weaken as it continued northeast, crossing Walls Church Rd and Dycus Rd before lifting just north of Salem Church Rd. The tornado was the first winter tornado in Rutherford County recorded history, and the first significant tornado (F2/EF2 and stronger) to affect the county since 1989.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A dry slot associated with the low overspread the region, bringing most of the rain and shower activity to an end during the afternoon hours. However, a small line of thunderstorms developed along the surface cold front over the western Upstate. The southern-most cell in the line began to exhibit mini-supercell characteristics as it moved across the upstate and into the southern foothills of North Carolina. As the storm interacted with the remnants of an old warm frontal boundary, it produced a series of tornadoes over the foothills. To be precise, one mini-supercell thunderstorm produced a tornado in Cleveland County, while a second mini-supercell rapidly strengthened just east of the first storm. This second went on to produce tornadoes in Burke and Caldwell Counties.

The track was relatively weak and intermittent for the first mile or so, as it crossed into a wooded area before emerging on Tiney Rd near the Corinth community. The aluminum siding and some roofing was peeled off a shed at this location. The intermittent path continued to the northeast, before becoming more concentrated in the area near Piney Mountain Rd and Piney Mountain Church Rd. The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved roughly parallel to Piney Mountain Rd, crossing W E Padgett Rd toward Walls Church Rd. Several homes received minor to major damage in this area, while two mobile homes were completely destroyed. Ten people were injured, one seriously. Several outbuildings were also destroyed, while numerous trees and power lines were felled. The tornado began to weaken as it continued northeast, crossing Walls Church Rd and Dycus Rd before lifting just north of Salem Church Rd. The tornado was the first winter tornado in Rutherford County recorded history, and the first significant tornado (F2/EF2 and stronger) to affect the county since 1989.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A south-southwesterly low level jet from 60 to 70 knots veered to west-southwest around 75 knots at 500 mb. By mid-morning, the solid squall line evolved into a broken line of discrete storms over the Pennyrile region and Kentucky Lake region. While these discrete storms maintained severe levels, their tornado production decreased.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado continued into McCracken County from Ballard County. Six to eight residences were heavily damaged or destroyed. The residences were a mix of mobile homes and houses. The steeple was blown off a church. Numerous barns and sheds were destroyed or damaged, with debris carried several hundred yards and deposited in trees. There were several injuries, including one serious injury. Two semi-trailers were flipped on their side. A few stationary vehicles were moved 50 to 75 yards. The tornado exited the county when it crossed the Ohio River into Massac County, IL.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

There was a surface trough across Southeast New Mexico and far West Texas with a retreating dryline across the Permian Basin and the lower Trans Pecos.  A Pacific front moved through the area after sunset.  The collision of the front with the dryline along with good shear and instability provided a ripe environment for severe thunderstorm development.  A line of convection developed, and the storms went on to produce a tornado near Gardendale, TX and severe hail across the Permian Basin.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A line of severe thunderstorms moved into Ector County around 11:20 PM CDT March 18th and progressed eastward.  At 12:28 AM CDT March 19th, a tornado touched down in the Gardendale community and remained on the ground for two minutes.  This tornado produced damage along County Road 30 (Goldenrod Drive) primarily between Chinaberry Avenue and Alfalfa Avenue.  As the tornado developed, it moved just south of an RV Park located near the intersection of County Road 30 and China Berry Ave.  This resulted in a large camper being toppled by severe northwest winds flowing into the tornado.  One minor injury was noted at this location.  As the tornado intensified and progressed northeastward, strong inflow winds from the south resulted in a cinder block fence being blown over to the north.  Finally, as the tornado crossed County Road 30 (Goldenrod Drive), it reached its peak intensity.  This resulted in significant damage to a residential home, along with a 20' x 30' travel trailer and a barn being destroyed.  Widespread damage was noted in this area, which also served as a collection point for a great amount of debris from other locations upwind back to the southwest.  South of County Road 30, power poles with broken cross members were noted.  This was indicative of EF1 tornado damage.  However, the tornado intensified after crossing to the north side of County Road 30 (Goldenrod Drive).  There was a home that shifted slightly off its foundation.  Also, there was significant loss of roof decking and major shingle loss.  Some small pieces of debris became projectiles, sticking into the walls of the home.  Based on this information, winds for this event were estimated to be 90-110 mph.   The Gardendale tornado at its most intense - north of County Road 30 - was rated as a low end EF-2 tornado.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

There was a surface trough across Southeast New Mexico and far West Texas with a retreating dryline across the Permian Basin and the lower Trans Pecos.  A Pacific front moved through the area after sunset.  The collision of the front with the dryline along with good shear and instability provided a ripe environment for severe thunderstorm development.  A line of convection developed, and the storms went on to produce a tornado near Gardendale, TX and severe hail across the Permian Basin.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A line of severe thunderstorms moved into Ector County around 11:20 PM CDT March 18th and progressed eastward.  At 12:28 AM CDT March 19th, a tornado touched down in the Gardendale community and remained on the ground for two minutes.  This tornado produced damage along County Road 30 (Goldenrod Drive) primarily between Chinaberry Avenue and Alfalfa Avenue.  As the tornado developed, it moved just south of an RV Park located near the intersection of County Road 30 and China Berry Ave.  This resulted in a large camper being toppled by severe northwest winds flowing into the tornado.  One minor injury was noted at this location.  As the tornado intensified and progressed northeastward, strong inflow winds from the south resulted in a cinder block fence being blown over to the north.  Finally, as the tornado crossed County Road 30 (Goldenrod Drive), it reached its peak intensity.  This resulted in significant damage to a residential home, along with a 20' x 30' travel trailer and a barn being destroyed.  Widespread damage was noted in this area, which also served as a collection point for a great amount of debris from other locations upwind back to the southwest.  South of County Road 30, power poles with broken cross members were noted.  This was indicative of EF1 tornado damage.  However, the tornado intensified after crossing to the north side of County Road 30 (Goldenrod Drive).  There was a home that shifted slightly off its foundation.  Also, there was significant loss of roof decking and major shingle loss.  Some small pieces of debris became projectiles, sticking into the walls of the home.  Based on this information, winds for this event were estimated to be 90-110 mph.   The Gardendale tornado at its most intense - north of County Road 30 - was rated as a low end EF-2 tornado.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the cold front progressed eastward, individual supercells developed in advance of the front and moved through Alabama during the early morning hours on January 23rd. Several long track supercells produced strong, long track tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down in central Jefferson county and tracked northeastward for 15.69 miles, before lifting in western St. Clair county. It touched down along Pawnee Village Rd, about 3.25 miles northeast of Tarrant where several businesses sustained roof and wall damage. The tornado then tracked to the northeast, across Pinson Valley Parkway where several additional businesses were heavily damaged or destroyed. In the city of Center Point, the path width increased to 880 yds as the tornado strengthened to 120 mph.  Center Point Elementary School sustained extreme damage, with one building destroyed and extensive damage to several other buildings. The destroyed building was valued at $13 million and the loss of contents inside at $5 million. The tornado continued northeast, crossing Center Point Parkway, causing damage to numerous businesses near 24th St.  Minor roof damage, consistent with winds of 100 MPH, occurred to multiple businesses, gas stations, and a strip mall. The tornado crossed Sweeney Hollow Rd and Tyler Loop Rd, and moved through Paradise Valley subdivision, damaging or destroying approximately 200 homes.  As the tornado crossed Old Springville Rd, it intensified to 150 MPH, causing extensive damage or destroying to two dozen homes in the George Brook subdivision.  Of the homes destroyed, most, if not all, exterior and interior walls were collapsed.  The tornado crossed the southern extent of Steeplechase subdivision, destroying two homes, where one fatality occurred, and causing minor to moderate roof damage to numerous other homes.  Path width was approximately 600 yds wide at this point.  The tornado continued northeast, causing minor to moderate damage to numerous homes in the Pilgrim���s Rest subdivision. The heaviest damage was along Plymouth Rock Dr., where approximately a dozen homes were destroyed.  As the tornado approached the St. Clair county line, it weakened to an EF1 with winds of 105 MPH, and caused significant damage to at least two homes, with minor damage to several others along Skyline Way. In addition, numerous trees were knocked down. The tornado crossed into St. Clair County south of Will Keith Rd, one mile north of Interstate 59, Exit 148. In total, approximately 50 businesses received some degree of damage, 200 homes were heavily damaged or destroyed, and 200 homes received minor to moderate damage.

This tornado was the strongest of the day in the southeastern U.S.--rated a strong EF3 with 165 MPH maximum winds.  The tornado formed on a northward-extending peninsula in Lake Chickamauga, just north of the Booker T. Washington State Park. At this point, the tornado downed a few trees and caused some light structural damage. ||The tornado then moved ENE and crossed Waconga Bay.  On the east side of the bay the tornado smashed a very large marina--Island Cove Marina--causing $6,000,000 in damage.  The tornado was a strong EF1 with about 110 mph winds.  The tornado track so far was about 2 miles long.||The tornado continued to strengthen as it went on land, crossed State Highway 58 and quickly strengthed to EF2.  Over the next two miles the path was a consistent EF2 to EF3 through several neighborhoods.  The worst damage was found along Short Tail Springs Road, Woodland Bay Drive and Davis Mill Circle.  The most intense damage was found near the intersection of Short Tail Springs Road and Woodland Bay Drive where many residences suffered EF3 damage with one residence wiped out.  Across, to the south of Short Tail Springs Road, an entire forest of trees was downed.  ||By the time the tornado left this neighborhood it was mainly EF2, went across another couple of inlets of the lake, and emerged as an EF1 by the time it crossed Ooltewah-Georgetown Rd, (CR 1145).  From here to the Bradley County line, the tornado continued to the ENE through rural areas oscillating between EF1 and low-end EF2 damage.  The tornado continued into and across Bradley, northern Polk County, and into southern McMinn County.  The total pathlength was 41 miles.||In Hamilton County, there were 30 injuries, including 6 serious injuries, but no fatalities. There were 80+ homes destroyed, 85+ homes with major damage with a total of 260+ with damage to about $20 Million.  Damage to public infrastructure totaled $2.1 Million.  Initial overall estimates exceeded $28 Million.||A Presidential Disaster was declared for this area.  EMA officials were amazed there were no deaths after seeing the intensity at some locations.||Note: The tornado had two turns in Hamilton County--a slight left turn at 35.1367/-85.1121 and another slight left turn (even farther left) at 35.1585/-85.0352.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 28.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado formed on a northward-extending peninsula in Lake Chickamauga, just north of the Booker T. Washington State Park. At this point, the tornado downed a few trees and caused some light structural damage. ||The tornado then moved ENE and crossed Waconga Bay.  On the east side of the bay the tornado smashed a very large marina--Island Cove Marina--causing $6,000,000 in damage.  The tornado was a strong EF1 with about 110 mph winds.  The tornado track so far was about 2 miles long.||The tornado continued to strengthen as it went on land, crossed State Highway 58 and quickly strengthed to EF2.  Over the next two miles the path was a consistent EF2 to EF3 through several neighborhoods.  The worst damage was found along Short Tail Springs Road, Woodland Bay Drive and Davis Mill Circle.  The most intense damage was found near the intersection of Short Tail Springs Road and Woodland Bay Drive where many residences suffered EF3 damage with one residence wiped out.  Across, to the south of Short Tail Springs Road, an entire forest of trees was downed.  ||By the time the tornado left this neighborhood it was mainly EF2, went across another couple of inlets of the lake, and emerged as an EF1 by the time it crossed Ooltewah-Georgetown Rd, (CR 1145).  From here to the Bradley County line, the tornado continued to the ENE through rural areas oscillating between EF1 and low-end EF2 damage.  The tornado continued into and across Bradley, northern Polk County, and into southern McMinn County.  The total pathlength was 41 miles.||In Hamilton County, there were 30 injuries, including 6 serious injuries, but no fatalities. There were 80+ homes destroyed, 85+ homes with major damage with a total of 260+ with damage to about $20 Million.  Damage to public infrastructure totaled $2.1 Million.  Initial overall estimates exceeded $28 Million.||A Presidential Disaster was declared for this area.  EMA officials were amazed there were no deaths after seeing the intensity at some locations.||Note: The tornado had two turns in Hamilton County--a slight left turn at 35.1367/-85.1121 and another slight left turn (even farther left) at 35.1585/-85.0352.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 28.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An upper level low pressure lifted northeast out of the southwest U.S.  The upper level center, as well as the surface low, passed northwest of Iowa, across southeast South Dakota into Minnesota.  Severe weather developed north of the warm front as it lifted north into Iowa.  A cluster of severe storms formed over northeast Kansas and southeast Nebraska.  These storms moved east-northeast along the warm front into Iowa, causing a considerable amount of severe weather.  Severe weather parameters were fairly strong, however the dynamics of a 100 kt mid level jet and 60 kt low level jet made up the difference.  Just prior to the storm development, CAPE values were around 4000 J/kg south of the development.  Helicity was high, in the 300 to 500 range.  There was a large amount of effective shear with 50 to 65 kts available.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 layer of the atmosphere was in the 200 to 400 J/kg range, while downdraft CAPE was 600 to 800 J/kg.  Plenty of low level moisture was drawn into the state on the strong low level jet.  Precipitable water vales rose to 1.25 inches quite rapidly.  The LCL level was relatively high, but given the dynmics was relatively easy to overcome.  The LCL was just under 1000 meters at the beginning of the event.  There were three tornadoes reported during the event.  One was northwest of the Creston area in Union County.  The most significant tornado caused high end EF2 damage to the far northwest corner of Creston. This tornado formed southwest of Cromwell at 1752 CST in Adams county and quickly tracked into northwest Creston around 1800 CST. EF2 damage occurred to the Greater Regional Medical Center and the Southwestern Community College campus. The tornado continued tracking to the northeast and damaged several farmsteads northeast of Creston before dissipating about 10 miles northeast of town at approximately 1815 CST.  The wind strength was estimated to be 130 MPH. Significant damage occurred with uninsured damage alone near $2,000,000.  A tornado touched down in Warren County east of New Virginia.  The tornado caused damage to farm buildings and campers with a considerable amount of sheet metal left lying around.  The EF1 tornado produced winds around 100 MPH.  Many of the thunderstorms brought with them high winds and hail.  The final tornado touched down in Mahaska County.  The tornado was an EF1 tornado with a broad and intense rear flank downdraft south of the track.  The AWOS site at the Oskaloosa airport in Mahaska County recorded a 97 MPH wind gust from the rear flank downdraft of the storm. Reports from the Emergency Manager indicated that damage at the airport was limited to two hangar doors and some damage to airport buildings.  There were no planes on the field at the time. Numerous reports of hail larger than quarter size were received.  Some of the larger hail included baseball size hail in Clarke County at Murray and numerous reports of golf ball size hail along the track of the severe cluster from Union County to Mahaska County.  The same cluster of storms also produced very strong winds along its path.  Numerous reports of 60 to 70 MPH winds were received all along the path.  Numerous reports of tree and power line damage were received.  The Des Moines metro area was hard hit with winds of up to 65 MPH causing considerable tree damage.  At one time, 20,000 customers were reported without power.  In Marion County a garage was destroyed and a house significantly damaged by the wind east of Knoxville.   The storms also produced very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches was reported at several locations.  At the Des Moines International Airport, 1.10 inches of rain fell between 1630 and 1637 CST.  This amount of rainfall in that short of period of time was a 100 year event.  Fortunately it had been quite dry across the state, limiting the flash flood potential.  Flash flooding was reported in Polk, Cass, and Madison Counties.  Water was reported flowing one to two feet deep.  Numerous reports were also received of street flooding and significant ponding.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado continued in from Adams county.  NWS storm survey confirmed a strong EF2 tornado.  It entered Union county just southwest of Cromwell and tracked east-northeast through the far northwest portion of Creston.  The Greater Regional Medical Center and Southwest Community College sustained EF2 damage with the worst occurring to the Green Hills Education Center.  The tornado continued tracking northeast and damaged a few farmsteads northeast of Creston.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Around dawn, a warm front moved north of the Ohio River, accompanied by scattered elevated thunderstorms that produced small hail. During the early afternoon, temperatures rose into the lower 70s across southern Indiana. the combination of extreme wind shear and CAPE near 2000 Joules/kg brought several long lived supercells to the state near the Ohio River.

Several trees were snapped off with estimated EF-1 damage along a path of 30 yards wide along the south fork of the Blue Lick River.  After crossing farmland, the tornado widened and intensified quickly, toppling a high tension metal power structure near the intersection of Homers Chapel and Fredricksburg Roads. Damage at that location was consistent with 130 mph winds.  ||High tension wires were downed and trees snapped along West End Road just north of Shanks Hill Road.  The tornado continued to intensify as it crossed State Route 135 at Dutch Creek Road, ripping large chunks of 3 inch thick asphalt from a section of roadway and depositing large pieces up to 30 yards away, with smaller chunks of pavement found a quarter of a mile downstream.  Just east of State Route 135, tremendous tree damage began. At this point, the tornado widened to around 200 yards. As the tornado crossed Trainer Lane and Route 335 towards Robbs Lane, widespread tree and structural damage indicated EF-2 to EF-3 damage. At this point, the damage path began to widen to one third of a mile. ||After crossing Highway 60 just south of New Pekin, tremendous structural damage was surveyed. A large well-constructed factory building was cleared to its foundation slab with numerous anchoring bolts bent and stripped. Debris from this building was observed up to three quarters of a mile downstream. Large power poles were snapped. Another metal out building on the edge of the circulation had sheeting pulled off, apparently from the force of inbound winds towards the circulation. In this area 5 people were killed in a mobile home. Damage suggested an EF-4 tornado with a width of three to four tenths of a mile and estimated winds of 170 mph. ||The tornado then traveled along the border between Washington and Crawford counties where it caused widespread destruction southeast of Hurst and along East Daisy Hill Road in the county.  Here, a well constructed one story brick home at the top of a ridge was completely destroyed with no wall left standing. Witnesses described the funnel as a black wall. A heavy semi trailer cab was blown from this house and landed near another destroyed brick home. Damage to these homes suggested EF-4 winds of 170 mph.

Road 424) at 255 am.  At this location part of the roof of an abandoned house was blown off and several windows were blown out.  Also, there was lots of tree damage in the area.  The damage was rated EF1 in this location.  The tornado continued to the east northeast.  On Madison County Road 431, about a mile north of the intersection with Highway C, a home was completely blown apart and swept off the foundation.  The debris was thrown in different directions.  It was not bolted down into the concrete foundation, only nailed, so the EF rating given for this was EF2.  All the hardwood trees next to the home were uprooted.  The width of the damage path in this location was 200 yards.  Further to the east additional tree damage was found on Madison County Road 411 near the intersection with Highway EE.  As it travelled to the east northeast, the tornado approached U.S. Highway 67 near Zion.  On the west side of U.S. Highway 67, about a third of a mile north of the intersection with Highway JJ, an abandoned single wide mobile home was rolled onto its roof.  A bit further north of the mobile home, there was about a 100 yard wide swath of hardwoods that were uprooted on the west side of U.S. Highway 67.  All of the damage in this area was rated EF1.  Further to the east, about 1.6 miles west northwest of Marquand on Highway A, there was significant roof damage to a large well-constructed barn.  There was some evidence of convergent flow in the tree damage nearby.  A utility pole was bent over back to the south.  Just to the east of the tree damage, about half the roof was lifted off of a business and numerous large oaks were uprooted in the area.  Damage width was about 200 yards in this location with a rating of EF1.  On Highway F, about two tenths of a mile north of the intersection with Highway A, a large swath of trees was uprooted, with additional sporadic tree damage along the rest of the path before crossing into Bollinger County (WFO Paducah���s forecast area) about a mile and a half northeast of Marquand on the south side of Highway A at 320 am.  The path length in Madison County was 21.54 miles with a max width of 200 yards and a max rating of EF2.  Overall, the tornado was on the ground for 31.88 miles with a max width of 800 yards and a max rating of EF2.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Road 424) at 255 am.  At this location part of the roof of an abandoned house was blown off and several windows were blown out.  Also, there was lots of tree damage in the area.  The damage was rated EF1 in this location.  The tornado continued to the east northeast.  On Madison County Road 431, about a mile north of the intersection with Highway C, a home was completely blown apart and swept off the foundation.  The debris was thrown in different directions.  It was not bolted down into the concrete foundation, only nailed, so the EF rating given for this was EF2.  All the hardwood trees next to the home were uprooted.  The width of the damage path in this location was 200 yards.  Further to the east additional tree damage was found on Madison County Road 411 near the intersection with Highway EE.  As it travelled to the east northeast, the tornado approached U.S. Highway 67 near Zion.  On the west side of U.S. Highway 67, about a third of a mile north of the intersection with Highway JJ, an abandoned single wide mobile home was rolled onto its roof.  A bit further north of the mobile home, there was about a 100 yard wide swath of hardwoods that were uprooted on the west side of U.S. Highway 67.  All of the damage in this area was rated EF1.  Further to the east, about 1.6 miles west northwest of Marquand on Highway A, there was significant roof damage to a large well-constructed barn.  There was some evidence of convergent flow in the tree damage nearby.  A utility pole was bent over back to the south.  Just to the east of the tree damage, about half the roof was lifted off of a business and numerous large oaks were uprooted in the area.  Damage width was about 200 yards in this location with a rating of EF1.  On Highway F, about two tenths of a mile north of the intersection with Highway A, a large swath of trees was uprooted, with additional sporadic tree damage along the rest of the path before crossing into Bollinger County (WFO Paducah���s forecast area) about a mile and a half northeast of Marquand on the south side of Highway A at 320 am.  The path length in Madison County was 21.54 miles with a max width of 200 yards and a max rating of EF2.  Overall, the tornado was on the ground for 31.88 miles with a max width of 800 yards and a max rating of EF2.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado moved northeast across a subdivision snapping or uprooting a number of trees and damaging homes. About 450 yards wide, it then moved across a commercial area on the west side of Rogers where it removed part of the roof of a commercial building, blew large glass windows out of another commercial building, damaged a number of other buildings, snapped or uprooted a number of trees, and snapped power poles. Debris impacted a vehicle, impaling the windshield with a piece of 2x4 wood and shattering several of the windows. Two people were injured by glass and flying debris in the vehicle. Damage in this area indicated the wind speed in the tornado was as much as 90 to 100 mph. ||The tornado then crossed I-540 and went across another subdivision of homes. Many trees were snapped or uprooted and homes were damaged. Tree damage became less concentrated for a bit after the tornado crossed Highway 94, but was intermittently still in the EF-1 category. Damage northeast of Avoca was once again very concentrated with a number of snapped or uprooted trees as well as home and barn damage. It dissipated in the southern portion of the Pea Ridge National Military Park.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Twelve hours later, Tropical Depression Nine had strengthened into Tropical Storm Isaac. Isaac continued to track through the eastern Caribbean Sea and Florida Straits while maintaining high end tropical storm strength. Just before noon central time on the 28th, Isaac was located about 75 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River(or about 160 miles southeast of New Orleans) and was found to have reached hurricane strength with winds of 75mph. An outer rain band from Isaac brought some showers to portions of the ArkLaMiss during the afternoon of the 28th, while the center of Isaac was still churning in the Gulf of Mexico. At 6:45pm on August 28th, Hurricane Isaac made a brief landfall along the coast of Southeast Louisiana in Plaquemines Parish. Maximum sustained winds were 80mph at this landfall. Isaac did not remain over land for long as he was back over water again by 9:00pm that same evening. Isaac made his second landfall along the coast of southeast Louisiana, just to the west of Port Fourchon, around 2:15am August 29th, again with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph. ||Isaac moved very slowly to the north and northwest over the course of August 29th, which made for prolonged impacts. Forward motion of about 5 mph lead to tremendous flooding issues for both Louisiana and portions of Mississippi south of I-20.

Storm total rainfall across portions of Marion County indicated at least 10 to 15 inches fell. Numerous homes and buildings were flooded and some water rescues occurred in Lamar, Marion and Clarke counties. Further to the north, flooding issues were not quite as bad with about 5 to 7 inches of rain falling from the I-20 corridor and north. Tropical storm force wind gusts were noted as far north as Bolivar County, with the Golden Triangle region not seeing winds reach more than tropical depression strength. The worst of the wind was felt generally along and south of an axis from Marion County to Adams County. Numerous trees were down in Adams County, leaving many without power for several days. Eighty percent of the roads were blocked in Franklin County due to downed trees. ||With all of the rain that fell, some of the area rivers filled quickly. Minor flooding was recorded on the lower Pearl River at Rockport and Monticello, as well as on Bouie Creek at Hattiesburg and Tallahala Creek at Laurel. The biggest river impact in the Jackson Hydrologic Service Area was on Black Creek at Brooklyn. Black Creek entered moderate flooding and finally crested at 26.71 feet on August 31st at 5pm. This will go down as the second highest crest in history for this particular river and forecast point.

The thin line of low-topped thunderstorms developed in a convective environment characterized by weak instability and strong wind shear. A weak surface wave near BWI along a north-south cold front aided in the threat of damaging winds and embedded weak tornadoes along the QLCS. ||An extensive ground and aerial storm survey was conducted on October 20, 2012. The survey team consisted of NWS meteorologists along with Lancaster County emergency management officials, local township coordinators and private weather consultant Dr. John Scala. The PSP provided the helicopter for the aerial portion of the storm survey. ||The survey concluded that an embedded EF1 tornado in straight-line winds gusting to 100 to 110 mph occurred at multiple locations along a line of storm damage from near Fernglen in Drumore Township northeastward for over 16 miles to near Paradise in Paradise Township from approximately 2000 to 2025 EDT. From the air, an estimated 50 structures appeared to have significant damage especially to roofs.  Several barns were completely collapsed. Along the storm damage path, swaths of trees were leveled especially those along the hillsides of valleys and within ravines. As a conservative estimate, several thousand trees were downed. The tree damage had mostly a SW to NE orientation except in areas where tornadic convergence and circulation were evident. ||The Lancaster EMA estimated between 5-7 million dollars in damages related to the EF1 tornado. There were 15 people injured by the tornado who were standing under an open-air pavilion at Paradise Park.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The National Weather Service in State College, PA along with Lancaster County Emergency Management officials conducted a storm survey in the southwestern part of Lancaster County. The survey confirmed an EF1 tornado affected portions of southwest and south-central Lancaster County during the late evening on October 19, 2012.  Maximum winds were estimated between 100 and 110 mph.  The path length was approximately 16 miles and the maximum width was 200 yards. ||The tornado first touched down near Fern Glen in southwest Lancaster County, then|traveled northeast to near Paradise. The tornado damage was sporadic and embedded within a larger area of straight line wind damage that extended from Fern Glen in Drumore Township to Paradise City in Paradise Township. It is estimated that the tornado touched down around 2000 pm EDT, skipped along to the northeast and lifted back up for the final time at around 2025 pm EDT. The damage path was not c continuous, as the tornado touched down and lifted up a number of times. ||The locations with the most recognizable tornadic signature damage from the air were as follows from south to north: 1) Near Fernglen with evidence of strong convergent storm damage 2) Near Liberty Square with a clearly-defined convergent wind pattern in the corn field and nearby tree and structure damage 3) About 1.5 miles southwest of Buck where 3 medium-sized high tension electric transmission towers were knocked down from south to north 4) About 2 miles west-northwest of Quarryville along Cinder road were swaths of trees were downed with convergent signatures and multiple structures were damaged 5) About 3-3.5 miles south of Strasburg from near Weaver road to White Oak road where convergent patterns of trees downed with structure damage and a collapsed barn 6) About 2 miles southeast of Strasburg near Reservoir Road were a convergent pattern of snapped tree trunks were evident.||The storm produced 15 injuries, all in the city of Paradise where a open-air horse pavilion collapsed at Paradise Park. Along the path, approximately 50 structures were damaged, and several barns destroyed. An estimated 2000 to 3000 trees were knocked down, along with 2 small high tension towers in the Buck area. Initial estimates from County Emergency Management put damage in the 5 to 7 million dollar range.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 6.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The thin line of low-topped thunderstorms developed in a convective environment characterized by weak instability and strong wind shear. A weak surface wave near BWI along a north-south cold front aided in the threat of damaging winds and embedded weak tornadoes along the QLCS. ||An extensive ground and aerial storm survey was conducted on October 20, 2012. The survey team consisted of NWS meteorologists along with Lancaster County emergency management officials, local township coordinators and private weather consultant Dr. John Scala. The PSP provided the helicopter for the aerial portion of the storm survey. ||The survey concluded that an embedded EF1 tornado in straight-line winds gusting to 100 to 110 mph occurred at multiple locations along a line of storm damage from near Fernglen in Drumore Township northeastward for over 16 miles to near Paradise in Paradise Township from approximately 2000 to 2025 EDT. From the air, an estimated 50 structures appeared to have significant damage especially to roofs.  Several barns were completely collapsed. Along the storm damage path, swaths of trees were leveled especially those along the hillsides of valleys and within ravines. As a conservative estimate, several thousand trees were downed. The tree damage had mostly a SW to NE orientation except in areas where tornadic convergence and circulation were evident. ||The Lancaster EMA estimated between 5-7 million dollars in damages related to the EF1 tornado. There were 15 people injured by the tornado who were standing under an open-air pavilion at Paradise Park.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The National Weather Service in State College, PA along with Lancaster County Emergency Management officials conducted a storm survey in the southwestern part of Lancaster County.

Tornadoes struck Menifee, Morgan, Bath, Wolfe, Laurel, Johnson and Martin Counties causing a combined 16 deaths in those counties. The hardest hit areas were West Liberty in Morgan county, Salyersville in Magoffin county, and East Bernstadt in Laurel county. One of the strongest tornadoes in this outbreak, rated at EF-3 with winds estimated at 140 mph, caused extensive damage in Menifee and Morgan counties. This tornado killed 2 people in Menifee county and took an additional 6 lives in Morgan county. The town of West Liberty was particularly hard hit, with every building in the downtown area suffering some degree of damage. Several homes were swept off their foundations. ||A second EF-3 tornado touched down in extreme southeast Wolfe County and cut a path of damage across portions of Magoffin, Johnson, and Martin Counties. This twister was at its most intense strength in Magoffin and Johnson Counties, with winds estimated at 160 mph. This tornado caused catastrophic damage in parts of Salyersville. This second tornado killed 2 people in Johnson County. ||A third strong tornado caused extensive damage in and near the community of East Bernstadt in Laurel County. This tornado was rated at EF-2 and caused 6 fatalities. Most of these deaths occurred when several trailer homes were picked up and destroyed by the tornado. ||An EF-1 tornado was also confirmed in Bath County. This tornado caused extensive damage to trees, farm buildings and residences along its track. Fortunately, no deaths or injuries occurred as a result of this tornado. ||The storms that occurred on March 2nd also produced very large hail. Reports were received of hailstones as big as baseballs. Extensive damage to trees and structures due to thunderstorm wind gusts also occurred. To top it all off, the heavy rain produced by the large and powerful thunderstorms lead to flash flooding in several counties where tornadoes also occurred.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A storm damage survey team from the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Jackson, Kentucky confirmed that an EF-3 tornado occurred in Menifee County on March 2, 2012. The tornado touched down on Tarr Ridge about 2 miles southwest of Mariba at 539 pm EST. The tornado then tracked east-northeast crossing highway 77 and causing extensive damage to several homes.  The most extensive damage in Menifee County occurred on Opossum Hollow Road, where several structures were destroyed including a brick house which was totally destroyed except for the basement.  The tornado crossed highway 460 just southeast of Wellington and continued into Morgan County.  Two fatalities occurred in Menifee County as a direct result of the tornado.  One other fatality occurred due to a fall down stairs in the clean-up effort following the tornado.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This twister was at its most intense strength in Magoffin and Johnson Counties, with winds estimated at 160 mph. This tornado caused catastrophic damage in parts of Salyersville. This second tornado killed 2 people in Johnson County. ||A third strong tornado caused extensive damage in and near the community of East Bernstadt in Laurel County. This tornado was rated at EF-2 and caused 6 fatalities. Most of these deaths occurred when several trailer homes were picked up and destroyed by the tornado. ||An EF-1 tornado was also confirmed in Bath County. This tornado caused extensive damage to trees, farm buildings and residences along its track. Fortunately, no deaths or injuries occurred as a result of this tornado. ||The storms that occurred on March 2nd also produced very large hail. Reports were received of hailstones as big as baseballs. Extensive damage to trees and structures due to thunderstorm wind gusts also occurred. To top it all off, the heavy rain produced by the large and powerful thunderstorms lead to flash flooding in several counties where tornadoes also occurred.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A storm damage survey team from the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Jackson, Kentucky confirmed that an EF-3 tornado tracked from Menifee County into Morgan County on March 2, 2012. The tornado entered Morgan County at around 546 pm EST, just to the northwest of Ezel, and tracked east-northeast making a direct hit on downtown West Liberty at around 558 pm EST. The tornado caused extensive damage to nearly every structure in town, including the 105 year old courthouse, the depression-era WPA building that houses the community center and the 100 year old West Liberty United Methodist and Christian churches. The tornado continued northeast from West Liberty through the remainder of Morgan County, causing extensive damage to numerous structures and downing thousands of trees with a consistent path width of 3/4 to 1 mile throughout the county.  Estimated peak winds in Morgan County were 140 mph. The tornado crossed into Lawrence county at 610 pm EST between Moon and Terryville.  Six fatalities occurred in Morgan county as a direct result of the tornado.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 75.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Initially the tornado tracked southeast downing multiple trees as it crossed Harrison Road and MS Highway 21. There were also a few homes with roof damage in this area and outbuildings were damaged by fallen trees. The tornado then began a more easterly course along Greer Road and began to snap and uproot several additional trees as it crossed Ephesus Road, Langsmill Road, and Russell Community Road. Along Russell Community Road multiple trees fell on structures, including one that fell through a home causing an injury. The tornado continued eastward, downing additional trees and caused minor roof damage at a residence on George Road.||As the tornado reached the Lewis Road area, there was a notable increase in the number of hardwood trees that were snapped along the path. Along the northern end of the track, part of the roof of a small barn was removed. Extensive tree damage continued to the Salem Road area, where the tornado reached its peak intensity of around 140 mph. At this location, three large steel transmission towers were bent toward the ground between Salem Road and Jim Owens Road. Along Jim Owens Road, a large shed and a travel trailer were demolished. Farther east the tornado blew a mobile home into the roadway at Conehatta Road. The roof and walls were separated from the undercarriage and the contents of the home were scattered in the area. There were two occupants in the home at the time, and both escaped without significant injury. Along Stroud Road portions of the roof of an outbuilding were removed and a small silo was blown over before the tornado crossed into Newton County.||The tornado crossed Tuscolameta Creek, continuing to uproot and snap several trees as it passed over the southern end of the town of Conehatta. A small shed was demolished along Hoye Pace Road. Additional homes suffered roof damage along Newton-Conehatta Road and Caney Creek Road. One mobile home was shifted off its foundation and an adjacent barn had much of its metal roof removed. An outbuilding was destroyed by a falling tree along Woodrow Ezell Road. Farther east, much of a metal roof was removed from a shed along Pleasant Valley Road and a home sustained roof damage along Braddock Road. Additional tree damage occurred as the tornado tracked eastward nearly paralleling Braddock Road before lifting near Beaver Dam Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The combination of intense wind shear, strong winds and adequate moisture and instability resulted in severe storms developing along and ahead of a strong cold front as it raced across the forecast area. Numerous reports of wind damage from supercell and bowing-type thunderstorms were received as the storms produced strong straight line winds and tornadoes from the Delta region, southeast into Central Mississippi, and reaching into parts of east central and southeast Mississippi. There were sporadic reports of hail, but with such fierce wind shear over the region, straight line winds and tornadoes were the primary modes of severe weather during this event.||To put some historical perspective on this rare early Fall severe weather event, the EF-3 that occurred across Scott and Newton counties was only the second F3 to occur in the month of October in Mississippi in recorded history. The three strong tornadoes for this event is second all time to the Oct 17, 1980 event where 7 tornadoes occurred (6 of which were strong (F2)). Additionally, there were eleven total tornadoes during this event which ties October 13, 2001 for the most tornadoes during any October event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado began along Old Jackson Road east of Hillsboro. Initially the tornado tracked southeast downing multiple trees as it crossed Harrison Road and MS Highway 21. There were also a few homes with roof damage in this area and outbuildings were damaged by fallen trees. The tornado then began a more easterly course along Greer Road and began to snap and uproot several additional trees as it crossed Ephesus Road, Langsmill Road, and Russell Community Road. Along Russell Community Road multiple trees fell on structures, including one that fell through a home causing an injury. The tornado continued eastward, downing additional trees and caused minor roof damage at a residence on George Road.||As the tornado reached the Lewis Road area, there was a notable increase in the number of hardwood trees that were snapped along the path. Along the northern end of the track, part of the roof of a small barn was removed. Extensive tree damage continued to the Salem Road area, where the tornado reached its peak intensity of around 140 mph. At this location, three large steel transmission towers were bent toward the ground between Salem Road and Jim Owens Road. Along Jim Owens Road, a large shed and a travel trailer were demolished. Farther east the tornado blew a mobile home into the roadway at Conehatta Road. The roof and walls were separated from the undercarriage and the contents of the home were scattered in the area. There were two occupants in the home at the time, and both escaped without significant injury. Along Stroud Road portions of the roof of an outbuilding were removed and a small silo was blown over before the tornado crossed into Newton County.||The tornado crossed Tuscolameta Creek, continuing to uproot and snap several trees as it passed over the southern end of the town of Conehatta. A small shed was demolished along Hoye Pace Road. Additional homes suffered roof damage along Newton-Conehatta Road and Caney Creek Road. One mobile home was shifted off its foundation and an adjacent barn had much of its metal roof removed. An outbuilding was destroyed by a falling tree along Woodrow Ezell Road. Farther east, much of a metal roof was removed from a shed along Pleasant Valley Road and a home sustained roof damage along Braddock Road. Additional tree damage occurred as the tornado tracked eastward nearly paralleling Braddock Road before lifting near Beaver Dam Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This damage occurred at the west end of Barley Circle. Most of the damage in the rest of the subdivision was EF1 to EF2. Based on the damage surveyed, the maximum wind speed of this tornado while in Grant County was estimated at 145 miles per hour. After traveling 1.33 miles on the ground in Grant County, the tornado then crossed into Kenton County at 1624 EST. Immediately as the tornado crossed west to east of Interstate 75, it strengthened to EF4 level. Five single family homes were destroyed down to their foundations in this area, with at least two of these homes having strapping or bolting to their foundations. The EF4 damage continued to the north end of Lexington Pike, where 2 homes and multiple outbuildings were completely destroyed. Both homes were brick structures with foundation bolting or strapping. The EF4 winds continued across Route 25 and ended near the Bagby Road area. At least 2 vehicles were carried, with one carried over 1800 feet. Trees were stripped of nearly all branches, with much of the bark also stripped. All 4 fatalities with this tornado occurred within the area of EF4 damage. As the tornado headed further to the east northeast, high end EF3 damage continued through other properties along Bagby Road, to Carlisle, Parker Grove, and Paxton Roads. Numerous double and single wide homes were destroyed, with both brick and siding structures left with collapsed exterior walls and either all or a large percentage of the roof removed. The tornado continued the east northeast path into southeast Kenton County, to the Licking River near Morning View. Damage in the Morning View area was consistent with EF1 to EF2 damage to near the Campbell County line, where the tornado lifted at 1632 EST after traveling 8.52 miles in Kenton County. Based on the damage surveyed, the maximum wind speed from this tornado while in Kenton County was estimated at 175 miles per hour. This storm produced an earlier tornado in southern Indiana. Debris, possibly from that tornado, was later observed falling from the sky across Boone County, Kentucky.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The EF4 damage continued to the north end of Lexington Pike, where 2 homes and multiple outbuildings were completely destroyed. Both homes were brick structures with foundation bolting or strapping. The EF4 winds continued across Route 25 and ended near the Bagby Road area. At least 2 vehicles were carried, with one carried over 1800 feet. Trees were stripped of nearly all branches, with much of the bark also stripped. All 4 fatalities with this tornado occurred within the area of EF4 damage. As the tornado headed further to the east northeast, high end EF3 damage continued through other properties along Bagby Road, to Carlisle, Parker Grove, and Paxton Roads. Numerous double and single wide homes were destroyed, with both brick and siding structures left with collapsed exterior walls and either all or a large percentage of the roof removed. The tornado continued the east northeast path into southeast Kenton County, to the Licking River near Morning View. Damage in the Morning View area was consistent with EF1 to EF2 damage to near the Campbell County line, where the tornado lifted at 1632 EST after traveling 8.52 miles in Kenton County. Based on the damage surveyed, the maximum wind speed from this tornado while in Kenton County was estimated at 175 miles per hour. This storm produced an earlier tornado in southern Indiana. Debris, possibly from that tornado, was later observed falling from the sky across Boone County, Kentucky.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An EF-3 tornado tore through the town of Forney, heavily damaging homes in the Diamond Creek subdivision. Three EF-2 tornadoes damaged parts of Arlington and Kennedale in Tarrant County; Red Oak, Lancaster, and Dallas in Ellis and Dallas counties; and Royse City in Rockwall and Hunt counties. An EF-1 tornado caused damage near Joshua in Johnson County, and the remaining 12 tornadoes were rated EF-0s. In addition to the tornadoes, large hail damaged many parts of the DFW Metroplex. Approximately 110 airplanes at DFW International Airport were damaged by the hail and taken out of service until repaired. No fatalities occurred and only 29 people were injured. Of the 29 injuries, only 3 were considered serious but everyone made a full recovery.  The environmental set-up on this day consisted of a cut-off low over New Mexico with a front draped north-to-south across the western counties of the CWA. By mid to late morning, strong and severe storms developed along the front as a lobe of energy rotated into west Texas and forcing from this energy overspread the front. The atmosphere was already unstable and uncapped by this time. In addition, a Mesoscale Convective System in Oklahoma sent an outflow boundary south across the Red River. This outflow boundary moved south of the DFW Metroplex by the late morning hours, and isolated storms began to develop south of the outflow boundary but east of the front. As these storms moved north and crossed the outflow boundary, the low level rotation increased and the storms quickly became tornadic. All of the tornadic storms were tied to this outflow boundary as it retreated north as a warm front.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF-3 tornado did extensive damage as it wound its way through the town of Forney. The tornado began near the intersection of Broad St and N Bois D'arc Street just southwest of Highway 80. As it moved to the northeast, the first significant damage was noted near Aimee St and N Bois D'arc St. There was substantial tree damage with some large trees uprooted near this intersection. Also, shingle damage, roof damage to a fire station nearby, blown out windows at a few homes and an outbuilding was destroyed, all near this intersection.  A street sign at the intersection was also completely bent flat near the base. The tornado moved northeast and crossed Hwy 80 near the Forney Cleaners business where substantial roof and commercial sign damage occurred.  Debris was also observed in the median between the east and westbound lanes near this location. The tornado continued northeast producing light damage to industrial buildings, but was largely over open fields. The tornado then crossed over Ridgecrest Rd and produced substantial damage to many homes in the Diamond Creek subdivision. One of the first homes struck was on Woodberry Dr and was completely destroyed.  Several more homes were destroyed in this subdivision and other homes sustained substantial damage. It was determined that several of the destroyed homes were destroyed as the result of excessive lift being forced upon the roof, and the roofs of these homes were poorly attached to the external walls of the home. Once the roofs failed, pressure built up on internal walls causing the failure of nearly all external and internal walls. As the tornado continued northeast through the subdivision it consistently produced damage to homes, most of which was different degrees of roof or top floor damage. The tornado exited the subdivision at Crosby Elementary School. The tornado damaged several vehicles that were in the school���s parking lot. One vehicle was lofted approximately 300 yards into a field northeast of the school. The school itself sustained mainly roof damage.  Children were in the school when the tornado struck, but no injuries occurred.  The tornado continued northeast for several miles, producing light/EF-0 damage along the way. In total, this tornado destroyed 14 homes, caused major damage to 28 homes and minor damage to another 42 homes. Many of the damaged homes were in the Diamond Creek Subdivision.

An EF-3 tornado tore through the town of Forney, heavily damaging homes in the Diamond Creek subdivision. Three EF-2 tornadoes damaged parts of Arlington and Kennedale in Tarrant County; Red Oak, Lancaster, and Dallas in Ellis and Dallas counties; and Royse City in Rockwall and Hunt counties. An EF-1 tornado caused damage near Joshua in Johnson County, and the remaining 12 tornadoes were rated EF-0s. In addition to the tornadoes, large hail damaged many parts of the DFW Metroplex. Approximately 110 airplanes at DFW International Airport were damaged by the hail and taken out of service until repaired. No fatalities occurred and only 29 people were injured. Of the 29 injuries, only 3 were considered serious but everyone made a full recovery.  The environmental set-up on this day consisted of a cut-off low over New Mexico with a front draped north-to-south across the western counties of the CWA. By mid to late morning, strong and severe storms developed along the front as a lobe of energy rotated into west Texas and forcing from this energy overspread the front. The atmosphere was already unstable and uncapped by this time. In addition, a Mesoscale Convective System in Oklahoma sent an outflow boundary south across the Red River. This outflow boundary moved south of the DFW Metroplex by the late morning hours, and isolated storms began to develop south of the outflow boundary but east of the front. As these storms moved north and crossed the outflow boundary, the low level rotation increased and the storms quickly became tornadic. All of the tornadic storms were tied to this outflow boundary as it retreated north as a warm front.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF-3 tornado did extensive damage as it wound its way through the town of Forney. The tornado began near the intersection of Broad St and N Bois D'arc Street just southwest of Highway 80. As it moved to the northeast, the first significant damage was noted near Aimee St and N Bois D'arc St. There was substantial tree damage with some large trees uprooted near this intersection. Also, shingle damage, roof damage to a fire station nearby, blown out windows at a few homes and an outbuilding was destroyed, all near this intersection.  A street sign at the intersection was also completely bent flat near the base. The tornado moved northeast and crossed Hwy 80 near the Forney Cleaners business where substantial roof and commercial sign damage occurred.  Debris was also observed in the median between the east and westbound lanes near this location. The tornado continued northeast producing light damage to industrial buildings, but was largely over open fields. The tornado then crossed over Ridgecrest Rd and produced substantial damage to many homes in the Diamond Creek subdivision. One of the first homes struck was on Woodberry Dr and was completely destroyed.  Several more homes were destroyed in this subdivision and other homes sustained substantial damage. It was determined that several of the destroyed homes were destroyed as the result of excessive lift being forced upon the roof, and the roofs of these homes were poorly attached to the external walls of the home. Once the roofs failed, pressure built up on internal walls causing the failure of nearly all external and internal walls. As the tornado continued northeast through the subdivision it consistently produced damage to homes, most of which was different degrees of roof or top floor damage. The tornado exited the subdivision at Crosby Elementary School. The tornado damaged several vehicles that were in the school���s parking lot. One vehicle was lofted approximately 300 yards into a field northeast of the school. The school itself sustained mainly roof damage.  Children were in the school when the tornado struck, but no injuries occurred.  The tornado continued northeast for several miles, producing light/EF-0 damage along the way. In total, this tornado destroyed 14 homes, caused major damage to 28 homes and minor damage to another 42 homes. Many of the damaged homes were in the Diamond Creek Subdivision. Due to damage in the Diamond Creek Subdivision, the maximum estimated winds with this tornado were 150 mph. The path length was approximately 7.7 miles, and the maximum width was 150 yards. Seven people sustained non life-threatening injuries.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In its occlusion phase, the tornado curved back to the northwest; ending its track near the east shores of Lake Arlington along Waterview Drive. The path length of the tornado was 6.4 miles long with a width of approximately 150 yards.  Damage from the tornado began near the Texas Raceway. Five manufactured homes were heavily damaged or destroyed near the racing strip. Moving to the north-northeast, the tornado produced sporadic damage to trees, power poles, and a storage facility as the storm organized rapidly. Part of the roof of a warehouse at a business on Tower Drive near Business 287 was torn off and tossed onto a city water tower nearby. The warehouse was also damaged by debris tossed by the tornado. Other businesses near this intersection were also damaged. Damage to residences began north of Sublett Rd. EF-2 damage was noted to a few homes between Sublett Rd and Hwy 287, but most areas received EF-0 or EF-1 damage. Approximately 143 homes and apartments sustained some type of damage in this area. Most of the homes appeared to have the initial failure at or near the garage, with subsequent damage coming to exterior walls or portions of roofs. Before the tornado crossed Hwy 287, it damaged the roofs of two buildings at the Chesterfield Apartments. Once the tornado crossed Hwy 287, it cut a path to the north-northeast causing mostly minor roof and fence damage to approximately 25-30 homes between Hwy 287 and Interstate 20. The tornado crossed Interstate 20 between Kelly Elliott Rd and Green Oaks Blvd. First the tornado damaged a church on the north side of the interstate, then the tornado went on to do significant damage in the Oldfield neighborhood just north of Interstate 20 near Martin High School. Approximately 100 homes were damaged in this neighborhood with an additional 85 damaged in the surrounding areas. Several homes experienced significant damage to garages and progressive failure of garage walls and portions of roofs. A few residences in this neighborhood along Haverford Dr and Thorncliffe Dr sustained EF-2 damage. Large trees were also uprooted in the neighborhood. The damage path continued to the north from this area with several other homes and trees sustaining damage near Little Road. Just west of Martin High School, the tornado began to occlude and turn northwest. At this point, near Green Oaks Boulevard and Chaperito Street, a nursing home suffered significant roof and outside wall damage, with the initial failure occurring near a large window. Nearly all of the residential damage in Kennedale and Arlington was EF-0 or EF-1. Only a small portion of the damage path suffered EF-2 damage. A total of 5 homes in Kennedale and 13 homes in Arlington were determined to be destroyed. Another 44 homes sustained major damage and 247 sustained minor damage. An additional 273 residences were affected by the storms on this day. Maximum estimated winds with the tornado were 135 mph. Eight people sustained injuries from the tornado, but only one of those injured was considered severe.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An EF-3 tornado tore through the town of Forney, heavily damaging homes in the Diamond Creek subdivision. Three EF-2 tornadoes damaged parts of Arlington and Kennedale in Tarrant County; Red Oak, Lancaster, and Dallas in Ellis and Dallas counties; and Royse City in Rockwall and Hunt counties. An EF-1 tornado caused damage near Joshua in Johnson County, and the remaining 12 tornadoes were rated EF-0s. In addition to the tornadoes, large hail damaged many parts of the DFW Metroplex. Approximately 110 airplanes at DFW International Airport were damaged by the hail and taken out of service until repaired. No fatalities occurred and only 29 people were injured. Of the 29 injuries, only 3 were considered serious but everyone made a full recovery.  The environmental set-up on this day consisted of a cut-off low over New Mexico with a front draped north-to-south across the western counties of the CWA. By mid to late morning, strong and severe storms developed along the front as a lobe of energy rotated into west Texas and forcing from this energy overspread the front. The atmosphere was already unstable and uncapped by this time. In addition, a Mesoscale Convective System in Oklahoma sent an outflow boundary south across the Red River. This outflow boundary moved south of the DFW Metroplex by the late morning hours, and isolated storms began to develop south of the outflow boundary but east of the front. As these storms moved north and crossed the outflow boundary, the low level rotation increased and the storms quickly became tornadic. All of the tornadic storms were tied to this outflow boundary as it retreated north as a warm front.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF-3 tornado began in eastern Rockwall County and traveled northeast into Hunt County before lifting. The tornado touched down to the southwest of the intersection of FM 548 and Bent Rd in Rockwall County. The tornado quickly moved into a subdivision and severely damaged or destroyed several homes. The worst of the damage in this subdivision occurred along Laci Ln. Trees and shrubs northeast of these houses by a half mile or so were completely debarked and had no vegetation remaining. The tornado continued northeast and produced damage to homes along Country Manor Rd. There was one house that had a large portion of its roof/top story completely removed.  A couple of small barns were also destroyed, one which contained a classic car which ended up blown into the back of a neighbor���s house.

The tornado did significant damage to homes just northeast of the apartment complex, beginning on Sunny Meadow Dr. However, the most significant damage occurred near the intersections of Wintergreen Rd, Telephone Rd, and North Dallas Ave. Many homes in this area were heavily damaged or destroyed. Some cars were pushed into fences, many trees and tree branches were knocked down, an RV was crumpled, and some fence boards penetrated homes. The Cedar Valley Christian Academy also sustained heavy damage when it lost an entire wall. The tornado continued northeast crossing Interstate 20 near Dynasty Drive.

An EF-3 tornado tore through the town of Forney, heavily damaging homes in the Diamond Creek subdivision. Three EF-2 tornadoes damaged parts of Arlington and Kennedale in Tarrant County; Red Oak, Lancaster, and Dallas in Ellis and Dallas counties; and Royse City in Rockwall and Hunt counties. An EF-1 tornado caused damage near Joshua in Johnson County, and the remaining 12 tornadoes were rated EF-0s. In addition to the tornadoes, large hail damaged many parts of the DFW Metroplex. Approximately 110 airplanes at DFW International Airport were damaged by the hail and taken out of service until repaired. No fatalities occurred and only 29 people were injured. Of the 29 injuries, only 3 were considered serious but everyone made a full recovery.  The environmental set-up on this day consisted of a cut-off low over New Mexico with a front draped north-to-south across the western counties of the CWA. By mid to late morning, strong and severe storms developed along the front as a lobe of energy rotated into west Texas and forcing from this energy overspread the front. The atmosphere was already unstable and uncapped by this time. In addition, a Mesoscale Convective System in Oklahoma sent an outflow boundary south across the Red River. This outflow boundary moved south of the DFW Metroplex by the late morning hours, and isolated storms began to develop south of the outflow boundary but east of the front. As these storms moved north and crossed the outflow boundary, the low level rotation increased and the storms quickly became tornadic. All of the tornadic storms were tied to this outflow boundary as it retreated north as a warm front.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF-0 tornado with maximum estimated winds around 85 mph occurred in Mesquite. The tornado began near Independence Drive and Meadow Lane then tracked east. Minor roof damage was noted along the track of the tornado and several large trees were split or had large branches broken off. Near the end of the track on the east side of N Galloway Ave, a car service station sustained significant damage. The winds from the tornado penetrated the building through the large service doors. The roof was ripped off the building and the back wall collapsed. The path length of this tornado was 0.3 miles with a width of about 30 yards. Two people sustained minor injuries.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Meanwhile, a dry slot formed ahead of this feature allowing for increased instability over the mountains and foothills and promoting the development of discrete supercell storms. The storms evolved into a quasi-linear convective system as they moved east across central and southside Virginia. The storms displayed considerable rotation on radar and over a half dozen tornado warnings were issued although no tornadoes were reported. The hail reports from this event were prolific with numerous reports of quarter to golfball size and some almost as big as baseballs. Other reports were of  pea to marble size hail covering the ground to depths of 4 to 6 inches. Rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches were also common with local amounts of 3 to 5 inches causing flash flooding. There was flood fatality in Buckingham County where the driver tried to cross a low-water crossing at a flooded stream and the vehicle was carried downstream. The excessive runoff also resulted in minor river flooding along parts of the lower Roanoke and Dan Rivers. The USGS gauge on the Falling River near Naruna in Campbell County rose almost 10 feet in 6 hours, cresting at 14.42 feet (Flood Stage - 11') early on the 25th. 48-hour rain gauge totals ending 8 AM EDT on March 25th included 4.23 at Raven Rock Church IFLOWS (Patrick County), 4.13 at Ferrum IFLOWS (Franklin Co.), 3.95 at Slate Mtn, IFLOWS (Floyd Co.) and 3.51 at Doe Run Church IFLOWS (Patrick Co.).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rainfall of 2 to 4 inches in several hours caused several small streams to flood including Greasy Creek southwest of Buckingham. After the flooding receded, the County Sheriff's Office said deputies found a deceased 61-year-old woman inside a pickup truck several days after she was reported missing. The truck was found on its side and wedged against a tree, about 300 yards from a dirt driveway that crossed Grease Creek. The sheriff's office said a preliminary investigation indicated that flood waters disabled the truck and carried it downstream when the driver tried to drive across the flooded low-water crossing.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A Flash Flood Warning was issued for Wickenburg at about 5 pm in the afternoon. According to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department, a 65 year old man died as he attempted to drive across the Hassayampa wash/river near Wickenburg. As he attempted to drive through the wash, the swiftly flowing water carried his vehicle about one quarter of a mile downstream and into some brush, causing him to drown. No other details were made available. In addition to the fatality, crews were dispatched to four water rescues during the evening hours on Saturday according to Kevin Pool of the Wickenburg Fire Department.  One such rescue occurred north of town along US highway 93 in a neighborhood near a wash. In that incident the person was rescued from the top of his vehicle by sheriff's helicopter and taken to a hospital for observation.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A couple of strong storms developed by mid afternoon along this boundary and brought isolated wind damage to the Bluegrass Region. Later that afternoon, scattered severe storms developed under highly unstable conditions across southern Indiana, aided by the approach of a southward moving upper level disturbance. As these storms crossed the Ohio River, they grew upscale into several bowing segments. By evening, two of these segments merged south of Louisville into a squall line that brought widespread damaging winds to much of central Kentucky. Most locations experienced a strong gust front with at least 45 mph winds. Several Kentucky mesonet sites measured winds in excess of 58 mph.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Lightning struck a group of people out on the Ohio River, injuring one of them.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This complex was fueled by high temperatures that reached as high as around 100F and triggered by an approaching cold front. Numerous trees were knocked down. Dozens of cars were damaged and downed trees also damaged several homes. Hardest hit were southern Monmouth and northern Ocean Counties. Nearly 100,000 homes and businesses in the Jersey Central Power and Light and Atlantic City Electric's service area lost power.  A power outage caused people in Seaside Heights to be stuck on a sky ride as the severe thunderstorm moved through.  On the morning of the 8th, there were still about 18,000 customers without power. That dropped to 14,000 later that day. It took until the night of the 9th for power to be fully restored to everyone. Frequent cloud-to-ground lightning also occurred and one woman was struck and killed by lightning in Monmouth County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 48-year-old woman was struck by lightning in Monmouth Beach at the intersection of Ocean Avenue and Sunset Lane.

An 18 year old boy, a recent high school graduate, was attending a summer church camp.  The boy was struck by lightning while playing left field during a softball game.  The bolt passed through his entire body.  His hair was singed.  His tennis shoes had holes in them.  He fell to his back and was stiff as a board.  He was not breathing and did not have a pulse.  Fellow teammates performed CPR for about 10 to 15 minutes until EMS arrived.  He was taken to a local hospital, then transported to a Morgantown hospital.  Eventually, he was sent to a burn center in Pittsburgh.  A week later he was recovering.  He was to be moved to a rehabilitation center which was closer to home.||Two other players were knocked to the ground during the strike, but were not injured.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Two of the four supercells tracked through Dallas County causing over a billion dollars in hail damage. The hail in Dallas County ranged in sizes up to 3 in diameter. In many areas, the hail lasted for at least 30 minutes. Tens of thousands of cars were damaged by the hail, windows were shattered, roofs were damaged, and trees were shredded of their leaves. The Lakewood area of Dallas was one of the hardest hit areas. Part of the Lakewood Theater was damaged, and thousands of divots damaged the golf course at the Lakewood Country Club. Historic homes on Swiss Avenue sustained significant roof damage with roof repairs on a few homes estimated over $100,000. A glass exhibit at the Dallas Arboretum sustained damage that was described as relatively minor. This supercell continued to track into Ellis County producing hail damage down to Midlothian. The second supercell in Dallas County tracked from Irving into Cedar Hill. Another supercell produced an EF-0 tornado, 70-95 mph downburst winds, and softball sized hail in Fannin County. The fourth supercell produced hail up to 3.25 in diameter in Collin County. Damage estimates were estimated as high as $2 billion dollars for this event, but insurance companies anticipated the final damage totals to be around $1.1 billion.
