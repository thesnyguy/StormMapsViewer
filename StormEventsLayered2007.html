Severe weather during the overnight hours in June is quite rare but does occur on occasion. One of the overnight storms actually produced a rare June tornado! This overnight severe weather was likely a sign and just a taste of what was to come during the day on June 19th. As the overnight/early morning complex of storms shifted east, conditions were set just right for additional storms to redevelop to the west by late morning. The atmosphere recovered once more and became quite unstable in the wake of the morning complex. A very potent disturbance dropped south out of Arkansas and developed a large bow echo complex which plowed south across the forecast area. This bow echo was very efficient at producing severe wind gusts and a large swath of wind damage occurred as the system moved southward across Mississippi into Southeast Louisiana.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A few trees were blown down around Eagle Lake.

At the same time, a large MCS developed over northern Nebraska and tracked east into southern Minnesota into northern Iowa.  The airmass was quite unstable over Iowa and favorable for elevated convection as the system moved in.  CAPE values remained in the 2000 to 3500 J/kg range along and south of the boundary with lifted indices in the -8 range.  The environment was quite strongly sheared with 50 to 60 kts of shear. The downdraft CAPE was in the 500 to 700 J/kg range.  Thunderstorms intensified as they moved across Iowa with a small bow echo element developing as the MCS began to interact with the frontal boundary.  The event took shape as it moved into north central Iowa and produced 60 to 70 MPH winds as it moved from Kossuth County, east-southeast toward Tama County.  Hail was limited with the event as the freezing level had not changed much from the previous day and was still in the 15,500 foot range.  One report of three-quarter inch diameter hail was received from Franklin County.  There were numerous reports of tree and power line damage.  Two semitrailer trucks were blown off of Interstate 35 in southwest Cerro Gordo County between mile post 185 and 186.  The two drivers received minor injuries.  Reported wind damage included several out buildings and at least two barns flattened by high winds. Some of the harder hit areas were in Bremer County in the Plainfield area.  Barns were blown down, along with numerous trees and power poles.  The roof of a convenience store was peeled back in Plainfield.  Damage extended along U.S. Highway 218 from Plainfield north to at least the Chickasaw County line.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Two semis were blown over between mile markers 185 and 186 on interstate 35.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Dew point temperatures rose to the mid 60s to near 70 by late afternoon.  The airmass became relatively unstable, however the dynamics were somewhat limited.  The effective shear was in the 25 to 35 kt range.  The freezing level was between 12,000 and 13,000 feet, however the sounding was quite saturated which limited the hail somewhat.  The CAPE in the -10 to -30 C. layer was in the 200 to 300 J/kg range with the most unstable CAPE in the 1000 to 2000 J/lg range.  Lifted indices were in the -2 to -4 C. range.  A slow moving cold front entered western Iowa from the west during the late afternoon.  Thunderstorms formed along the front and lifted northeast.  Many of the storms produced large amounts of pea size hail, however very few produced any significant size hail.  Most of the hail was in the three quarter to one inch diameter range.    A bow echo segment formed along the east edge of the system and produced scattered reports of high winds.  A semi-tractortrailer was blown off the highway along Interstate 80 at the Stuart exit.  The truck overturned, blocking the highway and injuring the driver.  He was flown to hospital in Des Moines.  High winds snapped power poles southwest of Britt.  A severe thunderstorm in the Lake Mills area produced what appears to be a downburst wind gust that took the roof off of a grain bin and blew down 6 power poles.   A short time later, the same segment produced 61 MPH winds at the Waterloo Airport.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was supported by a very deep polar low intensifying across southeast Canada.  Very warm, humid, and unstable conditions continued in advance of this winterlike cold front.  A squall line of thunderstorms developed during the afternoon of the 3rd from the Ohio Valley into the Tennessee Valley.

The path of damage was approximately one-half mile long and a mile wide.  At least 35 homes sustained roof and siding damage and dozens of large trees were blown down or completely uprooted in the area.  One home was blown 15 feet off its foundation and destroyed as it collapsed.  Windows were blown out of at least one home and several vehicles.  Other vehicles were damaged from downed trees or debris.  One man was injured when his locked and bolted door blew open with the winds and knocked him into a nearby wall.  There were reports of other trees down in the southern part of the county, but especially in the far southern part of the county near the Gwinnett county line.

An inverted V signature was noted above the 950 mb level on the 00Z KNKX sounding that afternoon, indicative of the potential for thunderstorms to produce microbursts. Three elderly fishermen drowned after their overloaded, 12-foot motorboat capsized on Lake Henshaw while trying to outrun an approaching thunderstorm. Eyewitness accounts and observations support the idea that this thunderstorm may have produced a minor, sub-severe microburst. This was probably all that was needed to capsize the small, overloaded boat. A friend of the fishermen was the first to notice the capsized boat, however he did not actually see the boat flip over. It is still not completely known if the boat capsized before or after the thunderstorm moved across the lake.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A Severe Thunderstorm Watch was issued at 6:10 PM CDT and remained in effect until 1 AM CDT and was then extended until 5 AM as the line continued to push south. Damage reports began reaching the office around 9:30 PM CDT (8:30 MDT) as the line entered the northwestern portion of the forecast area and continued until 3:30 AM CDT when the line exited the forecast area.||As the storm entered Lea County New Mexico, reports of wind speeds in excess of 70 mph began coming into the office. These high winds continued as the line surged forward into West Texas. In Seminole, 98 mph (measured) wind speeds toppled several radio towers including a 320 foot tower that fell on a church and bus damaging both. In addition, the roof of Beall's Department store was destroyed and two mobile homes were rolled and destroyed injuring four people. ||As the line continued its southward progression, so did the damaging winds. Many locations began experiencing power outages including two of the three television stations in the Midland/Odessa area, and Midland International Airport. WFO Midland and the Gaines County Emergency Operation Center continued working on back up generator power until commercial power was restored to the area.  A 93 mph wind gust was measured at Midland International Airport just prior to the power loss, which rendered it inoperable for the remainder of the night.||The event continued into the early morning hours on Wednesday, where Dryden reported a 63 mph wind gust prior to thunderstorms exiting the area.||Post storm damage surveys indicated that damage across the area was caused by a derecho. A derecho is a ���widespread and long-lived wind storm associated with a band of rapidly moving showers or thunderstorms.��� ||While straight-line winds are common across West Texas ��� especially during the late spring and early summer ��� the magnitude of the wind speeds for this event is quite rare. As an example, the 93 mph wind reported in Midland eclipsed the old record of 86 mph set in February 1960, and was the strongest wind ever recorded in Midland since the NWS began official record keeping in 1930.||During this long-lived weather episode, all but two of the 26 counties within WFO Midland���s CWA experienced severe weather. The majority of these locations experienced high wind events, which resulted in power outages across the area. Because of backup power capability, WFO Midland was able to maintain warning operations throughout the entire severe weather event.||Summary of measured wind reports:||Dryden (K6R6) - 55 kts (63 mph)|Big Spring (KBPG) - 51 kts (59 mph)|Fort Stockton (KFST) - 57 kts (66 mph)|Guadalupe Pass (KGDP) - 62 kts (71 mph)|Wink (KINK) - 58 kts (67 mph)|Midland (KMAF) - 81 kts (93 mph)*|Odessa (KODO) - 55 kts (63 mph)|Seagraves 1 SW (KSGV) - 66 kts (76 mph)|Andrews 2 E (KANS) - 51 kts (59 mph)*|Seminole 2 NNE (KSMS) - 85 kts (98 mph)*|Lamesa 2 SE (KLES) - 45 kts (52 mph)*|Gail 2 ESE (KGGS) - 43 kts (50 mph)*|Pecos (KPEQ) - 56 kts (64 mph)|McDonald Observatory - 61 kts (70 mph)|Tatum, NM Co-op Observer - 68 kts (78 mph)||*These sites lost power shortly after observations, it may be assumed that peak wind gusts were somewhat higher than observed.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey was conducted by NWS personnel the morning following the winds.  The results of the damage survey follow.||Winds were measured at 97.5 mph at the West Texas Mesonet site two miles north northeast of Seminole, however, there is visual indication that wind speeds in some locations around Seminole, were at times even stronger ��� estimated in the range of 100-120 mph. Communication tower damage, where a tower measuring 320 feet in height fell on a church and another tall tower was bent into the shape of a rectangle, both suggest higher wind speed estimates. Additionally, three miles east southeast of Seminole along County Road 402, at least eight wooden power poles were snapped just above the ground. This further supports the idea that winds were at times greater than 100 mph.||NWS personnel found many trees were uprooted and tree limbs down. The entire town of Seminole experienced damage, with areas just west of downtown and just east of town being hardest hit by the damaging winds.||The extent of the wind damage prompted the Gaines County EOC to request EMS/Fire assistance from Hobbs, NM. Included in the damage were two mobile homes that were rolled.  One of these homes had four people inside, including one infant.  All four were injured and the infant was kept for observation overnight at a Lubbock hospital. ||Backup generators at the Emergency Operations center lost power as well as commercial power to much of Seminole.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The church sustained roof damage...resulting in water damage to the church's interior. The more significant damage with the event occurred east of Interstate 65 at the Super Wal-Mart on the Interstate 65 Service Road.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Eye witness interviews, archived radar data, photographic evidence and media reports indicate that a thunderstorm downburst with peak winds of 70 mph, accompanied by a gustnado along the leading edge of the gustfront, was the cause of the damage that occurred in the vicinity of the I-65 and Dauphin Street interchange at around 120 pm CST on the afternoon of July 3.  |A short lived gustnado developed along the leading edge of the thunderstorm downburst near the Dauphin Way Baptist Church, just on the west side of I-65. Most reports indicate that the gustnado was visible along the gustfront for 30 to 60 seconds. Slight damage occurred to a couple of trees along Dauphin Street near the church. In that same area a car was damaged when it was pushed into a tree. The occupant of the car was wearing a seat belt and was uninjured, but the back window of the car was shattered and some body damage to the vehicle occurred. In addition, an approximate 5 by 8 foot section of shingles was torn away from the roof of the Dauphin Way Baptist Church, resulting in water damage to the church's interior. |The gustfront and accompanying gustnado then quickly moved east across I-65. A National Weather Service interview with a motorists driving on the I-65 southbound on-ramp indicates that the strong crosswinds hit the vehicle just as it was merging onto the southbound lane of the interstate. The driver reported that his vehicle was spun around twice, ending up facing north in the southbound lanes of I-65. Luckily no oncoming traffic was in the vicinity at the time, and the motorist was not injured and only minimal damage occurred to the vehicle. The driver reported that it was not raining before the gustfront hit, but did rain very heavily just after the event, which is classic evidence of a typical thunderstorm downburst.     |The more significant damage associated with the event then occurred just east of I-65 at the Super Wal-Mart on the I-65 service road. Eyewitness reports and a National Weather Service storm survey indicate that the thunderstorm downburst, still accompanied by the gustnado, reached its peak intensity near the Wal-Mart store. Several sections of roofing material near the back of the store were torn away after high winds, estimated by public reports, observed damage and radar data to have been around 70 mph, blew a large air conditioning unit off the roof. These strong winds were then funneled off the roof of the store and downward into the rear parking lot, where a minivan with several passengers was nearly overturned and sustained window damage, most likely due to flying debris. Five people in the van suffered minor injuries.  As a result of the wind damage to sections of the stores roof, significant water damage then occurred to much of the interior of the store. Some minor wind damage was also noted at the garden section of the store, where light weight roofing materials and numerous other small objects were blown 50 to 100 yards downwind from the store. A large tarp that was hung along a fence was also blown down. The 70 mph estimate is supported by the observed nature of the damage in a localized area and the near complete lack of any other damage in the vicinity. Three people in Wal-Mart were injured. One of the persons who was injured later died from an Aneurysm, but it is unknown if this was a result of the injury.    |No other significant damage was reported anywhere in Mobile county.|<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Erin maintained her depression status as it then began to move northeast into southwest Oklahoma between Hollis and Erick during the afternoon hours of Saturday, August 18th. A very tropical airmass was in place along and east of this feature, extending into western and central Oklahoma. Heavy rainfall developed along and east of the center, which moved slowly to the northeast. Low-level wind shear north and east of Erin increased throughout the evening, with several tornadoes reported in Kiowa, Washita, and Grady counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Damage was reported east of Hobart, and in Washita county south and east of Cordell. As the evening progressed, a strong low-level jet developed, with additional thunderstorms developing over southwest and central Oklahoma. Remarkably, the center of the tropical depression strengthened between 1 and 7 AM, with a compact area of sustained winds of 35 to 45 MPH concentrated around the center of the depression. Wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph were also reported over parts of central Oklahoma at this time. As with the wind speeds, thunderstorms intensities increased, with two additional tornadoes reported over central Oklahoma Sunday morning. In addition to tornadoes and very strong winds, rainfall rates of over three inches per hour were common, with significant flash flooding reported in numerous counties. Rainfall amounts exceeded five inches over a large area, with some locations receiving eight to ten inches. Rivers and creeks easily exceeded their banks, with water also rising quickly in many towns. Dozens of people were rescued by boat and helicopter as numerous homes and businesses quickly took on water. Unfortunately, six people lost their lives due to the flooding. Monetary values were estimated.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Widespread wind damage was reported in and around Geary as strong winds battered the city for several hours. Numerous trees, power poles, and power lines were downed. The Fast Lane Food Mart had its awning ripped off. Numerous signs were blown over. Part of the roof of the nursing home was ripped off.

Numerous trees, large limbs, utility poles and power lines came down during the storm. Reports indicate that many trees fell onto homes, garages and cars throughout the city. One of the houses was damaged enough to be considered destroyed. Between 30 and 35 utility poles had to be replaced because of trees and large limbs falling onto them. One house had three trees fall onto it causing extensive damage. A house in Marion that was being remodeled sustained damage by trees. Three people working on the house quickly took shelter on a porch during the storm, but were injuried when a tree fell onto the roof of the porch and collapsed the roof. A twenty-two year old girl was killed when a large tree limb fell onto the car while she was driving. A passenger in the vehicle survived with injuries. ||Additional support was called in to help clean up in Marion. Electric companies and municipal agencies coordinated to help clean up debris. Estimated costs for clean up in Marion were approximately $91 thousand.  369 loads of debris were cleaned up throughout the city.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The worst flooding occurred along the Raritan and Passaic River Basins. It was the worst flooding in the Raritan Basin since Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Bound Brook and Manville were once again hit hard as were communities on the other side of the Raritan River in Middlesex County. Along the Passaic Basin, Lincoln Park also was hit hard. The nor'easter also brought strong to high winds as well as some snow to the state on the 16th. Numerous streams and rivers flooded, but the flooding along the Delaware River was minimal.  |Statewide damage was estimated at $180 million dollars. It was the second worst rain storm (not related to a hurricane) in the state's history. Acting Governor Richard J. Codey declared a state of emergency on the 16th. About 5,000 people were evacuated in 11 of the state's 21 counties. At one time over 70 major roadways and interstates were closed including New Jersey State Routes 20, 23, 38, 46, 70 and 73 as well as U.S. Route 30 and Interstates 80 and 380. There were over 700 traffic accidents indirectly caused by the flooding and heavy rain. Three people in the state drowned. The strong winds caused about 120,000 homes and businesses in the state to lose power. Power was not completely restored until the 18th. The combination of the snow, wind (power outages) and flooding caused many school districts to either cancel classes or have delayed openings on the 16th. Even Rutgers University was closed on the 16th and 17th. In the Raritan Basin, school closings lasted into the week of April 23rd. The nor'easter was so nasty that even the Internal Revenue Service extended the tax deadline for 48 hours in affected areas. The heavy and flooding rains was expected to delay the spring planting on farms. Garden center and nursery business which was already slow because of the unseasonably cold weather was dealt another set-back. Twelve counties in the state were declared federal disaster areas and included Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris and Somerset Counties.   |Rain began falling throughout the area during the late evening on the 14th. It started briefly as snow over some of the higher terrain of Susse County. The rain fell at its heaviest from about 3 a.m. EDT on the 15th to about 3 a.m. EDT on the 16th. As the upper air disturbance moved across New Jersey, the rain did change to snow for a couple of hours around sunrise on the 16th and accumulated about an inch or two on grassy areas in western New Jersey. The steady precipitation ended during the afternoon and early evening on the 16th. Event precipitation totals averaged 3 to 6 inches. Event snowfall totals were an inch or two in most areas, mainly on grassy areas. |The strongest winds occurred as the nor'easter pulled northeast of the region on the 16th from the early morning into the afternoon. The combination of the heavy rain, even some snow and the winds helped knock down numerous trees and power lines. Peak wind gusts averaged between 40 and 60 mph.|The nor'easter low pressure system initially formed in the southern Rockies on the 12th and moved to Arkansas on the morning of the 14th. At 8 p.m. EDT on the 14th, there were two low pressure systems, one in Kentucky and the other in western Alabama. The southern low pressure system became the predominate one overnight and at 8 a.m. EDT on the 15th, it (996 millibar low) was located in western North Carolina. As the 15th continued, it moved northeast and intensified rapidly. At 2 p.m. EDT the nor'easter (989 millibars) was near Raleigh, North Carolina. At 8 p.m. EDT, the nor'easter was a 979 millibar low pressure system near Virginia Beach, Virginia. Another low pressure system formed on its warm front during the afternoon over Chesapeake Bay and at 8 p.m. EDT it (982 millibars) was over extreme southwest New Jersey. The lows consolidated into one again overnight and a very intense 973 millibar low pressure system was located over Monmouth County, New Jersey at 2 a.m. EDT on the 16th. At 8 a.m. EDT on the 16th the nor'easter was down to 968 millibars and located over New York City. That was a drop in central pressure of 28 millibars in 24 hours which qualified it as a meteorological bomb (a drop in central pressure of at least 24 millibars in 24 hours) low pressure system. The nor'easter bottomed at a pressure of about 966 millibars (28.53 inches) at 11 a.m. EDT just south of Long Island, New York. To put into prospective how low the pressure was with this nor'easter, that central pressure is near the border of the pressure defined category 2 and category 3 hurricane once used on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. As the 16th continued, the nor'easter weakened and meandered across southwest New England and the New York and New Jersey coastal waters. By 2 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the nor'easter's central pressure rose to 988 millibars and a second storm formed on the triple point of its fronts south of Nova Scotia. This became the main low pressure system. The low pressure system then slowly moved southeast over the next couple of days. The heaviest precipitation fell as the low pressure system was rapidly intensifying on the 15th into the early part of the 16th. The strongest winds ceased after the low pressure system started to fill on the afternoon of the 16th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> In Middlesex County, nearly every municipality suffered flood damage or had roads closed due to flooding. Many major roads were flooded including U.S. Routes 1 and 9 and New Jersey State Routes 18 and 27. Nearly 1,000 people were evacuated and 129 homes suffered severe damage.

This intense low in combination with high pressure over eastern Canada produced Overview: An area of low pressure intensified rapidly as it moved slowly from the southeastern United States on the morning of Sunday, April 15th to near New York City by the morning of Monday, April 16th.  The intense low over New York City in combination with high pressure over eastern Canada produced a very intense pressure gradient across the area which caused strong east to northeast winds to develop across the region.  Over land, the strong winds downed numerous trees.  The downed trees caused widespread power outages, especially near the coast, and numerous road closures.  Over the marine areas, the strong winds caused a storm surge and large ocean waves of up to 30 feet to develop.  The combination of astronomical high tides, storm surge, and large waves contributed to coastal flooding in coastal areas of the state and severe coastal erosion in areas south of Portland.|The storm also brought heavy rain to the region which, when combined with snow melt, produced widespread flooding across much of the region.  The flooding of small rivers and streams was worst in southern and coastal areas and led to numerous road closures.   In the mountains, the rain was preceded by heavy snow.  Flooding was minor on most mainstem rivers, however, in southern Maine, the Presumpscot River reached near record levels. |The intense low drifted very slowly eastward from Monday morning through Friday morning as it gradually weakened.  During this time, the pressure gradient slowly relaxed, the winds gradually diminished, and the seas slowly subsided.  However, rain continued into Tuesday across the region and each high tide during the period brought a reoccurrence of coastal flooding and erosion to the area.  Power outages persisted, and stream and river flooding continued across the region during this period.  Many roads remained closed.|On Friday, April 20, high pressure built eastward from the Great Lakes ending the influence of the Atlantic storm.  |  |Wind: The pressure gradient associated with the storm brought high winds to the region.  The damage observed in the hardest hit areas was typical of wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph.  While most observing sites reported winds below this range, topography, elevation, and exposure were likely factors in determining the amount of wind damage any location experienced.  In addition, the heavy rain brought strong wind gusts to the ground level and contributed to the sporadic nature of the heaviest wind damage.  In addition to the meteorological factors, damage from the wind was exacerbated because of the heavy rain that accompanied the wind and the soft, wet ground caused by the spring thaw.|The wind knocked over numerous trees and branches throughout the region and caused numerous and prolonged power outages throughout the region.| |Coastal Flooding/Storm Surge/Waves:  The coastal storm hit during a period of very high (and very low) astronomical tides.  In addition to the astronomical tides, the prolonged period of strong northeast winds caused a prolonged storm surge along the coastline.  Also during this period, the strong winds caused large and battering waves along the coast.  The storm tides and large waves caused significant flooding and coastal erosion. |In Portland, flood level is 12 feet.  During the storm, storm tides reached or exceeded the 12 foot flood level during 7 tidal cycles.  In addition, due to the large waves, coastal erosion occurred throughout the week of April 15th to 20th when the Portland gauge was above or near the 12 foot flood level.  Communication was lost with NOAA���s Portland Weather Buoy shortly after 6 am Monday when it was reporting 31 foot seas.|Precipitation:  Rain developed across the southern part of the state early Sunday afternoon, April 15th and spread northward.  The rain became heavy during the afternoon and overnight.  By Monday morning, 3 to 7 inches of rain had fallen in York County with rainfall amounts decreasing to 1 to 4 inches to the north and east.    In the mountains of Maine, 2 to 7 inches of snow fell by Monday morning.  Although the heaviest precipitation fell from Sunday afternoon into Monday afternoon, precipitation persisted into Tuesday.  Rainfall in Southern Maine was near the 100 year recurrence interval at Sanford and Eliot.|Flooding:  The heavy rain combined with snow melt to cause flooding of small rivers and streams in much of southern and central Maine.   The worst flooding occurred on the smaller rivers in York County.  Damage to infrastructure was severe (roads, bridges, waste water treatment plants, public buildings). Homes and businesses were also damaged. In York County, two people were killed when they attempted to cross a flooded road on foot and were swepted away. The crest on the Presumpscot River was just below the crest recorded during Hurricane Bob in August of 1991.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flooding and damages were countywide.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The entire forecast area experienced heavy rainfall for an extended period of time. As an example of the extreme accumulations, over fourteen inches of rain fell at Lees Camp in the north Coast Range in a period of about 60 hours. This abnormally long period of consistently heavy rainfall led to widespread flooding, with the worst hit areas in the Coast Range and areas draining from the Coast Range to the Pacific Ocean. Five rivers in northwest Oregon surpassed major flood stages, fueling the extensive flood damage across the region.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Nehalem River at Foss reached major flood levels. There was widespread flooding and damage in the city of Nehalem, and a trailer park was evacuated.

The average date for isolated first reports of damaging hail over the past 20 years has been March 24th with the location typically confined to far southeast New Mexico. The March 23rd 2007 episode produced a number of large hail events from Roswell to Tucumcari and peaked with multiple tornadoes from near Tatum north to Clovis and northeast of Tucumcari. A tornado at Clovis resulted in the death of two elderly citizens, the first tornado fatalities in New Mexico since October of 1974. The episode was characterized by a slow moving upper level low that produced strong speed shear but nearly uniform southerly directional flow aloft across the eastern and southeastern sections of the state. Storms with large hail developed first during early and mid afternoon from near Roswell north to Tucumcari. Towards late afternoon and early evening as storms migrated north northeast they encountered an increasing but shallow easterly surface flow that enhanced low level shear resulting in brief but shallow tornadoes. Multiple small but elevated vortices were observed circulating around well defined wall clouds with occasional spin downs into brief tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A small and possibly elevated landspout type tornado developed on the far east end of a rear flank outflow that swung south through east over Logan as a storm centered about 5 miles to the west moved north over Ute Lake. Damage along the track as it moved over the west side of Logan was intermittent with damage indicators pointing to winds of general 80 to 90 mph with peak winds near the south and north ends of the track estimated at 105 mph. Average track width was around 100 yards. Logan had no tornado siren system but citizens reported nearly 30 to 50 minutes notice of an approaching severe thunderstorm. About a dozen injuries were reported with only two transported to Tucumcari for brief treatment in hospital. Heaviest damage was mainly confined to about 50 manufactured homes and recreational vehicles tossed and rolled mainly on the south end of the lake resort community. Damage to site constructed homes and buildings was limited to window, roof and soffit damage except for one 1910 era frame home that lost its roof.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A moist and unstable airmass ahead of the cold front provided the fuel to generate severe thunderstorms that included five tornadoes, near record-size hail and damaging winds.  Thousands of homes sustained damage and about 15,000 customers lost power during the storms, some for almost 3 days as trees blocked roads and slowed repair work to power lines.

The tornado was rated EF2.||A second thunderstorm produced a weak tornado in Wood County, which was rated EF0.  The same storm responsible for this tornado produced softball size hail that damaged thousands of homes, several businesses and hundreds of vehicles.  One hailstone that fell in Port Edwards measured 5.50 inches in diameter, making it the second largest hailstone on record in Wisconsin.||The same supercell thunderstorm that produced the Marathon County tornado also produced a long-track tornado across northeast Shawano, northwest Menominee, southeast Langlade and northern Oconto counties.  This tornado was on the ground for 47 minutes, covering 40.1 miles, and destroyed 14,400 acres of woodlands (timber loss was estimated at $12.5 million) and dozens of buildings along its path.  The twister, which was over one-half mile at times, was rated EF3, with peak winds estimated of 150 to 160 mph.  The storm responsible for the tornado also produced significant straight-line wind damage as it moved into western Marinette County.  ||The fourth tornado of the outbreak, rated EF1, developed near Cedarville in Marinette Co., which was from the same thunderstorm that produced the long-track tornado. ||The final tornado of the afternoon and evening touched down near Harmony in Marinette Co.  This tornado was rated EF1.||Details of the tornadoes, hail, and wind damage can be found in the event narratives of the affected counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The long-track tornado moved from Menominee Co. into Langlade Co. about three miles south of White Lake at 4:48 PM CDT.  Significant damage occurred as the tornado grew to just over one-half mile.  The Bear Paw Outdoor Adventure Resort sustained severe damage with nearly every building (ten) damaged or destroyed, including a three-story inn that was pushed over by the high winds.  Only nine people were on site at the time of the tornado; hundreds were expected the next day for the upcoming weekend.  One employee at the resort was injured, suffering minor cuts to the head.  Hundreds of acres of trees were flattened, and nine homes sustained damage.  The average width of the tornado was 700 yards as it moved across the county.  The tornado was rated EF3 (DI 6, DOD 9; poorly anchored buildings) with winds estimated of 150 to 160 mph.  The tornado exited Langlade Co., around 6 miles east-northeast of White Lake, and moved into Oconto Co. at 4:58 PM CDT.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.20M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado produced sporadic tree damage along Welloo and Welch roads. Moving northeast...the tornado downed additional trees across Caledonia and Iron Mountain roads. The tornado continued in a northeast direction...crossing Hwy 82 and intensified as it crossed Old Strong highway. Here a well build brick home was mostly demolished. The tornado traveled a half mile east and demolished a double wide trailer blowing the debris 150 to 200 yards downstream. Several other homes were affected from this storm before the storm lifted near the community of New London. Five injuries were reported from this tornado with no fatalities.

Severe thunderstorms developed rapidly in the ustable airmass and enough shear was present such that tornadoes developed across portions of southwest Arkansas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A strong tornado developed under a supercell thunderstorm which moved northeast across the county. Damage was largely confined to heavily wooded areas with less than 20 structures sustaining damage. Six of these structures received heavy damage near the community of Strong, Arkansas. Numerous snapped and fallen large trees were also observed.|The extent of the damage ranged from shingles off some homes to others completely demolished. Of the 6 homes that were severly damaged...two were mobile homes. The tornado began in extreme southwest Union County near Junction City where a metal roof was blown off a pharmacy on Route 167. The tornado produced sporadic tree damage along Welloo and Welch roads. Moving northeast...the tornado downed additional trees across Caledonia and Iron Mountain roads. The tornado continued in a northeast direction...crossing Hwy 82 and intensified as it crossed Old Strong highway. Here a well build brick home was mostly demolished. The tornado traveled a half mile east and demolished a double wide trailer blowing the debris 150 to 200 yards downstream. Several other homes were affected from this storm before the storm lifted near the community of New London. Five injuries were reported from this tornado with no fatalities. At the most damaging point of the storm after it crossed Hwy 82...the storm was rated an EF3 on the new enhanced Fujita scale. A monetary damage amount was not available for this publication. |The Damage Indicator for the event was (DI): FR 12 while the Degree of Damage for the event was (DOD): 8.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The atmosphere ahead of the cold front was very warm, moist, and unstable. These conditions combined with the strong storm to produce a late-season and late-night tornado outbreak. Five tornadoes were confirmed in Southeast Michigan in Shiawassee, Genesee, Tuscola, and Huron Counties. Only a couple of minor injuries were reported.

It tracked northeastward and was on the ground for 2 miles before lifting near Main street and Caine Road in Millington. This tornado was rated a strong EF1 with winds estimated around 105 mph. A modular home was completely destroyed, another home received substantial damage after being battered by debris from the destroyed modular home and a framed house lost a section of its roof. Miraculously, a 14-month-old baby, sleeping in a crib in the modular home, received only minor cuts and bruises after being tossed 25 feet and buried under about 4 feet of beams, rafters, and other debris from the demolished home. Total property damages were estimated at $500K. The average path width was 30 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Moving into the eastern portion of South Central Texas, these storms produced heavy rainfall, large hail, and two tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> To the southeast of Hallettsville, and southeast of the first tornado, a second tornado touched down near 0345 CST.  This was just off FM530 on Road 16C, near the community of Light Chapel.  This tornado touched down just south of a mobile home and began moving toward the northeast.  A father, along with two sons and a daughter, had just arrived home less than an hour before the touchdown and had fallen asleep when the storm struck.  The father reported feeling a jolt that awakened him as severe thunderstorm winds ahead of the tornado struck the mobile home.  He reported that it became quiet again and then the mobile home exploded as the tornado stuck.  He and his three children were blown and tossed almost 150 feet, coming to rest on the top of the former south wall of his mobile home.  Broken glass was everywhere, but, in spite of cuts and bruises, they took shelter in a small nearby roofless shack as hail continued to fall.  He then walked, carrying an injured son and daughter, to a neighbor���s house to call for help.  His truck, parked under an awning just south of the mobile home was rolled and crushed.  Had he and his children arrived only a few minutes later at their home, they could easily have been killed.  That all have recovered except for minor bruises and cuts can only be considered a miracle.  The father���s comments were that it���s all okay ��� we���re okay.  What was destroyed is just ���stuff.���  Based on the destroyed mobile home, which had been tied down, and the rolled and twisted metal frame, the tornado was rated EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  Winds were estimated at 115 mph.  The tornado path length was placed at four-tenths of a mile with a path width of 75 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 75.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Moving into the eastern portion of South Central Texas, these storms produced heavy rainfall, large hail, and two tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> To the southeast of Hallettsville, and southeast of the first tornado, a second tornado touched down near 0345 CST.  This was just off FM530 on Road 16C, near the community of Light Chapel.  This tornado touched down just south of a mobile home and began moving toward the northeast.  A father, along with two sons and a daughter, had just arrived home less than an hour before the touchdown and had fallen asleep when the storm struck.  The father reported feeling a jolt that awakened him as severe thunderstorm winds ahead of the tornado struck the mobile home.  He reported that it became quiet again and then the mobile home exploded as the tornado stuck.  He and his three children were blown and tossed almost 150 feet, coming to rest on the top of the former south wall of his mobile home.  Broken glass was everywhere, but, in spite of cuts and bruises, they took shelter in a small nearby roofless shack as hail continued to fall.  He then walked, carrying an injured son and daughter, to a neighbor���s house to call for help.  His truck, parked under an awning just south of the mobile home was rolled and crushed.  Had he and his children arrived only a few minutes later at their home, they could easily have been killed.  That all have recovered except for minor bruises and cuts can only be considered a miracle.  The father���s comments were that it���s all okay ��� we���re okay.  What was destroyed is just ���stuff.���  Based on the destroyed mobile home, which had been tied down, and the rolled and twisted metal frame, the tornado was rated EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  Winds were estimated at 115 mph.  The tornado path length was placed at four-tenths of a mile with a path width of 75 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 75.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The average date for isolated first reports of damaging hail over the past 20 years has been March 24th with the location typically confined to far southeast New Mexico. The March 23rd 2007 episode produced a number of large hail events from Roswell to Tucumcari and peaked with multiple tornadoes from near Tatum north to Clovis and northeast of Tucumcari. A tornado at Clovis resulted in the death of two elderly citizens, the first tornado fatalities in New Mexico since October of 1974. The episode was characterized by a slow moving upper level low that produced strong speed shear but nearly uniform southerly directional flow aloft across the eastern and southeastern sections of the state. Storms with large hail developed first during early and mid afternoon from near Roswell north to Tucumcari. Towards late afternoon and early evening as storms migrated north northeast they encountered an increasing but shallow easterly surface flow that enhanced low level shear resulting in brief but shallow tornadoes. Multiple small but elevated vortices were observed circulating around well defined wall clouds with occasional spin downs into brief tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado that developed in Roosevelt County continued north northwest into Curry County for about 3.5 miles then tracked north northeast an additional 4.6 miles into southern and east central sections of Clovis. Intensity of the tornado appeared to wane from EF2 120 mph in Roosevelt County to EF1 100 mph as it moved north into Curry County along Highway 70 where damage was limited to power lines and farm irrigation equipment. Intensity increased again to EF2 level 125 mph for a segment extending from about 4 miles south of Clovis northward into southeast Clovis which sustained the heaviest and most consistent damage as indicated by structural damage and downed power poles. The tornado appeared to wane again as it move north over Highway 60/84 just east of the intersection with Highway 70. The tornado track became intermittent north of Highway 60/84 with winds likely less than 85 mph before a final one half mile track of heavier damage and EF2 level winds of 120-125 mph. Average width was estimated at 200 yards. About 500 homes and other facilities sustained at least some damage ranging from complete destruction of mobile homes in southeast Clovis and wall collapse at several businesses along Highway 60/84 to the loss of roof shingles and roof top air conditioning units. Thirty five people suffered treatment injuries including five that required hospitalization.

The tornado first touched down in extreme northeast Russell county, Alabama about three miles from the Georgia border, then crossed into extreme southeast Lee county, Alabama, and then entered Georgia as it moved across the north end of Lake Oliver, about 1.5 miles west-southwest of Green Island Hills.  The tornado continued to travel east-northeast across north Muscogee county, including the north suburbs of Columbus (Green Island Hills, Brookstone, Autumn Ridge, Hamilton Station, and Old Moon Road), before finally lifting three miles west of Midland in north central Muscogee county.  The overall tornado path length was approximately 12 miles, with about nine miles of the tornado path within Georgia.  The maximum path width was 300 yards.  The heaviest damage occurred in the 6200 block of Brookstone Boulevard just north of U.S. Highway 80 in the northwest part of Columbus.  Several homes in this area suffered heavy damage and at least one injury was confirmed.  In addition, several commercial buildings on Veterans Parkway sustained substantial structural damage.  Windows were blown out, large air conditioning units were tossed about, large metal business signs were blown down, and power poles were twisted and blown down.  The Hawthorn Suites on North Lake Parkway was destroyed from roof and water damage.  Nearby, the Ramada Inn under construction also suffered considerable damage while a nearby Holiday Inn Express sustained minor damage.  In addition, several churches, including Wynnbrook Baptist, Saint Mark's United Methodist, and Old Moon Road Churches were heavily damaged.  Hundreds of trees were down in the area, a number of which fell on parked cars.

The tornado first touched down in extreme northeast Russell county, Alabama about three miles from the Georgia border, then crossed into extreme southeast Lee county, Alabama, and then entered Georgia as it moved across the north end of Lake Oliver, about 1.5 miles west-southwest of Green Island Hills.  The tornado continued to travel east-northeast across north Muscogee county, including the north suburbs of Columbus (Green Island Hills, Brookstone, Autumn Ridge, Hamilton Station, and Old Moon Road), before finally lifting three miles west of Midland in north central Muscogee county.  The overall tornado path length was approximately 12 miles, with about nine miles of the tornado path within Georgia.  The maximum path width was 300 yards.  The heaviest damage occurred in the 6200 block of Brookstone Boulevard just north of U.S. Highway 80 in the northwest part of Columbus.  Several homes in this area suffered heavy damage and at least one injury was confirmed.  In addition, several commercial buildings on Veterans Parkway sustained substantial structural damage.  Windows were blown out, large air conditioning units were tossed about, large metal business signs were blown down, and power poles were twisted and blown down.  The Hawthorn Suites on North Lake Parkway was destroyed from roof and water damage.  Nearby, the Ramada Inn under construction also suffered considerable damage while a nearby Holiday Inn Express sustained minor damage.  In addition, several churches, including Wynnbrook Baptist, Saint Mark's United Methodist, and Old Moon Road Churches were heavily damaged.  Hundreds of trees were down in the area, a number of which fell on parked cars.  Many power lines were down and thousands were left without power, some for over a day.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 28.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Reports from west of the Rio Grande indicate that a large and devastating tornado stuck Piedras Negras from the west, then dissipated on the west side of the Rio Grande.  The supercell crossed the Rio Grande near 6:00 pm CST and struck the community of Rosita Valley near 6:01pm CST. Severe outflow winds from the storm estimated at between 80 mph and 100 mph struck the community first, causing minor damage to houses and mobile homes. Roofs were partially lifted, exteriors of homes were damaged, and trees were knocked over. Following the wind damage, hail to the size of golfballs struck the area, along with very heavy rain.|Following the winds and hail, the tornado struck next. The team found the tornado touchdown point approximately one-quarter mile to the southwest of the Rosita Valley Elementary School. It struck a four room home��� destroying the outer walls and leaving only the interior walls standing. This damage was rated as EF-2 damage. The tornado then moved toward the east-northeast, directly toward the school. Along its path it damaged three more homes and destroyed a fourth. Damage to the three homes was rated EF-1 with the destroyed home rated EF-2. The tornado next struck a mobile home, tearing off its frame and tossing the debris into the school building. This also indicated EF-2 damage.  Then the tornado crossed Rosita Valley Road, destroying mobile homes and damaging homes and tossing the debris into the south and west sides of the Rosita Valley Elementary School building. The initial strike points at the school showed only minor EF-0 damage. However damage was severe from the center of the school northeastward. It appeared that the tornadic winds were able to open enough of the center part of the roof to enter the interior of the school. These winds as well as winds that entered through wall openings caused severe damage to the north and south wings of the building. This damage indicated wind speeds approaching 140 mph and damage at EF-3 level. To the northwest of the school were two brick retail buildings; both were well-constructed. Outer walls were destroyed in each with damage to interior walls in one of the structures. This also suggested wind speeds near 140 mph and EF-3 level damage.|Finally as the tornado exited the school area it struck an area of single family houses some 200 yards to the northeast. Most of the houses were swept off their foundations and many of them were completely flattened. This damage suggested wind speeds approaching 150 mph, the highest speeds found at Rosita Valley. This was mid-range EF-3 damage.  In conclusion���the tornado was rated EF-3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale with a path width near one-quarter mile and a path length near four miles.  |In all the tornado destroyed one elementary school, along with 59 manufactured homes and 57 houses.  Major damage was reported to 21 manufactured homes and 19 houses with minor damage to10 manufactured homes, 22 houses, and 9 apartments.  There were seven deaths in Rosita Valley as a result of the tornado.  A family of five in one mobile home were killed as it was destroyed and rolled into the Rosita Valley Elementary School.  Two other victims were found, one in a permanent home that had collapsed and one in another mobile home.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 80.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A two block wide swath of damage paralleled U.S. Highway 87 in west Tulia for fifteen blocks. Three persons were treated at area hospitals for injuries, almost thirty homes sustained damage or were destroyed along with twenty businesses, and approximately five hundred people were displaced or made homeless.|Local officials and newspaper accounts indicated that several of the businesses that were heavily damaged during the tornado served as staples to the Tulia economy prior to the storm.

Smaller sections of two additional exterior walls additionally collapsed. |A local auto dealership, located near the supermarket, also sustained a large amount of structural and inventory damage. Forty-one vehicles were damaged by flying debris, and a motor home on the property was overturned. A large overhead door on the east side of the structure's show room failed, resulting in the failure of the west wall. A large storage container was blown into the southwest corner of the building and caused the partial collapse of the roof.|Several large metal industrial-style buildings sustained major damage due to the failure of large overhead doors and buckling of roof purlins on the south side of the buildings.

A broad upper trough over the central U.S. was tracking eastward while a surface low deepened rapidly as it moved from northern Mississippi into eastern Virginia.  A strong low-level jet accompanied the system with 50-60 knot winds observed at 850mb across central and south Georgia late in the day on the 14th.  The low-level jet transported deep Gulf moisture northward into the region. Sunshine during the early part of the day destabilized the region sufficiently to allow for strong to severe supercell thunderstorms to track across central Georgia just south of a warm frontal boundary across north Georgia.  Damage surveys confirmed that nine tornadoes tracked across central Georgia, including many of the same areas that were affected during the major tornado outbreak on March 1st.  The was the second most significant tornado outbreak to impact the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since the August 29, 2005 outbreak associated with Hurricane Katrinia.

The tornado traveled east-northeast across Turkey Creek Church Road, lifting approximately 5.5 miles south-southeast of Dublin near the Oconee River.  The tornado had a path length of approximately six miles and a maximum path width of 200 yards.  Maximum wind speeds were estimated at 120 mph.  Most of the damage caused by the tornado was along Turkey Creek Church Road between U.S. Highway 441 and the Oconee River.  A tied-down double-wide mobile home was completely destroyed along Turkey Creek Church Road resulting in two injuries.  Another tied-down mobile home was destroyed in the same area with two adults and two children inside.  All occupants survived, but one sustained minor injuries.  The carport of a site-built home was removed as well as a portion of the roof.  Several other mobile homes and site-built homes sustained minor damage from wind and fallen trees.  A large greenhouse was also destroyed.  A number of trees and power lines were down all along the path of the tornado.

A 150kt jet was located over the region at 250mb with a strong 50kt low-level jet from central Alabama into central Tennessee.  A wedge of cool air was present over much of north central and northeast Georgia. Rain, which spread over this area early in the day, helped enhance the wedge of cool air.  Little to no severe weather was noted north of the wedge boundary across north Georgia where the air mass remained relatively cool and stable. Meanwhile...a warm, humid air mass was present across much of central and south Georgia where dewpoints had risen well into the 60s during the afternoon.  The strong upper dynamics present over this region combined with the instability just south of the wedge provided a very favorable environment for long lived, strong tornadoes.  A total of 14 tornadoes affecting 17 counties tracked across central and east central Georgia and within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area during the late afternoon and evening hours of March 1st.  This was the second greatest number of tornadoes recorded to have occurred in the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area within a 24-hour period, second only to the 16 tornadoes, affecting 18 counties, associated with Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005.  The March 1st tornadoes spanned an area from Stewart county in the far southwest part of the county warning area to Warren county in the far east central portion of the county warning area.  The first tornado touched down in Stewart county at 4:11 pm EST and the last tornado lifted in Marion county at 10:55 pm EST.  By far the hardest hit county was Sumter county, and especially the city of Americus, where hundreds of homes and business, including the regional hospital, were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Additional tornadoes were reported further south in Tallahassee and Jacksonville's, Florida's forecast areas.  Federal disaster assistance had been approved for 1,836 households across the state for a total of $14.2 million.  Another $5.8 million had been approved for public assistance of debris removal and to repair infrastructure.  The Small Business Association also approved $7 million in disaster assistance loans.  Overall damages, however, are estimated to be several hundred million.|Substantial rainfall fell across much of the state, but rainfall amounts of three to five inches were common across central and east central areas.  The heaviest rainfall fell in the Hancock, Putnam, and Baldwin county areas, where some spots received in excess of six inches of rain.  Some flooding was reported in these areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service in Peachtree City, Georgia concluded that the EF3 tornado that first touched down in southeast Webster county continued to track northeast from the southwest to the northeast corner of Sumter county and then continued into extreme southern Macon county before finally lifting.  The tornado tracked a total distance on the ground of approximately 40 miles.  The tornado entered Sumter county about 4.75 miles southwest of Plains in southwest Sumter county and exited the northeast part of the county about 9 miles north of Methvins in northeast Sumter county.  This was by far the most violent and devastating tornado of the March 1st outbreak.  The tornado tracked roughly 32 miles across Sumter county with a maximum path width of 1.0 mile wide, which occurred in the Americus area.  Damage within the city of Americus was extensive, although structures, trees, and power lines were down along the entire path of the tornado.  The most significant damage in Americus was to the Sumter Regional Hospital, of which a significant portion was destroyed.  Hundreds of homes and businesses in the Americus area were either totally destroyed or sustained significant damage.  Hunderds of vehicles were also damaged or destroyed by debris and/or tossed about like matchsticks.  The majority of the damage was within the vicinity of the Sumter Regional Hospital.  Two deaths were reported at a home in Americus when a wall collapsed on a 43 year-old male and a 53-year old female.  At least eight injuries were documented, but there may have been more.||Within the city of Americus, proper, there were 1235 total structures damaged or destroyed, including 217 businesses, 993 residences, 3 cemeteries, 10 churches, 1 fire station, 1 hospital, 8 recreational facilities/parks, and 2 schools.  There were 75 structures (42 businesses, 31 residences, 1 hospital, 1 church) were destroyed.  There were 148 structures (27 businesses, 116 residences, 3 recreational facilities/parks, 2 churches) with major damage.  There were 331 structures (60 businesses, 260 residences, 3 recreational facilities/parks, 5 churches, 1 school, 2 cemeteries) with moderate damage and 681 structures (88 businesses, 586 residences, 2 recreational facilities/parks, 2 churches, 1 school, 1 cemetery, 1 fire station) with minor damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 110.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A 150kt jet was located over the region at 250mb with a strong 50kt low-level jet from central Alabama into central Tennessee.  A wedge of cool air was present over much of north central and northeast Georgia. Rain, which spread over this area early in the day, helped enhance the wedge of cool air.  Little to no severe weather was noted north of the wedge boundary across north Georgia where the air mass remained relatively cool and stable. Meanwhile...a warm, humid air mass was present across much of central and south Georgia where dewpoints had risen well into the 60s during the afternoon.  The strong upper dynamics present over this region combined with the instability just south of the wedge provided a very favorable environment for long lived, strong tornadoes.  A total of 14 tornadoes affecting 17 counties tracked across central and east central Georgia and within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area during the late afternoon and evening hours of March 1st.  This was the second greatest number of tornadoes recorded to have occurred in the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area within a 24-hour period, second only to the 16 tornadoes, affecting 18 counties, associated with Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005.  The March 1st tornadoes spanned an area from Stewart county in the far southwest part of the county warning area to Warren county in the far east central portion of the county warning area.  The first tornado touched down in Stewart county at 4:11 pm EST and the last tornado lifted in Marion county at 10:55 pm EST.  By far the hardest hit county was Sumter county, and especially the city of Americus, where hundreds of homes and business, including the regional hospital, were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Additional tornadoes were reported further south in Tallahassee and Jacksonville's, Florida's forecast areas.  Federal disaster assistance had been approved for 1,836 households across the state for a total of $14.2 million.  Another $5.8 million had been approved for public assistance of debris removal and to repair infrastructure.  The Small Business Association also approved $7 million in disaster assistance loans.  Overall damages, however, are estimated to be several hundred million.|Substantial rainfall fell across much of the state, but rainfall amounts of three to five inches were common across central and east central areas.  The heaviest rainfall fell in the Hancock, Putnam, and Baldwin county areas, where some spots received in excess of six inches of rain.  Some flooding was reported in these areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service in Peachtree City, Georgia concluded that the EF3 tornado that first touched down in southeast Webster county continued to track northeast from the southwest to the northeast corner of Sumter county and then continued into extreme southern Macon county before finally lifting.  The tornado tracked a total distance on the ground of approximately 40 miles.  The tornado entered Sumter county about 4.75 miles southwest of Plains in southwest Sumter county and exited the northeast part of the county about 9 miles north of Methvins in northeast Sumter county.  This was by far the most violent and devastating tornado of the March 1st outbreak.  The tornado tracked roughly 32 miles across Sumter county with a maximum path width of 1.0 mile wide, which occurred in the Americus area.  Damage within the city of Americus was extensive, although structures, trees, and power lines were down along the entire path of the tornado.  The most significant damage in Americus was to the Sumter Regional Hospital, of which a significant portion was destroyed.  Hundreds of homes and businesses in the Americus area were either totally destroyed or sustained significant damage.  Hunderds of vehicles were also damaged or destroyed by debris and/or tossed about like matchsticks.  The majority of the damage was within the vicinity of the Sumter Regional Hospital.  Two deaths were reported at a home in Americus when a wall collapsed on a 43 year-old male and a 53-year old female.  At least eight injuries were documented, but there may have been more.||Within the city of Americus, proper, there were 1235 total structures damaged or destroyed, including 217 businesses, 993 residences, 3 cemeteries, 10 churches, 1 fire station, 1 hospital, 8 recreational facilities/parks, and 2 schools.  There were 75 structures (42 businesses, 31 residences, 1 hospital, 1 church) were destroyed.  There were 148 structures (27 businesses, 116 residences, 3 recreational facilities/parks, 2 churches) with major damage.  There were 331 structures (60 businesses, 260 residences, 3 recreational facilities/parks, 5 churches, 1 school, 2 cemeteries) with moderate damage and 681 structures (88 businesses, 586 residences, 2 recreational facilities/parks, 2 churches, 1 school, 1 cemetery, 1 fire station) with minor damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 110.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Total damages from the tornado were estimated to exceed $1.2 million, and one person was injured. |The development of this significant tornado was witnessed by storm chasers between Fieldton and Otlon at 17:57 CST. A National Weather Service damage survey team noted that the first damages to occur as a result of the tornado included five medium voltage power poles downed just east of the intersection of Farm to Market Road 168 and County Road 162. Just east of this location, the tops of five power poles were blown off to the north and two center pivot irrigation systems were overturned.

At this location, a historic multi-story house that was originally constructed in 1913 suffered severe roof damage. A portion of the roof was blown off of the structure toward the southeast. The owners of the home were within days of completing a two year-long renovation. In addition, the skirting was removed from a mobile home across the street from the historic home. Several outbuildings near the residence also sustained minor damage.|The tornado continued northeastward and destroyed several more center pivot irrigation systems and snapped utility poles three to five feet above the ground along County Road 321. The tornado's damage path was measured at seven-tenths of a mile wide in this area. |As the tornadic circulation crossed U.S. Highway 70 two miles east of Olton, four homes were heavily damaged.

A broad upper trough over the central U.S. was tracking eastward while a surface low deepened rapidly as it moved from northern Mississippi into eastern Virginia.  A strong low-level jet accompanied the system with 50-60 knot winds observed at 850mb across central and south Georgia late in the day on the 14th.  The low-level jet transported deep Gulf moisture northward into the region. Sunshine during the early part of the day destabilized the region sufficiently to allow for strong to severe supercell thunderstorms to track across central Georgia just south of a warm frontal boundary across north Georgia.  Damage surveys confirmed that nine tornadoes tracked across central Georgia, including many of the same areas that were affected during the major tornado outbreak on March 1st.  The was the second most significant tornado outbreak to impact the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since the August 29, 2005 outbreak associated with Hurricane Katrinia.  The state insurance commissioner reported that at least 81 site-built homes, 28 mobile homes, and 10 businesses were damaged or destroyed during the event.  Damages to structures alone were near $5 million, with additional damages the result of downed trees and power lines.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service in Peachtree City, Georgia confirmed that an EF1 tornado, with a maximum wind speed of 90 mph, had touched down about one mile west of downtown Eastman and traveled north-northeast to a point about four miles north-northeast of downtown Eastman.  The total path length of the tornado was 4.5 miles with a maximum path width of 100 yards.  A number of retail buildings on U.S. Highway 23 sustained minor damage.  However, an adjacent greenhouse was destroyed.  The announcers booth at the Eastman High School football field was destroyed.  Two unsecured mobile homes along the path of the tornado were destroyed.  A man and woman were injured when a home in the the Greenwood Heights Subdivision was destroyed.  Both injuries were the result of fallen and flying debris.  The home was destroyed by a large tree which crashed through the home.  Numerous trees and power lines were downed along the path of the tornado, several of which fell on and caused damage to homes.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 350.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Heavy rains caused flash flooding in the eastern Texas panhandle during the late night and early morning hours. One man was killed by a tornado in the northeastern Texas panhandle and another person was injured.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado developed in southwestern Hemphill County approximately sixteen miles south southwest of Canadian. The tornado moved north northwest at twenty miles an hour and encountered an area of active oil drilling rigs. The tornado hit two drilling rigs. An employee of the first drilling rig that was hit was residing in a single-wide mobile home that was anchored into the ground. The mobile home was destroyed and displaced one hundred yards from its original location and the employee was thrown approximately fifty yards. A semi trailer used for storage was blown over. A structure used to lift the oil-well casing onto the oil derrick was also blown down and severely damaged. The tornado rolled a railroad boxcar one hundred and fifty yards. A series of power poles along County Road W covering a distance of zero point six miles was also blown down.|A second oil drilling rig and production facility were hit by the tornado where another unoccupied and anchored single-wide mobile home was rolled over. Nearby...two goose neck fifth-wheel camper trailers were parked...both unanchored with one occupied. This person was critically injured and later died from his injuries. The camper trailer that was occupied rolled forty-five yards to the northeast while a second unoccupied trailer was blown thirty yards before coming to rest on an oilfield production unit.|By 2041 CST...the tornado was crossing U.S. Highway 60...resulting in severe tree damage. Texas Department of Transportation officials...using light tree damage as an indicator...measured a damage width of zero point eight miles along U.S. Highway 60. At the center of this swath were numerous hardwood trees with trunks that had been broken off halfway up the tree. On the periphery of this area was a home located thirteen miles south southwest of Canadian that suffered only minor damage due to trees falling on the home.

The tornado moved north northwest at twenty miles an hour and encountered an area of active oil drilling rigs. The tornado hit two drilling rigs. An employee of the first drilling rig that was hit was residing in a single-wide mobile home that was anchored into the ground. The mobile home was destroyed and displaced one hundred yards from its original location and the employee was thrown approximately fifty yards. A semi trailer used for storage was blown over. A structure used to lift the oil-well casing onto the oil derrick was also blown down and severely damaged. The tornado rolled a railroad boxcar one hundred and fifty yards. A series of power poles along County Road W covering a distance of zero point six miles was also blown down.|A second oil drilling rig and production facility were hit by the tornado where another unoccupied and anchored single-wide mobile home was rolled over. Nearby...two goose neck fifth-wheel camper trailers were parked...both unanchored with one occupied. This person was critically injured and later died from his injuries. The camper trailer that was occupied rolled forty-five yards to the northeast while a second unoccupied trailer was blown thirty yards before coming to rest on an oilfield production unit.|By 2041 CST...the tornado was crossing U.S. Highway 60...resulting in severe tree damage. Texas Department of Transportation officials...using light tree damage as an indicator...measured a damage width of zero point eight miles along U.S. Highway 60. At the center of this swath were numerous hardwood trees with trunks that had been broken off halfway up the tree. On the periphery of this area was a home located thirteen miles south southwest of Canadian that suffered only minor damage due to trees falling on the home.

A moist and unstable airmass ahead of the cold front provided the fuel to generate severe thunderstorms that included five tornadoes, near record-size hail and damaging winds.  Thousands of homes sustained damage and about 15,000 customers lost power during the storms, some for almost 3 days as trees blocked roads and slowed repair work to power lines.  Four people sustained minor injuries, and total damage from the storms exceeded $60 million.||The first tornado of the outbreak moved across eastern Marathon County shortly after 4:00 PM CDT, producing damage to several homes.  The tornado was rated EF2.||A second thunderstorm produced a weak tornado in Wood County, which was rated EF0.  The same storm responsible for this tornado produced softball size hail that damaged thousands of homes, several businesses and hundreds of vehicles.  One hailstone that fell in Port Edwards measured 5.50 inches in diameter, making it the second largest hailstone on record in Wisconsin.||The same supercell thunderstorm that produced the Marathon County tornado also produced a long-track tornado across northeast Shawano, northwest Menominee, southeast Langlade and northern Oconto counties.  This tornado was on the ground for 47 minutes, covering 40.1 miles, and destroyed 14,400 acres of woodlands (timber loss was estimated at $12.5 million) and dozens of buildings along its path.  The twister, which was over one-half mile at times, was rated EF3, with peak winds estimated of 150 to 160 mph.  The storm responsible for the tornado also produced significant straight-line wind damage as it moved into western Marinette County.  ||The fourth tornado of the outbreak, rated EF1, developed near Cedarville in Marinette Co., which was from the same thunderstorm that produced the long-track tornado. ||The final tornado of the afternoon and evening touched down near Harmony in Marinette Co.  This tornado was rated EF1.||Details of the tornadoes, hail, and wind damage can be found in the event narratives of the affected counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado was the last one of the evening.  The tornado touched down at 6:16 PM about 6 miles southwest of Porterfield, and was on the ground for about 4 minutes, dissipating 2.9 miles south-southwest of Porterfield.  One person was injured by flying debris as they sought refuge in their home.  The tornado flattened a barn (DI 1, DOD 7), tore a significant part of the sheet metal roof from an outbuilding, blew in the garage door and tore part of the roof deck over the garage from a home that was under construction (DI 2, DOD 4), did minor roof damage at a residence, and uprooted large trees.  The tornado was rated EF1 with estimated winds of 90 to 100 mph.  Average path width was 125 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A dry line had become established and was located along the Oklahoma and Texas panhandle border. Also, favorable upper level winds were rotating around the upper level storm system, crossing the dryline over western Oklahoma. As the afternoon progressed, convergence along the dryline became maximized over this area. Thunderstorms developed during the afternoon hours and they quickly became supercells.

Monetary values for the tornado damage were estimated.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the first tornado that occurred in Oklahoma with the southern tornadic supercell.  The tornado appears to have developed 1/2 mile north of E1130 road and along Highway 30 in northern Beckham County, about 2 1/2 miles south of Sweetwater. The first evidence of a tornado was damage to an outbuilding at a gas facility on the west side of the highway along with some tree damage. The tornado moved north along and parallel to Highway 30, damaging trees, homes and some outbuildings. Damage in this area was mainly in the EF0 range. ||The most significant damage occurred when the tornado struck the Sweetwater school. At this location, the tornado is estimated to have been 100-150 yards wide. The most significant damage was to a metal building that was the school\`s multi-purpose building, which was almost completely destroyed. The anchoring that connected the building to the foundation appeared to have failed, allowing all but the most northern section of the building to collapse. A small building that connected this building with the school\`s gymnasium suffered only slight damage. The gymnasium, at the northwest corner of the school, suffered substantial roof damage, which appeared to have caused the west masonry wall of the school to collapse outward. ||Other damage on the school property consisted of a small storage building of similar construction as the multi-purpose building being completely destroyed, a bus barn/garage structure suffering damage when the large garage doors blew inward, and damage to trees, power lines and fences. ||A pick up truck, which had been parked in the school\`s parking lot, was rolled/tossed approximately 100 yards to the north. A horse trailer that had been near the storage building at the southwest edge of the school property was found more than one quarter mile away in a field. ||A man suffered minor injuries near this location.||Just north of the school, a home was damaged and an oil storage facility was also hit. An oil tank from this location was found approximately 500 yards away. ||Several animals were killed when a garage was destroyed. A RV was also destroyed. Numerous cars and school buses were damaged/destroyed. ||The damage to the multi-purpose building at the Sweetwater school is consistent with damage at the low end of the EF-3 scale. The remainder of the damage was primarily in the EF0-EF1 category.||The tornado continued and crossed into Roger Mills County. Monetary damages were estimated. ||<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At 6 pm CST, a surface low was located over southern Manitoba (Canada), just north of Pembina, ND. The cold front stretched to the southwest, back toward Devils Lake (ND) and Bismarck (ND). Ahead of the cold front, temperatures ranged in the low to mid 80s with dew points around 70F. Behind the front, temperatures did not cool significantly, but dew points dropped to the mid 40s. Thunderstorms began to form along and ahead of the cold front by early evening (from northeast ND into south central ND), eventually crossing into northwest Minnesota several hours later. Eight distinct tornadoes occurred over northeast North Dakota and northwest Minnesota during this event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down about 2 miles west-southwest of Northwood. The tornado crossed the Goose River about a mile west-southwest of the Northwood airport and left a 200 yard wide stretch of downed trees in its wake. By the time it hit the airport, the ground track was one-third of a mile wide and growing wider. At this point the tornado was still visible outside the increasingly heavy rain. ||The tornado reached an incredible width of eight-tenths of a mile as it pushed through Northwood to the east-northeast. At this point it had multiple vortices embedded in the overall wedge shaped tornado. The strongest of these vortices appears to have scoured the ground and left broad circulation patterns of debris in the overall damage and debris field. Around this time the tornado likely became wrapped in heavy rain and would have been difficult to observe from a distance. The most extreme damage appeared to be in the northeast corner of the community.||Northwood, in southwest Grand Forks County, had a population of about 1000 people. 90 percent of the roughly 460 homes were damaged. One death occurred in a mobile home, with 18 other injuries reported. The death occurred in a trailer park on the north edge of town, where 19 total units were demolished.||Just to the east of the trailer park, in the area that sustained the extreme damage, three businesses were hit particularly hard. An agricultural company, the towns largest employer, had its buildings heavily damaged. A nearby construction company lost two large steel buildings and other equipment. Steel beams from the two steel buildings were twisted and tossed nearby. Finally, a car dealership lost 15 to 20 vehicles from its parking lot along highway 15. Many of these vehicles were damaged beyond recognition and tossed into nearby fields. One corn field to the north of highway 15 (across from the 3 businesses on the northeast side of town) had it stalks snapped off several inches from the root bases, with pieces of husked corn laying around.||Hangers and airplanes were also damaged at the airport. The local health center, school, supermarket, and grain elevator were damaged. Near the elevator, several rail cars were knocked off the tracks. Hundreds of trees were snapped, uprooted, or damaged. Power was also knocked out to many customers, but eventually was turned off (for safety reasons) to the entire town. A total of about 2600 truckloads of debris were hauled to the town landfill. In the days following the tornado, a Presidential Disaster Declaration was granted.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At 6 pm CST, a surface low was located over southern Manitoba (Canada), just north of Pembina, ND. The cold front stretched to the southwest, back toward Devils Lake (ND) and Bismarck (ND). Ahead of the cold front, temperatures ranged in the low to mid 80s with dew points around 70F. Behind the front, temperatures did not cool significantly, but dew points dropped to the mid 40s. Thunderstorms began to form along and ahead of the cold front by early evening (from northeast ND into south central ND), eventually crossing into northwest Minnesota several hours later. Eight distinct tornadoes occurred over northeast North Dakota and northwest Minnesota during this event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down about 2 miles west-southwest of Northwood. The tornado crossed the Goose River about a mile west-southwest of the Northwood airport and left a 200 yard wide stretch of downed trees in its wake. By the time it hit the airport, the ground track was one-third of a mile wide and growing wider. At this point the tornado was still visible outside the increasingly heavy rain. ||The tornado reached an incredible width of eight-tenths of a mile as it pushed through Northwood to the east-northeast. At this point it had multiple vortices embedded in the overall wedge shaped tornado. The strongest of these vortices appears to have scoured the ground and left broad circulation patterns of debris in the overall damage and debris field. Around this time the tornado likely became wrapped in heavy rain and would have been difficult to observe from a distance. The most extreme damage appeared to be in the northeast corner of the community.||Northwood, in southwest Grand Forks County, had a population of about 1000 people. 90 percent of the roughly 460 homes were damaged. One death occurred in a mobile home, with 18 other injuries reported. The death occurred in a trailer park on the north edge of town, where 19 total units were demolished.||Just to the east of the trailer park, in the area that sustained the extreme damage, three businesses were hit particularly hard. An agricultural company, the towns largest employer, had its buildings heavily damaged. A nearby construction company lost two large steel buildings and other equipment. Steel beams from the two steel buildings were twisted and tossed nearby. Finally, a car dealership lost 15 to 20 vehicles from its parking lot along highway 15. Many of these vehicles were damaged beyond recognition and tossed into nearby fields. One corn field to the north of highway 15 (across from the 3 businesses on the northeast side of town) had it stalks snapped off several inches from the root bases, with pieces of husked corn laying around.||Hangers and airplanes were also damaged at the airport. The local health center, school, supermarket, and grain elevator were damaged. Near the elevator, several rail cars were knocked off the tracks. Hundreds of trees were snapped, uprooted, or damaged. Power was also knocked out to many customers, but eventually was turned off (for safety reasons) to the entire town. A total of about 2600 truckloads of debris were hauled to the town landfill. In the days following the tornado, a Presidential Disaster Declaration was granted.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A couple of homes near Jackson street were heavily damaged and a church on A street had part of its roof taken off.  Four minor injuries also happened in this area.  A daycare center in the church had been alerted to a tornado and had taken cover several minutes before the tornado hit.|After crossing Highway 29 the storm crossed I-110 just north of the pool and started tracking a little more to the north northeast and crossed Davis near the ball fields.

Scattered thunderstorms developed along and ahead of the front late in the afternoon. The storms organized into supercells and short lines during the evening. Over a dozen tornadoes occurred in western Kentucky.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> About a dozen homes were destroyed, and close to 150 others were damaged. An additional 20 public or commercial buildings were destroyed or condemned. Damage to commercial and public buildings, including churches and schools, was estimated near 10.5 million dollars. Residential structures sustained about 1 million dollars in damage. Two historic churches suffered severe damage. The steeple of one church collapsed into the sanctuary. About 125 people were in the church at the time of the collapse, including 25 where the steeple fell into the sanctuary. They all moved to the basement 5 or 10 minutes before the storm hit, sparing anyone from death or serious injury. On the west side of Owensboro, a man was trapped in his overturned mobile home. He received only minor injuries. A motel was heavily damaged, with nearly the entire roof blown off. Several guests at the motel were treated for injuries, mostly abrasions from falling debris. Almost every building at Brescia University was damaged, mostly to the roofs. Windows were blown out of the science building. Elsewhere, a delivery truck was overturned. Piles of debris from collapsed garages, warehouses, and roofs lined downtown streets during the cleanup. Tobacco warehouses downtown were destroyed or heavily damaged. The most serious damage was in a 12 to 15 square block area in and near downtown. Nearly all city streets were reopened and nearly all power was restored within a few days after the tornado. Peak winds were estimated at 155 mph where the EF-3 damage occurred in downtown Owensboro. The damage path began just northeast of the Owensboro-Daviess County Airport, then curved northeast through the riverfront area of downtown Owensboro. The average path width was 300 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 11.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An additional 20 public or commercial buildings were destroyed or condemned. Damage to commercial and public buildings, including churches and schools, was estimated near 10.5 million dollars. Residential structures sustained about 1 million dollars in damage. Two historic churches suffered severe damage. The steeple of one church collapsed into the sanctuary. About 125 people were in the church at the time of the collapse, including 25 where the steeple fell into the sanctuary. They all moved to the basement 5 or 10 minutes before the storm hit, sparing anyone from death or serious injury. On the west side of Owensboro, a man was trapped in his overturned mobile home. He received only minor injuries. A motel was heavily damaged, with nearly the entire roof blown off. Several guests at the motel were treated for injuries, mostly abrasions from falling debris. Almost every building at Brescia University was damaged, mostly to the roofs. Windows were blown out of the science building. Elsewhere, a delivery truck was overturned. Piles of debris from collapsed garages, warehouses, and roofs lined downtown streets during the cleanup. Tobacco warehouses downtown were destroyed or heavily damaged. The most serious damage was in a 12 to 15 square block area in and near downtown. Nearly all city streets were reopened and nearly all power was restored within a few days after the tornado. Peak winds were estimated at 155 mph where the EF-3 damage occurred in downtown Owensboro. The damage path began just northeast of the Owensboro-Daviess County Airport, then curved northeast through the riverfront area of downtown Owensboro. The average path width was 300 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 11.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The day started out cool and rainy, but a dry slot aloft allowed sunshine to break out in the afternoon.  Temperatures rose into the lower to middle 70s in parts of the area.  The warm and humid air was unstable enough to fuel multiple rounds of thunderstorms in the late afternoon and evening hours.  There was a tremendous amount of shear in the atmosphere, and many storms quickly became supercells with rotating updrafts.  This was an environment conducive to tornadoes, as several lines of discrete supercells crossed Northern Lower Michigan.||Northern Lower Michigan had a record six tornadoes on the day.  The previous high was five, set on June 17 1992.  Unfortunately, the Kalkaska tornado produced a fatality.  That was the first tornado fatality in Northern Lower Michigan since March 30 1976, when a single death occurred in Ogemaw County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Kalkaska tornado was the first killer tornado in Northern Lower Michigan in over 30 years.  It touched down just south of Crofton, and tracked north-northeast, lifting just after crossing the Kalkaska County Airport.  A home was damaged in a subdivision just south of Crofton.  The most substantial damage, as well as the fatality, occurred near the intersection of US-131 and Crofton Road.  A large metal warehouse was damaged, a single wide mobile home was destroyed, and several stick-built homes received moderate to severe damage.  The fatality and injury occurred inside the mobile home.  A 29 year old man was pulled from the mobile home, but passed away at a nearby hospital.  Numerous large trees were also uprooted.  The damage became more sporadic to the northeast, until another pocket of concentrated damage at the Kalkaska County Airport.  Several hangars and small planes were damaged, as were several homes in the area.  Sheet metal from one of the hangars was deposited near the Kalkaska Middle School.

The day started out cool and rainy, but a dry slot aloft allowed sunshine to break out in the afternoon.  Temperatures rose into the lower to middle 70s in parts of the area.  The warm and humid air was unstable enough to fuel multiple rounds of thunderstorms in the late afternoon and evening hours.  There was a tremendous amount of shear in the atmosphere, and many storms quickly became supercells with rotating updrafts.  This was an environment conducive to tornadoes, as several lines of discrete supercells crossed Northern Lower Michigan.||Northern Lower Michigan had a record six tornadoes on the day.  The previous high was five, set on June 17 1992.  Unfortunately, the Kalkaska tornado produced a fatality.  That was the first tornado fatality in Northern Lower Michigan since March 30 1976, when a single death occurred in Ogemaw County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Kalkaska tornado was the first killer tornado in Northern Lower Michigan in over 30 years.  It touched down just south of Crofton, and tracked north-northeast, lifting just after crossing the Kalkaska County Airport.  A home was damaged in a subdivision just south of Crofton.  The most substantial damage, as well as the fatality, occurred near the intersection of US-131 and Crofton Road.  A large metal warehouse was damaged, a single wide mobile home was destroyed, and several stick-built homes received moderate to severe damage.  The fatality and injury occurred inside the mobile home.  A 29 year old man was pulled from the mobile home, but passed away at a nearby hospital.  Numerous large trees were also uprooted.  The damage became more sporadic to the northeast, until another pocket of concentrated damage at the Kalkaska County Airport.  Several hangars and small planes were damaged, as were several homes in the area.  Sheet metal from one of the hangars was deposited near the Kalkaska Middle School.  Winds were estimated at 120 mph, making it an EF2.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One long-track tornado cut a path of EF0 to EF2 damage across Livingston, Geneseee, and Oakland Counties. Fenton was the hardest hit area, prompting the Governor of Michigan to declare a state of emergency there. Tornadoes also touched down in eastern Shiawassee County (rated as EF0), northwestern Washtenaw County (rated as EF0), and southwestern Lapeer County (rated as EF1). Thousands of trees were lost to the tornadoes. Although hundreds of homes and buildings were damaged, many destroyed, remarkably only one person was injured (minor cuts from flying glass) and there were no direct fatalities. One man died (indirect) of a heart attack during the cleanup process in Fenton.|In addition to the tornadoes, there were widespread reports of severe thunderstorm wind gusts producing downed trees, limbs, and power lines. The hardest hit areas with respect to severe thunderstorm winds included areas around Flint, Lapeer, St. Clair, Chelsea, Monroe, and many locations in Livingston, Oakland, Macomb, Wayne and Lenawee Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the same tornado that began in Livingston County's Cohoctah Township. The tornado crossed into Genesee County approximately 3 miles west southwest of Fenton at 1649EST. The City of Fenton sustained the greatest amount of damage where the tornado path widened to approximately one-quarter mile, including the snapping and uprooting of hundreds of trees, de-roofing of both residential and municipal structures, and the partial collapse of a large retail structure near the intersection of Owen Road and U.S. 23. Of the approximately 250 homes/buildings damaged in Fenton, two were destroyed and five sustained major damage. The tornado was rated as EF2 in Fenton with wind speeds estimated at approximately 130 MPH. The average path width in Genesee County was 350 yards. One person in Fenton received minor injuries after being struck by flying glass. The tornado exited Genesee County one mile east of Fenton at 1700EST and then continued in Oakland County for another 5.5 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 13.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One long-track tornado cut a path of EF0 to EF2 damage across Livingston, Geneseee, and Oakland Counties. Fenton was the hardest hit area, prompting the Governor of Michigan to declare a state of emergency there. Tornadoes also touched down in eastern Shiawassee County (rated as EF0), northwestern Washtenaw County (rated as EF0), and southwestern Lapeer County (rated as EF1). Thousands of trees were lost to the tornadoes. Although hundreds of homes and buildings were damaged, many destroyed, remarkably only one person was injured (minor cuts from flying glass) and there were no direct fatalities. One man died (indirect) of a heart attack during the cleanup process in Fenton.|In addition to the tornadoes, there were widespread reports of severe thunderstorm wind gusts producing downed trees, limbs, and power lines. The hardest hit areas with respect to severe thunderstorm winds included areas around Flint, Lapeer, St. Clair, Chelsea, Monroe, and many locations in Livingston, Oakland, Macomb, Wayne and Lenawee Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the same tornado that began in Livingston County's Cohoctah Township. The tornado crossed into Genesee County approximately 3 miles west southwest of Fenton at 1649EST. The City of Fenton sustained the greatest amount of damage where the tornado path widened to approximately one-quarter mile, including the snapping and uprooting of hundreds of trees, de-roofing of both residential and municipal structures, and the partial collapse of a large retail structure near the intersection of Owen Road and U.S. 23. Of the approximately 250 homes/buildings damaged in Fenton, two were destroyed and five sustained major damage. The tornado was rated as EF2 in Fenton with wind speeds estimated at approximately 130 MPH. The average path width in Genesee County was 350 yards. One person in Fenton received minor injuries after being struck by flying glass. The tornado exited Genesee County one mile east of Fenton at 1700EST and then continued in Oakland County for another 5.5 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 13.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Near midnight a young woman was driving with three friends and a baby near North Star Mall when she accidentally drove her sport utility vehicle into deeper water where it was slammed against a bridge and then was swept into a drainage ditch.  The three other adults in the vehicle were able to get baby out of the vehicle through the window and escape.  But when the three looked back for the driver, she was gone.

The two boundaries collided near Marble Falls shortly after midnight on June 26 and produced sustained periods of very heavy rainfall across several counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Two lines of thunderstorms, one moving south from the Dallas area and one moving southeast from the Abilene area, intersected and stalled near Marble Falls, producing a sustained heavy rainfall over Burnet County from just before midnight into the early and mid morning hours.  General rainfall over the southern half of Burnet County was between 10 and 15 inches with the highest rain totals in the Marble Falls area, where up to 19 inches fell. The hardest hit area was Marble Falls, where more than 315 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.  The worst of the damage occurred along Whitman Branch Creek.  This included businesses and even a day care facility.  Personnel from Texas Military Forces were mobilized and sent into Marble Falls to help with rescues and evacuations.  The military personnel, along with swift water rescue and other first responders, completed 32 high water rescues and evacuated hundreds of residents.  Shelters were set up at the Marble Falls Middle School.  At least eight bridges in Burnet County were destroyed with some amount of damage to nearly every road and structure in the southern half of the county.  Most roads remained closed all day, but a few were re-opened in the late afternoon.  Cars and vans were strewn all up and down US281 in the Marble Falls area.  Nearly all parks and lakes were closed.  Businesses in Marble Falls were also closed. Drinking water in Marble Falls was contaminated by the flood and over 1000 residents were without water for at least a week. Total estimates of the damages were placed at $130,000,000.  One swift water rescue team member was forced to save himself when his vehicle was washed off SH71 near Double Horn Creek.  He was able to get to dry land after a prolonged struggle.  A couple in Marble Falls awoke to find their home flooded and with the water rising rapidly.  They scrambled to the highest point in the one-story house as the water continued to rise.  Finally, they had to use a shotgun to blast holes in the ceiling so they could break through to climb up on the roof.  They waited with their two dogs on the roof in the dark for 2 hours, then were able to climb down and take shelter in a barn as the water receded slightly.  They waited for an additional 12 hours until they were finally rescued by boat.  Two young men were attempting to drive from a home in Marble Falls to Leander via FM 1431 sometime in the early morning hours of June 27 when their jeep was swept into high water east of Marble Falls. The vehicle was located a few days later in a creek about 10 miles east of Marble Falls.  The body of one of the young men was recovered several days later but the remains of the other young man have not been found.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 137.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Phenomenal rainfall totals occurred during this period, ranging anywhere from 8 inches, to as much as 20 inches, heaviest across southeast Kansas. A few the most extreme and measured rainfall reports from June 28th - 30th were 18.29 inches at Fredonia, 12.47 inches at Independence, 11.70 inches at Iola, 9.18 inches at Chanute, 8.63 inches at Erie and 8.40 inches at Coffeyville. Excessive runoff produced widespread, catastrophic, record flooding across much of southeast Kansas, particularly in the vicinity of area rivers, streams and creeks. Hardest hit were the Verdigris and Fall Rivers, where record flooding was observed at Fall River, Independence and Coffeyville. The Neosho River was also hard hit with record flooding observed at Erie and major flooding observed at Chanute, Parsons and Oswego. Public, private and crop damage was extensive and at times severe. Hundreds to potentially a few thousand homes and businesses sustained severe flood damage, an incalculable number of roads were closed due to high water, and several bridges were either washed out or sustained damage. Thousands of acres of crops sustained severe damage. Thousands of miles of roads were damaged from the flood waters. Evacuations and water rescues were common, as several towns were for a time surrounded and/or engulfed by flood waters. Water became unsafe, as flood waters inundated water and sewage treatment plants. Thousands of residents were without power for an extended period of time. Several counties were declared federal disaster areas. Public and private damages likely exceeded hundreds of millions of dollars, but exact monetary values will be difficult to nearly impossible to determine. The flooding in Coffeyville enveloped the Coffeyville Resources Refinery. A malfunctioning pump lead to a 71,000 gallon crude oil spill into the Verdigris River, leaving an oily gunk on everything the oil touched, and contaminating the water for miles. One fatality occurred in Coffeyville, when a gentleman refused to evacuate his motel room, despite being warned twice by emergency officials of the impending flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Extremely heavy rainfall from the end of June into early July caused flash flooding throughout Montgomery County. The hardest hit areas were Independence and Coffeyville. The flash flooding combined with the ensuing record river flooding along the Verdigris River led to at least 500 homes being destroyed with another 55 sustaining major damages. Businesses in the county reported 23 million in losses and the cost to public infrastructure resulted in another 4 million in damages. Additionally, 43,000 acres of cropland were flooded. The Verdigris River also overtopped a levee protecting the refinery in Coffeyville resulting in an oily toxic mess that inundated areas downstream. The Verdigris River at Independence crested at 52.4 feet in the morning hours of July 1st. This was 22.4 feet above flood stage. At Coffeyville the river crested at 30.7 feet the evening of July 1st which is 12.7 above flood stage. Again, both of these crests were records. The river remained above flood stage for both cities until July 7th. Unfortunately there was one fatality. A 55 year old man was found in the Budget Inn in Coffeyville. An autopsy revealed that the individual died as a result of drowning. This tragedy was compounded by the fact that the individual was warned twice that floodwaters would inundate the hotel but on both occasions the individual refused to leave. The Coffeyville Journal and the Arkansas City Traveler contributed to this report.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 81.15M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Heavy rainfall developed along and east of the center, which moved slowly to the northeast. Low-level wind shear north and east of Erin increased throughout the evening, with several tornadoes reported in Kiowa, Washita, and Grady counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Damage was reported east of Hobart, and in Washita county south and east of Cordell. As the evening progressed, a strong low-level jet developed, with additional thunderstorms developing over southwest and central Oklahoma. Remarkably, the center of the tropical depression strengthened between 1 and 7 AM, with a compact area of sustained winds of 35 to 45 MPH concentrated around the center of the depression. Wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph were also reported over parts of central Oklahoma at this time. As with the wind speeds, thunderstorms intensities increased, with two additional tornadoes reported over central Oklahoma Sunday morning. In addition to tornadoes and very strong winds, rainfall rates of over three inches per hour were common, with significant flash flooding reported in numerous counties. Rainfall amounts exceeded five inches over a large area, with some locations receiving eight to ten inches.

Several cars were stalled due to water over HWY 81 north of Okarche. An elderly couple had to be rescued by an OHP helicopter after their car was washed off US HWY 81. Both sustained minor injuries. A 52-year old man died as he tried to flee his vehicle after it had been washed off of HWY 33 14 miles west of Kingfisher. Several homes and businesses sustained major flood damage, with others faring slightly better. The First Baptist Church had 20,000 gallons of water in the basement, which included the kitchen.

Erin moved onshore near Lamar, TX as a weak tropical storm, but was quickly downgraded to a tropical depression as it moved over land. The tropical depression moved northwest over the Edwards Plateau toward west Texas. Erin maintained her depression status as it then began to move northeast into southwest Oklahoma between Hollis and Erick during the afternoon hours of Saturday, August 18th. A very tropical airmass was in place along and east of this feature, extending into western and central Oklahoma. Heavy rainfall developed along and east of the center, which moved slowly to the northeast. Low-level wind shear north and east of Erin increased throughout the evening, with several tornadoes reported in Kiowa, Washita, and Grady counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Damage was reported east of Hobart, and in Washita county south and east of Cordell. As the evening progressed, a strong low-level jet developed, with additional thunderstorms developing over southwest and central Oklahoma. Remarkably, the center of the tropical depression strengthened between 1 and 7 AM, with a compact area of sustained winds of 35 to 45 MPH concentrated around the center of the depression. Wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph were also reported over parts of central Oklahoma at this time. As with the wind speeds, thunderstorms intensities increased, with two additional tornadoes reported over central Oklahoma Sunday morning. In addition to tornadoes and very strong winds, rainfall rates of over three inches per hour were common, with significant flash flooding reported in numerous counties. Rainfall amounts exceeded five inches over a large area, with some locations receiving eight to ten inches. Rivers and creeks easily exceeded their banks, with water also rising quickly in many towns. Dozens of people were rescued by boat and helicopter as numerous homes and businesses quickly took on water. Unfortunately, six people lost their lives due to the flooding.

Erin moved onshore near Lamar, TX as a weak tropical storm, but was quickly downgraded to a tropical depression as it moved over land. The tropical depression moved northwest over the Edwards Plateau toward west Texas. Erin maintained her depression status as it then began to move northeast into southwest Oklahoma between Hollis and Erick during the afternoon hours of Saturday, August 18th. A very tropical airmass was in place along and east of this feature, extending into western and central Oklahoma. Heavy rainfall developed along and east of the center, which moved slowly to the northeast. Low-level wind shear north and east of Erin increased throughout the evening, with several tornadoes reported in Kiowa, Washita, and Grady counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Damage was reported east of Hobart, and in Washita county south and east of Cordell. As the evening progressed, a strong low-level jet developed, with additional thunderstorms developing over southwest and central Oklahoma. Remarkably, the center of the tropical depression strengthened between 1 and 7 AM, with a compact area of sustained winds of 35 to 45 MPH concentrated around the center of the depression. Wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph were also reported over parts of central Oklahoma at this time. As with the wind speeds, thunderstorms intensities increased, with two additional tornadoes reported over central Oklahoma Sunday morning. In addition to tornadoes and very strong winds, rainfall rates of over three inches per hour were common, with significant flash flooding reported in numerous counties. Rainfall amounts exceeded five inches over a large area, with some locations receiving eight to ten inches. Rivers and creeks easily exceeded their banks, with water also rising quickly in many towns. Dozens of people were rescued by boat and helicopter as numerous homes and businesses quickly took on water. Unfortunately, six people lost their lives due to the flooding. Monetary values were estimated.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A driver had to be rescued due to very high water approximately 1 mile south of HWY 9 on county road 2420. A 0.5 mile section of hwy 9 was also closed near this location.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These storms developed well ahead of a cold front that extended from southern and eastern Oklahoma, into central Arkansas, but mainly along a differential moisture boundary that moved south across east Texas, extreme southern Arkansas, and north Louisiana. Strong surface instability, and gust fronts that developed from these storms, focused new shower and thunderstorm development, with several of these storms becoming severe. One longer lived severe thunderstorm developed over eastern Upshur County, then merged with another southward moving band of strong thunderstorms, producing widespread wind damage across eastern Upshur, much of Gregg, and northern Rusk County. The cities of Longview and Kilgore were hit hardest, with numerous trees blown down/uprooted, power lines downed, and trees falling onto homes, with at least one known injury reported. A 53-yr old man was killed on the north side of Longview when lightning struck a tree he was standing near in wake of the storm.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 53 year old man was struck and killed by lightning on Cox Lane.

The system came through as a bowling ball type event as the upper low first became negatively tilted, then closed off over Iowa.  Low pressure moved across Kansas into northern Missouri, then turned northeast across central into northeast Iowa as it intensified.  The low dropped to about 978 mb as it moved through Iowa.  The low brought a variety of weather to the state, with a blizzard over much of the west half of the state, and thunderstorms with pea to marble size hail over the east half.  As the low passed to the east cold air and high winds overspread the state.  Sustained winds of 30 to 40 MPH were widespread, with occasional gusts to between 50 to 60 MPH were common.  Visibility in rural areas dropped to zero, remaining that way for an extended period of time.  Heavy snowfall occurred over the western part of Iowa with snowfall rates approaching 4 inches per hour at times as the snow was convective in nature.  A large area of Iowa northwest of a a Creston to Mason City line received in excess of 10 inches of snow.  Some of the heavier totals include 18 inches at Estherville, 17 inches at Carroll, 16.8 inches in Estherville, 15.5. inches in Ringsted, and 14 inches in Pocahontas, Atlantic, and Goldfield.  The combination of high winds, heavy snowfall, and the preexisting snow on the ground resulted in roads drifting shut quite rapidly.  Widespread blizzard conditions resulted in numerous road closures over the northwest half of the state.  Interstate 80 was closed westbound at Iowa City to the Nebraska border, and both east and westbound at Des Moines.  Interstate 35 was close both north and southbound at Ankeny to the Minnesota border.  Hundreds of people were stranded in their cars during the height of the blizzard.  The National Guard was called out to conduct numerous SAR missions.  Reports of 5 to 10 foot snow drifts were common across western and northern Iowa, with drifts of 16 feet reported in the Carroll area.  The high winds and wet snow caused additional power outages over parts of the state as well.  An additional 30,000 people lost power during the storm.  Governor Chet Culver declared the remaining 39 counties of the state disaster areas, bringing all 99 counties under disaster declaration.  In addition, a request was made to place 44 Iowa Counties into Federal Disaster Status.  The request was granted, along with two additional counties.  A total of 46 counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration.  The blizzard was considered the worst blizzard in decades for parts of western Iowa.  In Carroll for example, the blizzard was the worst since the blizzard of 1947.  During the storm in Des Moines, thunderstorms moved across the city.  A woman was struck by lightning outside of Lovejoy Elementary School in Des Moines.  She received minor injuries and reported pain in her arm following the strike.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A moist and unstable airmass ahead of the cold front provided the fuel to generate severe thunderstorms that included five tornadoes, near record-size hail and damaging winds.  Thousands of homes sustained damage and about 15,000 customers lost power during the storms, some for almost 3 days as trees blocked roads and slowed repair work to power lines.  Four people sustained minor injuries, and total damage from the storms exceeded $60 million.||The first tornado of the outbreak moved across eastern Marathon County shortly after 4:00 PM CDT, producing damage to several homes.  The tornado was rated EF2.||A second thunderstorm produced a weak tornado in Wood County, which was rated EF0.  The same storm responsible for this tornado produced softball size hail that damaged thousands of homes, several businesses and hundreds of vehicles.  One hailstone that fell in Port Edwards measured 5.50 inches in diameter, making it the second largest hailstone on record in Wisconsin.||The same supercell thunderstorm that produced the Marathon County tornado also produced a long-track tornado across northeast Shawano, northwest Menominee, southeast Langlade and northern Oconto counties.  This tornado was on the ground for 47 minutes, covering 40.1 miles, and destroyed 14,400 acres of woodlands (timber loss was estimated at $12.5 million) and dozens of buildings along its path.  The twister, which was over one-half mile at times, was rated EF3, with peak winds estimated of 150 to 160 mph.  The storm responsible for the tornado also produced significant straight-line wind damage as it moved into western Marinette County.  ||The fourth tornado of the outbreak, rated EF1, developed near Cedarville in Marinette Co., which was from the same thunderstorm that produced the long-track tornado. ||The final tornado of the afternoon and evening touched down near Harmony in Marinette Co.  This tornado was rated EF1.||Details of the tornadoes, hail, and wind damage can be found in the event narratives of the affected counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Hail broke the windshield of a FedEx delivery truck.
