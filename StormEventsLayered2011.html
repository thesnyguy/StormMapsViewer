However, several counties across north Georgia received damaging winds and quarter to half-dollars-sized hail.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Cherokee County Emergency Management Director reported that dozens of trees were down across the county from strong straight-line thunderstorm winds, including areas around Waleska, Ball Ground, Canton, and Woodstock.  A total of 15 homes across the county were damaged from downed trees, including two with major damage and four others with moderate damage.  A middle-aged female was injured at one of the badly damaged homes when a large pine tree fell on her home.  Amateur radio operators reported that the back wall of a building on Cherokee Drive in Ball Ground was blown down.  Widespread power outages were also observed, especially in the Woodstock area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous trees and power lines were blown down across the central portion of the county.

This trough eventually set the stage for the historical and catastrophic tornado outbreak that commenced just two days later on the 27th.  On this day, however, the atmosphere across Georgia, being unseasonably warm and humid, supported widespread development of pulse-type thunderstorms.  Several of these storms became strong to severe and produced large hail and damaging downburst winds.  The most significant damage on the east side of Columbus in Muscogee county where a strong downburst blew down several hundred trees and destroyed two trailer homes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Meteorologists with WRBL and WTVM Television in Columbus reported that a microburst or downburst had caused considerable damage in a small area on the northeast side of Columbus, or approximately one mile northeast of Kenwood.  The worst damage was near the intersection of Macon Road and Crystal Road where the Crystal Valley Mobile Home Park was located.  Other damage was noted from the Willow Bend residential area to Corporate Ridge Industrial Park.  Over 100 large mature trees, many oaks and pines, were either uprooted or split within a two to three square mile-wide area.   Several mobile homes were heavily damaged, including two of which were destroyed when large trees crushed them.  Several fences and metal gates were also destroyed when smashed by the large fallen trees.  WRBL Television reported that two injuries occurred at one of the mobile homes crushed by a large tree.  WTVM also noted wind damage just northeast of Bibb City as well, where a few more large trees were down, one of which crushed a fence.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 350.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Floyd County Emergency Management Director reported that strong thunderstorm winds, likely well in excess of 60 mph, caused widespread and extensive damage across the county.  Some of the worst damage was in the Cave Spring area.  All together, 157 homes and 13 commercial buildings sustained minor to moderate damage or were destroyed, many from downed trees.  Four injuries were reported during this event, three which occurred when a large tree fell on a vehicle and a fourth when a large tree fell on a home and injured an elderly lady.  Over 300 trees were down across the county causing 32 roads to be closed.  Over 15,000 homes and many businesses across the county were left without power for several hours.  Both Shorter University and Berry College were closed as neither institution had any power at the start of the business day.  The Emergency Manager estimated that monetary damages from this countywide thunderstorm wind event exceeded the damage that occurred later in the day with an EF2 tornado, during which the damage was more localized.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system had been slowing moving through the Southern Plains and Midwest in the prior days and had wreaked havoc on that region in the form of many devastating tornadoes, including the EF5 Joplin, Missouri tornado of May 22nd.  As this system spread east, it was weakening in the face of a long standing upper ridge across the southeast U.S. and also moving into a considerably less favorable surface environment.  Nonetheless, it remained a strong upper-level system with decent dynamics.  It brought the most severe weather to the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast office since the historical tornado outbreak of April 27th and 28th.  There were numerous reports of golf ball and larger-sized hail across north Georgia during the afternoon of April 26th which translated mostly into a thunderstorm wind event as the system spread thunderstorm further south across central Georgia during the late evening hours.||Showers and thunderstorms continued during the overnight hours of the 26th and into the early morning hours of the 27th.  By afternoon, the front had pushed into the east central and southeast part of the county warning area.  With afternoon heating and increased instability, thunderstorms increased in intensity and coverage ahead of the front.  Some of these once again became severe.  These were confined to the southeast counties of the county warning area.  Quarter to half-dollar-sized hail was the primary severe weather component of these second round storms.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Fulton County Emergency Management Director and the public reported that at least a dozen trees were down across the north part of the county in the Buckhead and Sandy Springs areas.  A number of roads were blocked from downed trees, especially across the northern part of the county.  Two females in their 60s were killed when a large tree fell on their Mazda Miata sports car while traveling on West Paces Ferry Road at Nancy Creek Road, approximately four miles west-northwest of Buckhead.  A downed tree limb on the MARTA tracks near the Arts Center Station caused delays for southbound trains.  Several power lines were also down across the area with thousands of residents across the county left without power for several hours, many even into the next day.  In addition, a UPS truck was set on fire when a large tree fell on the vehicle.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms developed during the mid afternoon hours due to the building heat and instability and lake breeze convergence.  The first of the thunderstorms developed near Holland around 4 p.m. just a couple miles inland of Lake Michigan where the convergence was the strongest.  Numerous additional thunderstorms developed in the zone of lake breeze convergence.  The storms eventually congealed into a line of storms which marched eastward across the area during the early to mid evening hours.  ||The storms produced winds of up to around 60 mph in some localized locations.  A gust to near 50 mph at the Gerald R Ford Airport in Grand Rapids produced damage to a couple of hangars that injured four people who were in the hangars at the time.  The storms also produced some hail, with the biggest hail stones measuring over two inches in diameter in Muskegon and just east of Bangor.  ||The most significant issue with the storms however was heavy rainfall.  A storm that produced very heavy rainfall and did not move very fast in eastern Ottawa county from Allendale to near Marne produced 3 to locally 5 inches of rain within a two hour time frame.  This created flooding on parts of the campus of Grand Valley State University, and produced standing water on the roads in Allendale and Tallmadge township in Ottawa county.  Some other areas that received the highest rainfall totals were near the intersection of Isabella, Montcalm and Gratiot counties.  Western Calhoun county also received significant rainfall and portions of the aforementioned areas saw up to 5 inches of rain falling in a 2 to 3 hour time frame.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Thunderstorm wind gusts caused two civilian hangars to become damaged and collapse at the Gerald R. Ford International Airport, causing four injuries.  Three of the four were treated on the scene and released but one person who incurred more significant injuries and a head laceration was taken to the hospital.   The damage occurred at the north end of the airport and affected a row of general aviation hangers.  The injuries occurred due to debris from the two hangars that collapsed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Moderate wind shear with 0-6km shear values of 35 to 45 knots and mixed layer (ML) CAPE in the 1500 to 2500J/kg range in place over the region combined with enhanced lift from an upper disturbance rotating through the base of an approaching upper trough to produce strong to severe supercell thunderstorms during the afternoon into the evening of June 21st.

The severe thunderstorms also produced large hail and damaging wind gusts, including a 2-mile wide microburst across sections of Waukesha County that damaged homes, barns and felled thousands of trees and numerous power lines. In addition, the thunderstorms fed off a moisture-rich air mass moving into the region, with precipitable water values around 1.8 inch, that also produced heavy rainfall and flash flooding in portions of Waukesha and Milwaukee counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 2-mile wide swath of damage was caused by a microburst associated with a bowing line of severe thunderstorms that tracked from southwest to northeast across a large portion of Waukesha County.

A favorable setup for severe thunderstorm activity, developed in the mid-section of the country. Very warm and humid air lifted northward into the region, while cooler air lingered in the western Great Lakes. The battleground between these two types of air mass, established itself from Nebraska to western Iowa, northern Kansas, and northern Missouri.||Severe thunderstorms developed during the evening and overnight hours of Thursday August 18th and 19th, 2011.  Scattered supercell thunderstorms developed over eastern Nebraska and western Iowa, producing very large hail and heavy rain. While this soon to be large cluster of thunderstorms was beginning to develop over western Nebraska, an isolated supercell drifted towards the city of Maryville, Missouri.  As this storm rolled through the city,  winds greater than 80 mph even approaching 100 mph created extreme damage. This storm crushed numerous corn fields and produced extensive hail damage. Quickly filling in behind this supercell was the aforementioned developing mesoscale convective system, or MCS, capable of producing extreme winds. This system quickly became organized and pushed from north to south down the Missouri river. Winds were estimated between 60 and 80 mph, as damage was reported from St. Joseph to Leavenworth, and across the Kansas City metropolitan area. Extensive tree and powerline damage was reported, with upwards of 100,000 customers without power, at the height of the event.  This storm system, even knocked down the primary radio tower, for the Missouri State Patrol in St. Joseph, Missouri.||This thunderstorm complex continued to push south and east, finally reaching the Missouri State Fair around 1 am Friday morning. Measured winds of 62 mph caused havoc at the fairgrounds, blowing over tents and leading to the evacuation of the nearby campers and campgrounds. Damage cleanup at the fairgrounds, caused the fair to open up their gates, well into the daytime hours of Friday.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A gas station awning was blown down.

The peak wind gusts included 45 knots (52 mph) at Brandywine Shoal Light, 43 knots (50 mph) at Lewes in Sussex County and 42 knots (48 mph) at Ship John Shoal Light.  | |The gale force winds were caused by the pressure difference between the intensifying low pressure system to the south and east of Delaware and a high pressure system over New England. Once the low pressure system passed far enough east of Delaware during the evening of the 29th, the gale force wind gusts started to subside and ended overnight.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The strong winds caused high waves of 12 to 16 feet.  The strong winds and high waves caused extensive damage to boats in the South Shore Yacht Club, mainly due to an eroding and failing breakwall protecting the southern part of Milwaukee Harbor.  Three boats were totally destroyed at the yacht club.  Four others were washed ashore and were able to be salvaged.  Two of the destroyed boats were sunk.

Several locations in the Susquehanna Basin came close to records set by Hurricane Agnes (June 1972) and a few points (Bloomsburg, Hershey and Loyalsockville) set new floods of record. Flooding along Swatara Creek resulted in property damage and several deaths. Severe flooding occurred along Loyalsock Creek and many points along the main-stem of the Susquehanna River. The interaction of a stalled frontal boundary over the Mid-Atlantic region, a strong northern stream short-wave (with a persistent jet entrance region) and deep tropical moisture associated the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee resulted in multi-day, significant heavy rainfall event over Pennsylvania. ||Tropical storm Lee was the twelfth named storm of the 2011 season forming over the Gulf of Mexico on September 1. A strong northern stream short-wave interacted with Lee causing the storm to re-curve to the north-northeast. By 1200 UTC September 6, having undergone extra-tropical transition, post-tropical Lee was located over northern Georgia. The surface low weakened as it moved up the Appalachian Mountain chain. However, the strong low-level flow and the above normal precipitable water produced an extensive, north-to-south oriented band of heavy rainfall.||The rainfall associated with the remnants of Lee produced the 4th largest flood of record in the Mid-Atlantic Region. The five-day storm rainfall totals for September 5 to 9 were generally in the 5-8 inch range over the mid-section of central Pennsylvania and in the 8-12 inch range in the Susquehanna Valley region. There were local amounts reported in excess of 15 inches east of the Susquehanna River. The local climate sites in Harrisburg (KMDT) and Williamsport (KIPT) reported 13.44 and 9.03 inches respectively. On September 7, 2011 both KMDT and KIPT set their all-time daily (24-hour) rainfall for the month of September at 7.71 and 6.76 inches respectively. These sites later went on to break the all-time monthly (September) and annual precipitation records, making 2011 the wettest year on record.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Swatara Creek near Hershey crested at major flood stage, 26.8 feet.  Flood stage is 7.0 feet. Swatara Creek at Middletwon crested at major flood stage, estimated at 26.30 feet.  Flood stage is 11.0 feet.  This is the 5th highest all time.||The Susquehanna River at Harrisburg crested in major flood stage at 25.17 feet.  Flood stage is 17 feet.  This is the 5th highest crest on record.||While the Susquehanna River flooded a large area of Harrisburg, some areas were fortunate enough to escape the flood waters.  Midtown and Uptown residents were largely unscathed, though widespread power outages were reported.  The river levels crested several feet below that of Agnes, thanks in part to less contribution from the West Branch of the Susquehanna.||Between 8,000 and 10,000 residents were evacuated.  The Shipoke area of downtown reported significant flooding. City Island was also hard hit, with the baseball stadium under at least seven feet of water, prompting the double A baseball team to have to play its playoff games on the road.||Major damage was widespread in Hershey.  Hersheypark and ZooAmerica both reported major damage with 8 feet of water in low lying areas of Hershey Park.  Many structures were flooded and many roads suffered damage.  A ramp off of Route 322 near the Penn State Hershey Medical Center had a 3-foot deep trench cut across the road.  Swatara Creek cut a wide and devastating flood path.  Evacuations were noted in Palmyra, Derry Township and Middletown.||A 70-year old man died when a basement wall collapsed on him in Derry Township. He was pumping water from his flooded basement. A second man died in flood waters. While details surrounding his death are unknown, his mud covered car and body were found in Swatara Township several days after the flooding. A third man, 81 years old, drowned after his car was washed into Clarks Creek in Middle Paxton Township. Finally, a fourth victim, a 54 year old female, was swept away by flood waters. Her body was recovered weeks later in Swatara Creek.||Water rescues were widespread in Dauphin County.  One county rescuer was quoted, ���We were rescuing people on the way to rescuing people,��� Leonard said. ���There was no time for introductions or salutations. We were dispatched every 90 seconds for hours.���||Severe flooding occurred on Spring Creek.  House flooding, closed roads and water rescues using boats were conducted in Paxtang Borough and Swatara Township.  Three-quarters of all roads were flooded in Derry Township. Middletown on the mouth of Swatara Creek, where it enters the Susquehanna River also reported major flooding.  Five of the eighteen homes on Few Avenue were condemned from flood damage.  The basements of these homes were visible from the street through giant holes in the foundation.  Residents also reported a foul smell after the floods, with one resident saying, ���Imagine the contents of a septic tank mixed with diesel and fuel oil.���||A preliminary total of 295 buildings were destroyed, 1040 suffered major damage, and 1273 suffered minor damage with a total of 3348 structures impacted. Overall damage was estimated at $150 million.  In addition, 368 acres of crops were destroyed with an estimated value of $700,000.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid.

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.||Irene helped make August 2011 the wettest August on record for the state of New Jersey dating back to 1895. A new August monthly rainfall record of 16.10 inches was established in Trenton.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> In Pilesgrove Township, a 20-year-old woman was swept away by flood waters near the Salem River on U.S. Route 40 and drowned while driving her car early on the 28th. The combination of flooding rains and tropical storm force wind gusts closed forty roadways in the county. The collapse of the East Lake Road Dam in Woodstown flooded sections of the borough and Pilesgrove Township. In Pittsgrove Township, both Centerton and Palantine Lakes flooded. Half of Parvin State Park suffered wind and flood damage.  ||For the second time within the month, the Maurice River at Norma had major flooding and set the second highest crest on record.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th.

Irene is expected to be the costliest natural disaster in the history of New Jersey. Approximately one million people were evacuated from the coast and low lying areas prone to inland flooding throughout the state of New Jersey including all of Cape May County. Irene also caused record breaking outages to utility customers as around one and a half million people lost power throughout the state. Power was not fully restored until September 5th. The widespread flooding resulted in the second highest crest (highest was with Hurricane Floyd in September 1999) on record for the Raritan Basin, but the highest crest on record for many other river basins including the Passaic. Moderate tidal flooding occurred along the tidal Delaware River and Delaware Bay and minor to moderate flooding occurred farther north along the Delaware River. Moderate to severe tidal flooding occurred along the Atlantic Coast and Raritan Bay There were six direct deaths associated with Irene, all drownings. The deaths occurred in Salem County, Mercer County (two), Ocean County (two) and Morris County. Preliminary damage estimates in the whole state of New Jersey were near one billion dollars to approximately 200,000 homes and businesses. The closure of the Atlantic City casinos (only the third time in history) for three days caused an estimated 45 million dollars in lost revenue.   The combination of wind and flooding forced the closure of about 350 main roadways in the state including sections of Interstate 287, the Garden State Parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. The flooding rains and winds damaged the corn, peach, pumpkin, tomato,  pepper, cucumber, potato and squash crops and feared will damage the blueberry crop in 2012. Drug industry production fell the week of August 29th because of traveling problems. Free ice and water were distributed in locations with widespread power outages. The American Red Cross distributed over 1,000 clean-up kits and 100,000 meals and snacks.   ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread New Jersey during the late afternoon and evening of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph inland and around 65 mph at the coast. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the inland peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread New Jersey during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 10 inches and caused widespread record breaking flooding. Many locations broke August's all time monthly rainfall records even before Irene arrived. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related Stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate to severe tidal flooding along the ocean side and moderate tidal flooding in Delaware Bay and tidal sections of the Delaware River. The tidal flooding was during the evening and overnight high tide on the 27th across southern New Jersey, Delaware Bay and the Delaware River, but with the morning high on the 28th in Northern New Jersey. The morning high tide coincided closer with the high tide cycle and caused most of the severe tidal flooding to occur there.  Minor tidal flooding persisted in tidal sections of the Delaware River during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. ||Governor Chris Christie declared a state of emergency on August 25th. New Jersey Transit rail, bus and light rail operations were suspended on the weekend of the 27th and 28th. Full transit service was not restored until Wednesday August 31st.  In Cape May County, countywide mandatory evacuations were ordered on August 25th, and for residents the next day. Traffic on New Jersey State Route 55 south of Vineland, New Jersey Route 47 and New Jersey Route 347 were only allowed to head north leaving Cape May County.||All Atlantic County shore communities east of U.S. Route 9 including Atlantic City were placed under a voluntary evacuation at 8 p.m. August 25th and the following day a mandatory evacuation effective starting 6 a.m. EDT. All Atlantic City casinos were shut down as the city faced the first mandatory evacuation in history. About 1,500 National Guard troops had been deployed in the state to help with evacuations.  In Ocean County, all of the barrier islands including Long Beach Island were under mandatory evacuation starting at 8 a.m. EDT on August 26th.  To relieve evacuation traffic, toll operations were temporarily suspended on the Garden State Parkway south of the Raritan River and on the Atlantic City Expressway. The southbound lanes on the Garden State Parkway south of exit 98 were closed at 8 p.m. EDT on August 26th, while eastbound traffic was stopped on New Jersey State Routes 70 and Route 72.||Major flooding occurred on the Raritan, Millstone, Rockaway and Passaic Rivers.  Record flows were reported at the Musconetcong River in Warren County as well as the Assunpink Creek in Mercer County and the Rancocas Creek in Burlington County. Flooding on the rivers lasted as long as September 5th. The flooding affected and closed   numerous roads, including the heavily used Interstate 287 in Boonton when the northbound shoulder collapsed from the force of the Rockaway River. The Garden State Parkway flooded in Toms River near exit 98. On Monday August 29th, eighty roadways were still closed and thirty-six roadways were still closed on the 30th.  Ninety-eight percent of the closed roadways were reopened as of September 1st.  Coupled with a reduced transit schedule, travel was described as gridlock on the 29th   Thousands of homes were also flooded, especially in Morris and Somerset Counties. Many northern New Jersey schools that were scheduled to open on the 29th were closed. ||At the Trenton Train Station along Assunpink Creek, flooding impacted Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, SEPTA's Trenton Line, and New Jersey Transit's (NJT) Northeast Corridor Rail Line. Service was not fully restored to and through Trenton until August 31st. Irene cost NJT just under $10 million in lost revenue and damaged infrastructure. Numerous homes suffered structural damages from the winds, and limbs impacting their roofs. ||In total, approximately 1.6 million customers of JCP&L and PSE&G throughout the state lost power. Two days after the storm, 500,000 PSE&G customers were still without power, down from a peak of about 928,000. By September 3 power had been restored to all but 750, but thousands of JCP&L customers were still without service. On September 2nd, 37,000 JCP&L customers were awaiting restoration of service. On Sunday September 5, power had been returned to last remaining 2,000 residents who suffered a power outage. ||There was one confirmed tornado in Mercer County, but widespread tree wind damage (and damage to homes and vehicles when trees fell on them) occurred in every county.  In addition, a few municipalities experienced stronger wind bursts that caused direct property damage. The strong winds forced the suspension of service on the Cape May Lewes Ferry.  In Monmouth County, in Long Branch, the high winds damaged two roofs of an apartment complex on Ocean Boulevard.  In Ocean County, an estimated 500 trees were knocked down.  The SpongeBob ride at the Funtown Pier in Seaside Park was damaged. In Atlantic County, a piece of an exterior wall of the Borgota Hotel was blown off.  In Gloucester County, a 61-year-old woman suffered a head injury after being struck by a tree. ||The shore took a pounding from the coastal flooding and heavy surf. A 25-year-old and a 24-year-old man drowned in Point Pleasant (Ocean County) after going to the shore to view the storm. The average sand loss was about four to five feet high and one hundred fifty feet wide.  Waves were estimated to reach as high as 12 feet as offshore seas reached 25 feet. There were numerous reports of dune fence damage and sand overwashes onto streets and boardwalks. Along the Raritan Bay side of Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, most of the vertical cuts were less than two feet and no breaches were reported. In Keansburg and Union Beach in Monmouth County low lying bayshore communities experienced tidal flooding. About 3,000 county residents were evacuated along Raritan Bay. Along the Atlantic Ocean side of Monmouth County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 5 feet. In Spring Lake, about one and a half miles of the borough���s boardwalk was damaged and closed. In Ocean County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet north of Barnegat Light and 4 to 6 feet south of Barnegat Light. A dune cut was reported in Harvey Cedars. Dune washovers occurred in Brant Beach. In Beach Haven, dune cuts reached 10 feet and the geotubes at Merrivale Avenue were overtopped. No flood damage to homes was reported. The entrance to the Holgate Natural Area was impassable as stone and rubble were exposed. In Atlantic County, vertical cuts averaged 1 to 4 feet, but reached 6 feet in Brigantine. In Cape May County, vertical cuts averaged 2 to 4 feet. A couple of horizontal dune cuts occurred in North Wildwood and the top cap of a timber bulkhead was knocked off. In Cape May City, a horizontal dune cut occurred on Poverty Beach. | |President Barack Obama initially declared the state a disaster area, making residents of Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset Counties and made them eligible for federal aid. The declaration was later extended throughout the state.||The highest wind gusts recorded during Hurricane Irene were 75 mph at Cape May Ferry Terminal (Cape May County), 69 mph in Harvey Cedars (Ocean County), 69 mph in Tuckerton (Ocean County), 68 mph in Cape May Harbor (Cape May County), 66 mph at the Atlantic City Marina (Atlantic County), 66 mph in Ocean City (Cape May County), 65 mph in Point Pleasant (Ocean County), 58 mph in Atlantic City (Atlantic County), 58 mph in Sandy Hook (Monmouth County), 58 mph in Brick (Ocean County), 57 mph in Keansburg (Monmouth County), 55 mph in Barnegat Light (Ocean County), 55 mph at Lakehurst NAS (Ocean County), 55 mph at Point Point (Atlantic County), 55 mph in Seaside Heights (Ocean County), 53 mph at Wildwood (Cape May County), 52 mph in Belmar (Monmouth County), 52 mph in Bivalve (Cumberland County), 52 mph in Trenton (Mercer County), 51 mph at Ft Dix-Wrightstown (Burlington County), 50 mph in Wantage (Sussex County), 47 mph in Mount Holly (Burlington County) and 42 mph in Somerville (Somerset County).||Peak storm tides included 9.75 feet above mean lower low water in Sandy Hook (Monmouth County).

It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th as a category one and then proceeded to the northnortheast. Irene went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene continued to slowly weaken and made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.||Irene helped make August 2011 the wettest August on record for the state of New Jersey dating back to 1895. A new August monthly rainfall record of 16.10 inches was established in Trenton.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Morris County was greatly effected by flooding from Irene, especially along the Passaic and Pompton Rivers. |In Dover Township, a construction worker fell off a bridge, was washed away and drowned in the Rockaway River. About 4,000 homes in the county were affected by flood waters in Pequannock, Lincoln Park, Dover, Parsippany and Denville. The flooding along the Rockaway River forced the collapse of the northbound Interstate 287 roadway shoulder in Boonton. All northbound lanes remained closed until August 30th. In Hanover Township, a 177-yearold historic First Presbyterian Church of Whippany suffered approximately about $350,000 in damages, one of the hardest hit structures in the county.||Full scale evacuations occurred in Pequannock Township and Lincoln Park Borough.

Moderate stream and river flooding occurred in the Poconos and Lehigh Valley and moderate to major river flooding occurred in southeast Pennsylvania. For many places in southeastern Pennsylvania, it was the worst creek and river flooding since Hurricane Floyd in 1999 or the remnants of Hurricane Jeanne in 2004. Flooding along non-tidal sections of the Delaware River was minor to moderate. There were two direct storm caused deaths: a wind related death in Monroe County and a drowning in Montgomery County.  About 500,000 PECO Energy and 420,000 Pennsylvania Power and Light customers lost power in Eastern Pennsylvania. For both utilities this ranked within the top five outages of all time.  Preliminary damage estimates were around six million dollars. In addition to property damage, the winds and rains badly damaged the corn crop in southeastern Pennsylvania. The Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area was closed through Labor Day Weekend (September 5th). ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread Eastern Pennsylvania during the evening of the 27th and persisted into the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 50 mph. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th and early morning of the 28th. The second peak occurred during the afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. Most of the peak wind gusts occurred at this time. The rain associated with Irene overspread Eastern Pennsylvania during the late morning on the 27th, fell at its heaviest from during the evening of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended during the early afternoon on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 3 to 7 inches and caused widespread flooding. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all flooding related stormdata county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 5 feet caused moderate tidal flooding along tidal sections of the Delaware River overnight on the 27th. Minor tidal flooding occurred during the high tide cycles from the 29th through the 31st. | |In Stroudsburg (Monroe County), a 44-year-old man died when a tree fell on him in his backyard. He pushed his son to safety. Governor Tom Corbett declared a state of emergency for the city of Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs. The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority halted all commuter rail service during the evening of the 27th as multiple tornado warnings were issued.  Three large shelters on the evening of August 27th in Philadelphia. The Philadelphia International Airport closed at 1030 p.m. EDT on the 27th and reopened on Monday the 29th. In Philadelphia, the storm left thousands without power. More than 500 trees fell in the city, seven buildings collapsed and twenty roads were closed. PECO Energy restored power by August 31st.||The highest wind gusts recorded during Irene were 57 mph in Mount Pocono (Monroe County), 53 mph in Allentown (Lehigh County), 52 mph at the Philadelphia International Airport (Philadelphia County), 48 mph in Reading (Berks County), 46 mph in Coatesville (Chester County), 45 mph in Northeast Philadelphia (Philadelphia County), 44 mph in Pottstown (Montgomery County), 44 mph in Newbold (Bucks County) and 40 mph in Quakertown (Bucks County). The high tide in Philadelphia reached 9.89 feet above mean lower low water during the early morning of the 28th. Moderate tidal flooding begins at 9.20 feet above mean lower low water. ||Hurricane Irene formed east of the Leeward Islands on Saturday the 20th. It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th and then proceeded to the northnortheast and went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. From there Irene paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.||Irene helped shatter all time monthly precipitation records. In Philadelphia, the 19.31 inches of rain established a new all-time August as well as monthly record. It was nearly half of the normal yearly precipitation total. A new August as well as all-time monthly rainfall record of 13.47 inches was also established in Allentown.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 65-year-old woman on her way to work drowned in her car in the Wissahickon Creek in Fort Washington.

There were numerous closed roads across the region, leading to often lengthy detours. Because of the high water, there were numerous day and nighttime restrictions to barge traffic. Hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland were flooded. Crops were late getting planted.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Record flooding occurred on the Big Muddy River. At the Plumfield river gage, the river crested at 34.68 feet on the evening of May 3. This exceeded the old record set in 1961 by less than an inch. Illinois Route 148 was closed south of Zeigler, as was County Highway 11. A section of Illinois Route 149 was closed, along with Illinois Route 37 north of West Frankfort. About two dozen homes were flooded, mostly in the Mitchell Lake area of Denning Township. Between five and six feet of water entered some homes. A 62-year-old man was found clinging to a tree after ignoring barricades and driving into swift water on the morning of May 3. The man was treated for hypothermia at a local hospital. His vehicle was washed off the roadway into deep water.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The flooding was considered moderate. The flooding was due to a prolonged active weather pattern that carried over from February. From February 23 through March 14, a total of 8.31 inches fell at Evansville, IN and 9.43 inches at Paducah, KY. Isolated evacuations of some lowland residents were conducted. In Crittenden County, the community of Tolu was threatened. In Livingston County, homes were threatened in Birdsville, and a few homes were surrounded by water in Ledbetter. Just west of Paducah, a 90-year-old man drowned (direct fatality) after he drove around barricades down a flooded secondary road. This incident occurred during the early afternoon hours of March 20, around 1 to 2 P.M. The victim could not see the edge of the road and ended up submerged in 12 feet of water in a ditch. Several people who tried to rescue the victim were taken to a local hospital for treatment of hypothermia. In western McCracken County, several homes were threatened, and they were protected with sandbags. All along the Ohio River, a number of roadways were closed. Most of the closed roads across the region were rural county and state roads. There was considerable flooding of low-lying fields and woodlands near the river. Riverside parks and recreation areas were flooded. Very few residences were flooded. The crest at the Paducah river gage was 47.81 feet, which was nearly identical to the January, 2005 flood and almost four feet lower than the 1997 flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Irene moved through the Caribbean and up the east coast of the United States making landfall twice. She first made landfall as a Category 1 Hurricane near Cape Lookout, North Carolina around 7:30am on August 27, then moved offshore again during the evening. She then made a 2nd landfall, again as a Category 1 Hurricane at 540am on August 28 near Little Egg Inlet in New Jersey. She moved over New York City and then into southeastern New York State and Connecticut as a Tropical Storm a few hours later. By the end of the evening of the 28th, Irene was crossing the U.S./Canada border having produced significant amounts of rain, storm surge, inland and coastal flooding, and wind damage across southern New England and much of the east coast of the United States. ||In Southern New England, the minimum surface pressure recorded was 976.9mb taken at Barnes Municipal Airport in Westfield, Massachusetts. The storm surge experienced along the coast was generally in the two to four foot range with a high of 4.78 feet at Fox Point in Providence, Rhode Island. The highest sustained windspeed was 54 knots (62 mph) at the Physical Oceanographic Real Time System station at Conimicut Light in Narragansett Bay, RI. The highest sustained wind speed on land was 38 knots (44 mph) recorded on the Automated Surface Observing Systems at both Barnstable Municipal Airport in Hyannis, MA (KHYA) and Logan International Airport in Boston, MA (KBOS). Rainfall amounts ranged from nearly zero (0.03 at Nantucket Memorial Airport - ACK) to nearly 10 inches (9.92 in Conway, MA). ||Despite the relatively low wind speeds, sustained winds over a 6 to 12 hour long duration resulted in widespread tree damage and resulted in power outages to roughly half a million customers throughout the state. Some of these customers did not get their power back until the Friday following the storm (some five days later). Durring the passage of Tropical Storm Irene, the winds resulted in $60M in property damages and inland flooding resulted in 1 fatality and $8M in property damages. ||Bunnell Brook in Burlington had its third worst flood on record.  The Farmington River reached its highest levels since Tropical Storms Connie and Diane in 1955.||The collective effects of Tropical Storm Irene on August 28, resulted in 1 fatality, 0 injuries, and $127.3M in property damage in the following counties: Barnstable, Bristol, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, Middlesex, Nantucket, Norfolk, Plymouth, Suffolk, and Worcester (all in MA), Hartford, Tolland, and Windham (all in CT), Cheshire and Hillsborough (all in NH), and Bristol, Providence, Kent, Washington, and Newport (all in RI).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Four to ten inches of heavy rain from Tropical Storm Irene resulted in the Pequabuck River overflowing its banks.

He drowned when his canoe capsized and he was unable to make it to shore.  At least 50 people were evacuated from areas around the river, and took shelter at Chippens Hill Middle School.

Several locations in the Susquehanna Basin came close to records set by Hurricane Agnes (June 1972) and a few points (Bloomsburg, Hershey and Loyalsockville) set new floods of record. Flooding along Swatara Creek resulted in property damage and several deaths. Severe flooding occurred along Loyalsock Creek and many points along the main-stem of the Susquehanna River. The interaction of a stalled frontal boundary over the Mid-Atlantic region, a strong northern stream short-wave (with a persistent jet entrance region) and deep tropical moisture associated the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee resulted in multi-day, significant heavy rainfall event over Pennsylvania. ||Tropical storm Lee was the twelfth named storm of the 2011 season forming over the Gulf of Mexico on September 1. A strong northern stream short-wave interacted with Lee causing the storm to re-curve to the north-northeast. By 1200 UTC September 6, having undergone extra-tropical transition, post-tropical Lee was located over northern Georgia. The surface low weakened as it moved up the Appalachian Mountain chain. However, the strong low-level flow and the above normal precipitable water produced an extensive, north-to-south oriented band of heavy rainfall.||The rainfall associated with the remnants of Lee produced the 4th largest flood of record in the Mid-Atlantic Region. The five-day storm rainfall totals for September 5 to 9 were generally in the 5-8 inch range over the mid-section of central Pennsylvania and in the 8-12 inch range in the Susquehanna Valley region. There were local amounts reported in excess of 15 inches east of the Susquehanna River. The local climate sites in Harrisburg (KMDT) and Williamsport (KIPT) reported 13.44 and 9.03 inches respectively. On September 7, 2011 both KMDT and KIPT set their all-time daily (24-hour) rainfall for the month of September at 7.71 and 6.76 inches respectively. These sites later went on to break the all-time monthly (September) and annual precipitation records, making 2011 the wettest year on record.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Susquehanna River at Marietta crested in major flood stage at 58.16 feet.  Flood stage is 49.0 feet.  This is the 4th highest crest on record. The Conestoga River at Lancaster crested in major flood stage at 21.30 feet.  Flood stage is 11.0 feet.  This is the 2nd highest crest on record.||Life-threatening flash flooding affected a large part of western Lancaster County, inlcuding Elizabethtown, Manheim, Marietta and Columbia.||Mudslides, trapped motorists and flooded homes were widespread from Elizabethtown to Columbia in northwest Lancaster County.  Mount Joy and Marietta also experience major flooding.||At one point on the afternoon of the 8th, emergency dispatchers were handling more than a call per minute from stranded drivers and homeowners experiencing flooding.  The flooded roadways severely limited responders��� ability to reach those in need.  In Elizabethtown the only north-south road accessible was Mount Joy Road. A particularly dangerous water rescue occurred at 5pm when Maryland State Police helicopters rescued six motorists after their vehicles (large trucks) became disabled on East Main Street in Mount Joy. Multiple vehicles were stranded on Route 30 westbound at Prospect Road, west of Mountville. Mudslides closed parts of Route 441 and Elizabethtown Road. Most of the above mentioned Townships declared States of Emergency during this flood.  20 municipalities in total declared disasters. Cocalico Creek raged out of its banks during this event, flooding many locations in Ephrata Borough and Township.  At least 20 homes were condemned there, including an apartment building.  Water covered the bridge and all of Main Street.||Major flooding occurred along Chickies Creek in and near the Manheim area.  The southern side of Manheim was underwater from flooding along the creek, resulting in a significant number of structures flooding.   Route 72 was underwater from the creek.  At one point, cars were described as ���floating��� down Main Street in Manheim.  The Twin Kiss restaurant at Fruitville Pike and Main Street was partially submerged under about 4 feet of water.  Mayor Eric Phillips described Manheim as almost an island surrounded by rising floodwaters at one point during the storm. The Manheim Twin Kiss, a Manheim institution here for decades, had 3 feet of the water wash through it which toppled commercial refrigerators and other massive objects. In West Hempfield Township, a crew in boats helped a couple evacuate their home near Siegrist and Farmdale roads.||The 156 year-old Siegrist's Mill Bridge in Rapho Township was lost, as it was ravaged by flood waters from Chickies Creek on the afternoon of the 8th. During Agnes, the bridge shifted a few feet and was cemented back into place. Two other county-owned covered bridges, as well as two other conventional bridges, were closed for repairs because of the storm damage. They included Little Chickies No. 2 on Pinkerton Road, Little Chickies No. 4 on Drager Road, Big Conestoga No. 6, also called the Pinetown covered bridge on Bridge Road and Little Conestoga No. 1 on Shreiner Station Road.||Flooding along the Susquehanna was also reported in the Marietta area.  Structure flooding was widespread along several streets near the river.  A traditional Marietta measuring stick, at Shank's Tavern on Front Street, showed a watermark about 3 feet up the structure. That mark was a couple feet short of archived watermarks from a 1936 flood and the Hurricane Agnes flooding of 1972.||On the Conestoga River, Lancaster city officials evacuated residents from low-lying areas of Almanac Avenue and South Broad Street, near the river.  Crews also evacuated 25 people from Conestoga Boulevard in Conestoga Township, going door to door to ask them to leave their homes. Hundreds of roads were closed across the county, a county dispatch supervisor said. Parts of major routes were closed, including routes 222, 30, 23, 72, 441, 230, 322, 741 and 772.||PPL ordered the evacuation of its Holtwood Hydroelectric Plant on Thursday afternoon. The generating plant was shut down and about 20 plant employees were evacuated, beginning about 4 p.m. Another 80 workers involved in the ongoing $434 million expansion of the plant also were evacuated. The last time the hydroelectric plant went through an emergency shutdown and was evacuated was probably during Agnes, a PPL spokesman said.||Three deaths were noted in Lancaster County.	A 62-year-old woman in a vehicle became stranded on Route 322 near Pumping Station Road in Elizabeth Township Thursday morning. Her car was swept away in the water and submerged. An 8-year-old boy playing in a flooded backyard in East Cocalico Township was swept off his feet by the water. His head became caught in a submerged storm drain, where he was found by emergency personnel. He was taken to Ephrata Community Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A man was swept away as he tried to walk through water just off White Oak Road, near the border of Rapho and Penn townships.||A preliminary total of 32 structures were destroyed, 395 suffered major damage, and 1339 minor damage with a total of 1782 structures impacted. Damage was estimated at $818,110 for public facilities.  A total of 189 water rescues were performed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 800.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several locations in the Susquehanna Basin came close to records set by Hurricane Agnes (June 1972) and a few points (Bloomsburg, Hershey and Loyalsockville) set new floods of record. Flooding along Swatara Creek resulted in property damage and several deaths. Severe flooding occurred along Loyalsock Creek and many points along the main-stem of the Susquehanna River. The interaction of a stalled frontal boundary over the Mid-Atlantic region, a strong northern stream short-wave (with a persistent jet entrance region) and deep tropical moisture associated the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee resulted in multi-day, significant heavy rainfall event over Pennsylvania. ||Tropical storm Lee was the twelfth named storm of the 2011 season forming over the Gulf of Mexico on September 1. A strong northern stream short-wave interacted with Lee causing the storm to re-curve to the north-northeast. By 1200 UTC September 6, having undergone extra-tropical transition, post-tropical Lee was located over northern Georgia. The surface low weakened as it moved up the Appalachian Mountain chain. However, the strong low-level flow and the above normal precipitable water produced an extensive, north-to-south oriented band of heavy rainfall.||The rainfall associated with the remnants of Lee produced the 4th largest flood of record in the Mid-Atlantic Region. The five-day storm rainfall totals for September 5 to 9 were generally in the 5-8 inch range over the mid-section of central Pennsylvania and in the 8-12 inch range in the Susquehanna Valley region. There were local amounts reported in excess of 15 inches east of the Susquehanna River. The local climate sites in Harrisburg (KMDT) and Williamsport (KIPT) reported 13.44 and 9.03 inches respectively. On September 7, 2011 both KMDT and KIPT set their all-time daily (24-hour) rainfall for the month of September at 7.71 and 6.76 inches respectively. These sites later went on to break the all-time monthly (September) and annual precipitation records, making 2011 the wettest year on record.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Swatara Creek at Harper Tavern crested at record/major flood stage, 24.46 feet.

Governor Schweitzer deployed the Montana National Guard in Roundup and Crow Agency to help with flood response efforts May 28th and 29th. Flood emergencies were declared by the Governor for all but three counties in the Billings Forecast area. Emergency declarations included the Crow Reservation in Big Horn County. There were two fatalities, an elderly woman in Boyd in Carbon County fell into a flooded ditch and was swept away, and a man from Huntley in Yellowstone County was killed on an excavator when flooding from Pryor Creek overtook him. Multiple Emergency Operation Centers and Incident Commands were set up across the area, including in Billings in Yellowstone County, and in Park County to coordinate flood relief and response efforts.||A persistant upslope northeast flow into the region resulted in another round of locally heavy rainfall again on May 29-30th. An additional 1-2 inches of rainfall were noted, especially for the Beartooth and Big Horn Mountain foothill areas. This resulted in prolonged or even renewed flooding in some locations through the end of the month.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Significant flooding occurred on creeks and streams across Carbon County with numerous county roads flooded, closing roads and resulting in significant damage.

Creeks were running out of their banks from the Beartooth Foothills between McLeod and Red Lodge, as well as tributaries of the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River from Belfry to Bridger. Five Mile Creek flooded and washed out the bridge on East Pryor Road between Edgar and Pryor. Blue Water Creek east of Bridger flooded and washed out a county road as well. The heavy rainfall also resulted in water running over the spillway at Cooney Dam. This resulted in several homes flooded along Red Lodge Creek. ||On May 25th, significant flooding was reported in the town of Joliet as debris backed up Rock Creek resulting in evacuations. At the peak of this flooding, Highway 212 was closed from Rockvale to Red Lodge as 18 inches of water was reported on Highway 212 through the town of Joliet. Fifty homes flooded in the area and seven people, mainly elderly, had to leave with the assistance of the fire and sheriffs offices. The Joliet Motel reported a foot of water in each of their rooms. ||In addition, an 84-year-old woman drowned after she fell into a flooded ditch near her house.

Part of the asphalt pavement on U.S. Highway 70 was scoured away by the water between DeValls Bluff and Biscoe. The force of the water left holes two feet deep on Arkansas Highway 38 in the northern part of the county. Dozens of houses flooded in the Des Arc area and evacuations were necessary in DeValls Bluff. Altogether, more than 270 homes in the county suffered flood damage. On the 4th, a 53 year-old man was found drowned near his home in the North Side community near Des Arc. On the 4th, westbound lanes of Interstate 40 near Biscoe were closed when the White River overflowed onto the freeway. Motorists traveling from Memphis to Little Rock had to exit the interstate at Brinkley, take U.S. Highway 49 north to Fair Oaks, then U.S. Highway 64 to Bald Knob, then U.S. Highway 67/167 to Little Rock. This detour was about 120 miles long. On the 5th, the flood waters overtook the eastbound lanes of the interstate, making it the first time that the interstate had ever been closed by flooding on the White River. Motorists exited the interstate at Hazen and took U.S. Highway 63 to Stuttgart, then U.S. Highway 165 to DeWitt, then Arkansas Highway 1 back to the interstate at Forrest City. The eastbound detour lasted only one day before the White River flooded Arkansas Highway 1 at the Arkansas/Monroe County line and a new detour had to be established. The new detour took cars from Interstate 40 south on U.S. Highway 63 to Stuttgart, east on U.S. Highway 79 to U.S. Highway 49, and then north on 49 back to the interstate. Because the bridge over the White River is old and narrow with very narrow shoulders, trucks were unable to use this route and had to take a much longer detour. Trucks went south to Dumas via U.S. Highways 63, 79, and 65 or via U.S. Highways 63 and 165. From Dumas, the trucks followed U.S. Highway 65 south all the way to Lake Village, crossed the Mississippi River on U.S. Highway 82 through Greenville, Mississippi, and then turned north on U.S. Highway 61 to Memphis. Altogether, the truck detour added about 300 miles onto the trip from Little Rock to Memphis. Water on I-40 eventually rose to the top of the concrete wall in the median. The eastbound lanes of Interstate 40 reopened on the 9th, followed by the westbound lanes on the 11th.

These two systems brought a total of 4 to 7 inches of precipitation to the area through the 25th. From May 29th through May 31st, another Pacific storm system moved northeast through the Billings Forecast Area, producing a half inch to 2 inches of precipitation across the area. A few areas received close to 3 inches of precipitation. The culmination of precipitation events resulted in historic flooding across the Billings Forecast Area. The monthly precipitation for May resulted in the wettest May ever recorded in Billings.||Widespread, severe flooding occurred across the entire Billings Forecast Area. Many roads and bridges were damaged or washed out across the area, including closure of I-90 between Livingston and Springdale eastbound lanes. The Montana Department of Transportation alone estimated over $36 million in damage to state and federal highways across the state of Montana. Hundreds of homes and trailers and multiple businesses experienced flood damage. There was damage to flood control dams. On May 19th, Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer declared an emergency for the state. In addition, the Governor requested that the President declare a major disaster for the State of Montana on June 1st, as a result of substantial widespread flooding. Governor Schweitzer deployed the Montana National Guard in Roundup and Crow Agency to help with flood response efforts May 28th and 29th. Flood emergencies were declared by the Governor for all but three counties in the Billings Forecast area. Emergency declarations included the Crow Reservation in Big Horn County. There were two fatalities, an elderly woman in Boyd in Carbon County fell into a flooded ditch and was swept away, and a man from Huntley in Yellowstone County was killed on an excavator when flooding from Pryor Creek overtook him. Multiple Emergency Operation Centers and Incident Commands were set up across the area, including in Billings in Yellowstone County, and in Park County to coordinate flood relief and response efforts.||A persistant upslope northeast flow into the region resulted in another round of locally heavy rainfall again on May 29-30th. An additional 1-2 inches of rainfall were noted, especially for the Beartooth and Big Horn Mountain foothill areas. This resulted in prolonged or even renewed flooding in some locations through the end of the month.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Widespread rainfall of 2 to 3 inches with locally higher amounts fell across the Yellowstone County area during a two day period. Billings had its all-time daily rainfall record broke on May 24th with 3.12 inches. This was just a part of a record setting precipitation month for Billings which totaled 9.54 inches. This rainfall on top of an already wet month resulted in some streams and creeks over Southern Yellowstone County to overflow their banks. Flooding occurred on Blue Creek in the Briarwood area. Several homes and structures were surrounded by water on Aviemore Court where some voluntary evacuations occurred. In addition, the Briarwood Golf Course was inundated with water.||Pryor Creek was out of its banks resulting in water spilling over a dike in a low lying area of Huntley. Fly Creek near Pompey was out of its banks and flooded a roadway leading to town. Flooding occurred along most of Pryor Creek between the towns of Pryor and Huntley. In addition, county officials reported that Pryor Creek Road Bridge between Interstates 90 and 94 was washed out.||Blue Creek Subdivision at Jene Helene Avenue flooded many homes and the Briarwood Golf Club May 20th-22nd. This resulted in the Billings Fire Department issuing voluntary evacuation orders. In addition, flash flooding occurred in Billings on May 24th forcing many road closures downtown and causing large boulders to fall off the Rimrocks.

The tornado crossed the Arkansas River, moving back into Franklin County from Logan County. The tornado crossed Carbon Plant Road and W Creek Road, destroying a mobile home and killing another person. It continued northeast across the town of Denning where it destroyed numerous permanent homes and mobile homes. At least 10 injuries occurred in Denning as the mile-wide tornado moved through the town.

Actually, this particular cell was responsible for two other tornadoes, one in southeast Louisiana and another in west-central Alabama. This activity occurred as an upper level disturbance moved over the region and combined with increasing wind shear and instability. Initially the storm activity associated with this disturbance was rather weak. However, after 3 am, there was a resurgence in activity, and storms intensified across southeast Louisiana, and southern and southeast Mississippi. The storm that produced all the damage developed in a location where instability and high wind shear were maximized. The result was a cyclic supercell that produced several tornadoes. Across the NWS Jackson service area, three tornadoes impacted four counties: Marion, Jefferson Davis, Jones, and Jasper. Two of the tornadoes were rated EF1 and the other rated EF2. Nearly two dozen structures were damaged or destroyed by these tornadoes and 15 people were injured.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado developed along Pat Holifield and Leroy Hill Roads, downing a few trees. The tornado moved northeast, widened and reached its maximum width in the area of Springhill Road, where high end EF-1 damage to trees occurred. The tornado then narrowed to about 150 to 250 yard wide path of mid to high end EF-2 damage on either side of State Highway 15 in the Shady Grove community northwest of Laurel. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed, numerous power poles were snapped, several frame and brick homes suffered major damage and other moderate damage, and extensive tree damage occurred. A few commercial buildings along State Highway 15 suffered major damage. As the tornado continued northeast across northeast Jones County, it caused EF-1 type damage as it crossed Sharon-Moss and Lake Como Roads, snapping and uprooting trees and causing some roof and minor structural damage to several homes. The tornado then intensified somewhat again as it crossed into Jasper County, destroying three large chicken houses and causing extensive tree damage along County Road 812 just inside the Jasper County line. The tornado dissipated shortly after causing this damage. Fifteen people were injured by this tornado, with nearly all of the injuries being relatively minor.

The tornado became very strong and increased in size as it approached and crossed highway 324 in the Ogden Community, near its intersection with Skyline Rd and Williamson Rd. Around a dozen homes were damaged in this area, with one double-wide mobile home being rolled about 75 yards. Two occupants of this home were killed. Another man was killed when the roof of his home was blown off, causing a chimney to collapse on him. Five other people were injured in the Ogden area. A number of sheds and outbuildings were damaged or destroyed and several automobiles were also flipped. The tornado lifted east of Skyline Rd, just short of Vernsdale Rd. The tornado was the strongest to hit York County in almost 40 years, and was the county's first known killer tornado since 1926.

In the wake of this system, hundreds of people were left injured and/or homeless, along with approximately 100 people who lost their lives in the northern Alabama area alone. Some of the devastation was literally unimaginable with countless homes, neighborhoods and even portions of cities or towns either partially or completely destroyed. This storm system would be responsible for one of the largest and deadliest tornado outbreaks to ever impact much of the southeastern region.| |The powerful storm system that affected the National Weather Service, Huntsville service area would actually occur in three separate waves of severe weather that day. The first occurred during the early morning hours of April 27, 2011 roughly between the hours of 2 AM and 8 AM CDT, while the second occurred during the late-morning to early afternoon period. The third and most devastating wave occurred during the afternoon hours on Wednesday, with some of the most violent and destructive tornadoes to affect the central Tennessee Valley area in recent decades.| |The worst areas impacted by these storms included the towns of Phil Campbell and Oak Grove in eastern Franklin County Alabama, Mt. Hope in western Lawrence County and the Tanner Community in eastern Limestone County. Along a line connecting these areas tracked an EF5 tornado with peak winds around 210 mph, the strongest and most violent on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. ||Other areas impacted by the storms include the city of Cullman, where extensive damage occurred to buildings in the downtown area, and to the town of Fairview, both of which are located in Cullman County. Downstream, further significant damage occurred to the Ruth and Oak Grove communities in Marshall County. In addition, the communities of Rainsville and Sylvania along with the towns of Henagar and Ider in DeKalb County were severely impacted. Fatalities in DeKalb County alone numbered at least 33 people. Furthermore, the towns of Flat Rock, Higdon and Pisgah in Jackson County sustained incredible damage. The tornadoes that affected these areas were rated as an EF4 with maximum winds near 190 mph.||In most of these areas alone, numerous people lost their lives. These represent just several of the communities and towns impacted by the events of April 27, 2011. While the majority of the analysis and survey work conducted by the National Weather Service, Huntsville and its partners have been completed, there will undoubtedly be countless research studies conducted by both academia and operational personnel in order to further evaluate and understand the complex processes associated with this near unprecedented severe weather outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A violent long track tornado began in the Lakeview community northeast of Geraldine before tracking northeastward, generally parallel to and just east of State Route 75.  Along this line, the tornado passed through Fyffe, Rainsville, Sylvania, and eventually into northern DeKalb County south of the Cartersville community, killing 25 people. On the first day of surveys, the survey team noticed initial damage in the Lakeview community where the path width was generally around 50 yards.  This initial damage included mostly felled and snapped trees and structural damage to small buildings.  Extensive damage was noted especially in Rainsville and Sylvania where the path width was estimated to over 1/2 mile wide.  Damage in Rainsville included houses that were completely removed from foundations, with debris scattered for about one mile.  Near this location, trees were debarked and a few mobile homes were completely destroyed, with debris strewn for about a mile downstream.||A narrow corridor of intense damage extended from Skaggs Road to Lingerfeldt Road (also known as County Road 180), extending toward County Road 514.  Along Skaggs Road, a stone house was completely obliterated with much of the interior debris strewn well away from the structure.  A supporting large cement stone pillar was ripped completely out of the ground.  Another home along Skaggs Road was also leveled completely to the ground. The NOAA overflight showed significant ground scarring in this area and a walk through the nearby fields showed large pot marks and other sections of disturbed ground. ||Slightly northeast along Lingerfeldt Road, numerous homes were leveled completely to their foundation with vehicles and debris strewn for hundreds of feet.  Overhead photos and follow-up visual confirmation revealed a mangled vehicle tossed well into a ravine and resting up in the remainder of trees.  At  1608 Lingerfeldt Road/County Road 180, a large two story brick home was completely obliterated with several of the supporting anchors ripped of the ground.  A concrete porch was ripped off with pieces strewn up to 150 yards.  A section of the asphalt driveway was pulled up.  In addition, an anchored liberty safe weighing 800 pounds was pulled off its anchorage and thrown into a wooded area 600 feet away.  When found, the safe's door had been ripped open and completely off.  A large pick-up truck at this residence was found mangled in pieces over 250 yards away in the same wooded area.  The residents of the home survived in a nearby storm pit.  Of note, the storm pit was partially exposed by the tornado with dirt being sucked up and pulled away around the opening.  Next door, a mobile home was completely disintegrated.  The residents of the mobile there also survived in a storm pit.  The section of damage from Skaggs Road to Lingerfeldt Road near the intersection with Crow Lane was deemed to be EF-5 intensity.   Severe damage with high end EF-4 damage was noted in a corridor from County Road 515 through a neighborhood along County Road 441.  In the east and south ends of the neighborhood, many one and two story homes were leveled to their foundation with debris scattered some distance.  Several cars were thrown a large distance in this area.  There was evidence of ground scarring as well as some sidewalk pavement pulled up in this location.  However, some of the homes in this area appeared to be pushed off their foundation initially with limited anchorage. ||In the Sylvania community, similar situation occurred with houses completely removed from foundations and debris blown far downstream.  Some of these houses were connected to their foundations with anchor bolts and foundation straps, indicating a stronger construction of the homes. ||Tornado damage continued from the Blake community, intersecting County Road 27, running parallel between State Highway 75 and Interstate 59 through Henager, Ider, to south of Cartersville.  ||In the Blake community, the tornado path width was estimated to be one half to three quarters of a mile.  Along County Road 27 just southeast of Sylvania, significant damage was observed .  All exterior and interior walls of several homes were completely destroyed with partial block and mortar foundations remaining.  In one instance, a concrete slab that served as a porch was displaced a few feet and broken in half.  Some hardwood trees in the area were stripped with no stubs of any branches remaining and were partially debarked.  The Mountain View Baptist Church sustained significant damage.  An old, one-story portion of the church dating back to 1902 and constructed of a brick and mortar exterior on wood frame walls was completely destroyed.  A recent two-story addition to the church was constructed in 2004 and consisting of similar building materials was partially destroyed, with most exterior walls and nearly all interior walls fallen.  A concrete block and mortar foundation was all that remained of a hallway adjoining the two buildings.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong tornado touched down in Rabun County late on the 27th, with additional tornadoes affecting the North Carolina foothills during the early morning hours of the 28th. At least three supercell thunderstorms crossed the western Carolinas and northeast Georgia during this time. A greater number of supercells and tornadoes affected areas to the west of the Appalachians. Scattered areas of straight line wind damage and large hail also accompanied the storms.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The path of an intense tornado, which was likely the continuation of the Habersham County tornado, was found in Rabun County beginning in the Lake Burton area. Damage was first found near a marina on Wildcat Creek Cove. A fire department building near this location was destroyed. As the tornado moved northeast across Moccasin Creek, it intensified and widened to around one half mile. Several large lake homes were completely destroyed in this area. Another home slid off its foundation into the lake. The tornado continued northeast across the Moccasin Creek peninsula and over the main channel of Lake Burton. Severe damage was observed again along the north shore of Timpson Cove, roughly paralleling Meeting House Mountain Rd. Several large luxury homes along the shore were destroyed, while many others received major structural damage. One 83-year-old man was killed in one of these homes. In addition to the major structural damage, thousands of trees were blown down in the Lake Burton area. The tornado weakened as it crossed highway 76 just northeast of Timpson Cove, proceeding to Black Rock State Park, where hundreds of additional trees were blown down. As the tornado continued northeast from the state park, it intensified slightly as it moved over a residential area in Mountain City. Half of the roof was blown off a condominium building, while surrounding homes had minor to moderate roof damage. The tornado crossed highway 441 just north of Mountain City and appeared to lift in the Oakey Mountain area.

A strong tornado touched down in Rabun County late on the 27th, with additional tornadoes affecting the North Carolina foothills during the early morning hours of the 28th. At least three supercell thunderstorms crossed the western Carolinas and northeast Georgia during this time. A greater number of supercells and tornadoes affected areas to the west of the Appalachians. Scattered areas of straight line wind damage and large hail also accompanied the storms.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The path of an intense tornado, which was likely the continuation of the Habersham County tornado, was found in Rabun County beginning in the Lake Burton area. Damage was first found near a marina on Wildcat Creek Cove. A fire department building near this location was destroyed. As the tornado moved northeast across Moccasin Creek, it intensified and widened to around one half mile. Several large lake homes were completely destroyed in this area. Another home slid off its foundation into the lake. The tornado continued northeast across the Moccasin Creek peninsula and over the main channel of Lake Burton. Severe damage was observed again along the north shore of Timpson Cove, roughly paralleling Meeting House Mountain Rd. Several large luxury homes along the shore were destroyed, while many others received major structural damage. One 83-year-old man was killed in one of these homes. In addition to the major structural damage, thousands of trees were blown down in the Lake Burton area. The tornado weakened as it crossed highway 76 just northeast of Timpson Cove, proceeding to Black Rock State Park, where hundreds of additional trees were blown down. As the tornado continued northeast from the state park, it intensified slightly as it moved over a residential area in Mountain City. Half of the roof was blown off a condominium building, while surrounding homes had minor to moderate roof damage. The tornado crossed highway 441 just north of Mountain City and appeared to lift in the Oakey Mountain area. The tornado was very unusual not only for its strength but also for the rugged terrain in which it occurred. It was the first tornado to hit Rabun County since 1983 and the first F3 or EF3 tornado in the county's recorded history.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The result was a large outbreak of severe weather including strong and deadly tornadoes across eastern North Carolina.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service Storm Survey Team found evidence of a strong tornado in  Bladen County, North Carolina. The damage was rated up to an EF2. The maximum wind speed was estimated up to 120 mph.  The path length was just over 13 miles. The maximum path width was 440 yards. The tornado first touched down at 458 pm EDT in downtown Bladenboro at the intersection of Seaboard Street and Highway 242. A  gas station had its asphalt roof entirely ripped off and tossed into the aluminum awning over the pumps, damaging the awning. A small industrial building also had its asphalt roof entirely removed and tossed 30 yards downwind. The tornado then came entirely to the ground decimating a grove of about 75 trees, consisting of maple and oak, some up to 2 ft in diameter. The path width at this point was approximately 150 yards. The damage was rated EF1 with winds up to 100 mph. |The tornado tracked along and just west of Highway 242 causing damage to a series of singlewide mobile homes. Of these homes, one un-mounted home was flipped onto its side, a second was partially destroyed, while a third had its entire metal roof ripped off and tossed up into a tree. Just beyond these homes the Bladenboro EMS |building was also damaged. Partial uplift of the roof of this brick building was noted, as well as the complete destruction of a small shed. In addition, many large hardwood trees were uprooted. This damage was rated EF1 with winds to 100 mph.|The tornado then widened to 200 yards as it moved across a neighborhood of mobile homes in the Ronald Britt Road area. Almost every tree in this neighborhood, mostly consisting of oak, was snapped about halfway up the trunk. Many of the homes sustained at least minor cosmetic damage. Three of the homes were completely destroyed including one in which even the debris had been deposited well downwind of where the home initially stood. There was one fatality in this location.  Damage in this neighborhood was rated up to EF2 with winds to 120 mph. The tornado widened further as it moved adjacent to Highway 242. Near Bill Crawley Road at around 508 pm, a single wide mobile home was completely demolished and its debris was spread 50 yards to the other side of Highway 242. Up to 80 percent of all trees were snapped or uprooted in this area. The tornado then crossed back across Highway 242 and reached its maximum path width of 440 yards as it crossed Guyton Road and encountered a series of single family homes. A large brick home had approximately half of its roof destroyed and blown away while the other homes suffered significant cosmetic damage. Additionally, a few empty galvanized steel grain silos were lifted and moved 100 yards. This damage was rated EF2 with winds around 120 mph. |The tornado continued across mostly forested areas before impacting the Hayfield neighborhood of Elizabethtown around 512 pm. Extensive damage was observed between Singletary Avenue and Doll Street. A well constructed home had its roof partially lifted, causing the exterior walls to bow out. Significant structural damage was noted to the roof and to the upper portion of the exterior walls. Many other homes in this neighborhood experienced significant cosmetic damage. As the tornado moved across Cromartie Road, it snapped or uprooted virtually all of the trees in the area as its width decreased to about 300 yards. Most of the observed structural damage to homes was from falling trees. The damage directly related to winds was mostly cosmetic with shingles torn off and siding damaged. As the tornado crossed Highway 87, it made a direct hit on Elizabethtown Baptist Church. Moderate roof damage was noted to several of the buildings, and a brick covered walkway was almost completely leveled. The damage in this area was rated EF1 with winds to 100 mph. The tornado then moved across mostly rural and forested areas as it began to weaken. The tornado crossed Highway 53, taking down a swath of pine trees 100 yards wide, some of which blocked the road. This damage was rated EF1 with winds to 95 mph. At this point the tornado began to lift and subsequent tree damage was more consistent with straight line winds.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Instability and shear values were highly supportive of super-cell thunderstorms. The result was a large outbreak of severe weather including strong and deadly tornadoes across eastern North Carolina.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service Storm Survey Team found evidence of a strong tornado in  Bladen County, North Carolina. The damage was rated up to an EF2. The maximum wind speed was estimated up to 120 mph.  The path length was just over 13 miles. The maximum path width was 440 yards. The tornado first touched down at 458 pm EDT in downtown Bladenboro at the intersection of Seaboard Street and Highway 242. A  gas station had its asphalt roof entirely ripped off and tossed into the aluminum awning over the pumps, damaging the awning. A small industrial building also had its asphalt roof entirely removed and tossed 30 yards downwind. The tornado then came entirely to the ground decimating a grove of about 75 trees, consisting of maple and oak, some up to 2 ft in diameter. The path width at this point was approximately 150 yards. The damage was rated EF1 with winds up to 100 mph. |The tornado tracked along and just west of Highway 242 causing damage to a series of singlewide mobile homes. Of these homes, one un-mounted home was flipped onto its side, a second was partially destroyed, while a third had its entire metal roof ripped off and tossed up into a tree. Just beyond these homes the Bladenboro EMS |building was also damaged. Partial uplift of the roof of this brick building was noted, as well as the complete destruction of a small shed. In addition, many large hardwood trees were uprooted. This damage was rated EF1 with winds to 100 mph.|The tornado then widened to 200 yards as it moved across a neighborhood of mobile homes in the Ronald Britt Road area. Almost every tree in this neighborhood, mostly consisting of oak, was snapped about halfway up the trunk. Many of the homes sustained at least minor cosmetic damage. Three of the homes were completely destroyed including one in which even the debris had been deposited well downwind of where the home initially stood. There was one fatality in this location.  Damage in this neighborhood was rated up to EF2 with winds to 120 mph. The tornado widened further as it moved adjacent to Highway 242. Near Bill Crawley Road at around 508 pm, a single wide mobile home was completely demolished and its debris was spread 50 yards to the other side of Highway 242. Up to 80 percent of all trees were snapped or uprooted in this area. The tornado then crossed back across Highway 242 and reached its maximum path width of 440 yards as it crossed Guyton Road and encountered a series of single family homes. A large brick home had approximately half of its roof destroyed and blown away while the other homes suffered significant cosmetic damage. Additionally, a few empty galvanized steel grain silos were lifted and moved 100 yards. This damage was rated EF2 with winds around 120 mph. |The tornado continued across mostly forested areas before impacting the Hayfield neighborhood of Elizabethtown around 512 pm. Extensive damage was observed between Singletary Avenue and Doll Street. A well constructed home had its roof partially lifted, causing the exterior walls to bow out. Significant structural damage was noted to the roof and to the upper portion of the exterior walls. Many other homes in this neighborhood experienced significant cosmetic damage. As the tornado moved across Cromartie Road, it snapped or uprooted virtually all of the trees in the area as its width decreased to about 300 yards. Most of the observed structural damage to homes was from falling trees. The damage directly related to winds was mostly cosmetic with shingles torn off and siding damaged. As the tornado crossed Highway 87, it made a direct hit on Elizabethtown Baptist Church. Moderate roof damage was noted to several of the buildings, and a brick covered walkway was almost completely leveled. The damage in this area was rated EF1 with winds to 100 mph. The tornado then moved across mostly rural and forested areas as it began to weaken. The tornado crossed Highway 53, taking down a swath of pine trees 100 yards wide, some of which blocked the road. This damage was rated EF1 with winds to 95 mph. At this point the tornado began to lift and subsequent tree damage was more consistent with straight line winds.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.

All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia confirmed that the EF0 tornado, which first touched down in north central Troup county, continued across far southeast Heard county before moving into southwest Coweta county.  The tornado strengthened to an EF1 rating through much of Heard county and into Coweta county.  A little over four miles of the tornado path was within southeast Heard county, while the entire path length of this tornado was on the order of 17 miles.  The maximum path width was determined to be 100 yards with maximum winds of 90 mph.  Much of the structural damage associated with this tornado occurred within Heard county, especially in an around the city of Corinth in the far southeast corner of the county.  A hauling and horse trailer were damaged as they were thrown about 20 feet from their original location.  Three homes and/or businesses were destroyed, two others suffered major damage, and an additional 10 others sustained minor damage.  One home lost two exterior walls and its roof.  Thousands of trees were uprooted along the path of the tornado.

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening. The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 21 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 21, 11 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5.

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia confirmed that a second tornado touched down in Troup county, approximately five miles south of LaGrange and then traveled approximately seven miles to the northeast before lifting six miles east of LaGrange.  This tornado was an EF2, had a maximum path width of 1/4 mile, with maximum winds estimated to be 120 mph.  The tornado did cross Interstate-185 east of LaGrange.  Fifteen homes were destroyed along the path of the tornado and another 50 homes sustained minor to moderate damage.  The most significant damage occurred along Georgia Highway 219 and Murphy Road near the beginning of the tornado's path, or about two miles south of the LaGrange city limits.  About 12 homes were destroyed in this area.  One home in this neighborhood was picked up and thrown 50 feet while its sun room was thrown 300 yards.  A well built log cabin on a hillside was completely destroyed as it was blown off its foundation in the opposite direction of the tornado's movement.   While no fatalities occurred admist all of this damage, there were six injuries resulting from debris and damaged homes.  Thousands of trees and many power lines were also down along the path of the tornado.||A total of 41 residential or commercial structures in Troup county were either destroyed, suffered major damage, or sustained minor to moderate damage from the two tornadoes this evening.||It should be noted that the same thunderstorm that spawned this tornado continued on to spawn yet another tornado that tracked across northeast Meriwether into western Spalding and southern Henry county shortly after this event and then later spawned additional tornadoes in east central Georgia as the night continued.||[04/27-04/28/11: Tornado #9, County #1-1, EF2, Troup, 2011:018].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia confirmed that a second tornado touched down in Troup county, approximately five miles south of LaGrange and then traveled approximately seven miles to the northeast before lifting six miles east of LaGrange.  This tornado was an EF2, had a maximum path width of 1/4 mile, with maximum winds estimated to be 120 mph.  The tornado did cross Interstate-185 east of LaGrange.  Fifteen homes were destroyed along the path of the tornado and another 50 homes sustained minor to moderate damage.  The most significant damage occurred along Georgia Highway 219 and Murphy Road near the beginning of the tornado's path, or about two miles south of the LaGrange city limits.  About 12 homes were destroyed in this area.  One home in this neighborhood was picked up and thrown 50 feet while its sun room was thrown 300 yards.  A well built log cabin on a hillside was completely destroyed as it was blown off its foundation in the opposite direction of the tornado's movement.   While no fatalities occurred admist all of this damage, there were six injuries resulting from debris and damaged homes.  Thousands of trees and many power lines were also down along the path of the tornado.||A total of 41 residential or commercial structures in Troup county were either destroyed, suffered major damage, or sustained minor to moderate damage from the two tornadoes this evening.||It should be noted that the same thunderstorm that spawned this tornado continued on to spawn yet another tornado that tracked across northeast Meriwether into western Spalding and southern Henry county shortly after this event and then later spawned additional tornadoes in east central Georgia as the night continued.||[04/27-04/28/11: Tornado #9, County #1-1, EF2, Troup, 2011:018].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia confirmed that an EF4 tornado, the first of this intensity to occur within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area (CWA), touched down in Catoosa county, just southwest of Ringgold along Davis Ridge Road.  The tornado tracked across Interstate-75 at mile marker 348 then continued on into and through the city of Ringgold before tracking northeast toward Cohutta and then into Hamilton and eventually Bradley county, Tennessee.  The tornado tracked nearly 12 miles through Catoosa county.  Major devastation was observed throughout the north side of the city of Ringgold.  The worst damage occurred on Cherokee Valley Road on the north side of Ringgold where 12 homes were obliterated.  An additional 80 to 90 homes sustained major damage from the tornado.  In addition, several commercial businesses, including restaurants and motels, at exit 348 on Interstate-75 were destroyed.  There were eight fatalities and 30 injuries reported with this tornado.  Seven of the eight deaths occurred on Cherokee Valley Road, which was heavily devastated by the tornado.  Most of the tornado victims lived within 200 yards of each other and were killed when their homes collapsed around them.  Finally, hundreds of trees and dozens of power lines and utility poles were also destroyed by the tornado.  This was by far the deadliest and most devastating of the 15 tornadoes to affect north and central Georgia during this tornado outbreak.||Total damages from Catoosa county consist of 74 destroyed homes and/or businesses, 60 with major damage, and 118 with minor damage for a total of 252 affected structures.||[04/27-04/28/11: Tornado #4, County #1-1, EF4, Catoosa, 2011:013].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia confirmed that the EF3 tornado that first touched down in far southeast Pike county, approximately three miles southeast of Meansville, quickly moved into Lamar county and traveled northeast across the entire distance of Lamar county from just northwest of Piedmont, through the north side of Barnesville, then moving into and across northern Monroe county before finally moving into far southern Butts county and then lifting.  The tornado traveled on the ground slightly over 15 miles within Lamar county.  The total tornado path length was around 30 miles.  The maximum path width of the tornado was 0.6 mile with maximum winds estimated to be 140 mph.  Damage from this tornado in Lamar county was extensive, especially in the Barnesville area.  Three homes along Piedmont Road, approximately three miles west of Barnesville, were completely destroyed by this tornado.  Some homes in Barnesville were also destroyed while many others suffered minor to moderate damage.  Two fatalities occurred at a home on Grove Street in Barnesville, which was destroyed.  A Chervron Gas Station and a church in Barnesville were also destroyed.  There were an additional 12 injuries suffered from damaged homes and property along the tornado's path, mostly in and around Barnesville.||Damage within Lamar county consists of 25 destroyed homes, 20 with major damage, and 40 with minor damage for a total of 85 affected structures.||[04/27-04/28/11: Tornado #12, County #2-4, EF3, Pike-Lamar-Monroe-Butts, 2011:021].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities.

The flash flooding persisted for several days as additional rounds of heavy rain fell over the same region through the 26th of April.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> During the evening of Friday April 22nd, an intense supercell thunderstorm produced a long-track tornado which tore a path of destruction from west to east across the St. Louis Metropolitan Area, from St. Louis County Missouri eastward through the far northern portions of the City of St. Louis, then across the Mississippi River into Madison County Illinois. The tornado reached a maximum intensity of EF4 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale as it tracked through the community of Bridgeton, just west of Lambert St. Louis International Airport, in St. Louis County. The total path length was 21.3 miles, with a width of up to half a mile.||The tornado initially touched down along the northern edge of Creve Coeur Lake at approximately 759 pm.  It tracked nearly due east at about 40 mph, and intensified as it entered Maryland Heights. There it produced up to EF3 damage to many homes and businesses with a damage swath of 200 to 400 yards wide.  Damage continued eastward in an unbroken track, crossing I-270 about 1 mile south of I-70. The tornado reached peak intensity of EF4 as it devastated the community of Bridgeton along Old St. Charles Road.  From there the tornado paralleled Interstate 70 through the community of St. Ann, and then took aim directly on Lambert-St. Louis International Airport.  Many of the large windows in the main terminal building were blown out or damaged by flying debris and a large section of roof was peeled from Concourse C.  Although the vast majority of people were evacuated to lower levels and to interior rooms before the tornado hit, five people were treated and released from area hospitals for injuries due to flying debris. The airport was closed due to the extensive damage.  Damage at the airport was estimated to be between $35 to 40 million.|    |The tornado exited Lambert-St. Louis International Airport crossing near the McDonnell Boulevard/Harmon Lane intersection.  It then moved into Berkeley where it crossed Interstate 170 between Airport Road and Scudder Avenue. Extensive damage was noted along Fourth Avenue, especially at the Garfield Avenue and Hancock Avenue intersections where a vacant house and several homes lost their entire roof structure. The greatest damage in this neighborhood was rated EF2.  The tornado continued to the northeast through neighborhoods south of Airport Road producing significant tree damage including many large trees falling on homes.  The tornado then crossed Airport Road near Abston Street.  The tornado crossed North Florissant Road where it caused extensive roof damage to the Newger Materials building and the First Baptist Church of Ferguson.  Across the road, a Little Caesars Restaurant lost its entire roof. Damage to these structures was rated EF1. The tornado then continued through neighborhoods along and just the north of Hereford Avenue/Chambers Road where it continued to cause extensive tree damage as well as additional partial roof damage to homes along the path toward West Florissant Road.  Also along this part of its path, it partially removed the roof at the Griffith Elementary School which was rated as EF1. This is also where the tornado widened to one quarter of a mile with damage noted to trees and some homes on both sides of Chambers Road.  Along the entire path from Berkeley to Dellwood, damage varied in intensity from EF1 to low end EF2 with a maximum estimated wind speed of 120 mph, and included numerous snapped power poles in addition to the extensive number of snapped and downed trees.||EF2 damage was uncovered at three different locations east of Dellwood. One area was located one quarter mile south of Chambers Road on Halls Ferry Road where four large utility poles were snapped. The second area of EF2 damage was located a quarter of a mile south of Chambers Road along Bellefontaine Road where significant tree damage occurred. The last area of damage was located in Bellefontaine Neighbors just south of Chambers Road on La Roux Court. Roofs were removed from three homes at this location, while other homes sustained varying degrees of damage.  The width of the damage area varies from 100 yards to four tenths of a mile with the widest area of damage east of Halls Ferry and south of Chambers Road. ||The tornadic damage continued as the tornado traveled eastward south of Chambers road, crossing into the far northern portions of the city of St. Louis. The majority of the damage in this area was rated EF1 due to fallen trees. Some of these trees fell on homes while a few others fell through homes causing damage not directly relating to the intensity of the wind within the tornado.  ||Overall, in St. Louis County, 233 structures (homes and businesses) sustained major damage, 776 structures sustained moderate damage, and 1,487 structures sustained minor damage.

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An aerial survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City confirmed that the supercell thunderstorm which had already spawned several tornadoes across Alabama and two in northwest and north central Georgia, including Polk, Floyd, Bartow, and Pickens counties, spawned yet a third tornado in the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area.  This tornado was an EF2 and touched down approximately 2.5 miles west of Turners Corner or the junction of U.S. Highways 129 and 19.  The tornado tracked approximately 5.6 miles across northeast Lumpkin county, crossing U.S. Highways 19/129 approximately 1.6 miles north of Turners Corner and then moving toward Whitley Gap Shelter in extreme northwest White county.  The tornado also crossed the Appalachian Trail in this region.  The tornado continued across northern White county and then eventually into Habersham and finally Rabun counties of northeast Georgia, both of which are under the jurisdiction of the Greenville-Spartanburg National Weather Service Forecast Office.  This tornado caused a death and considerable damage in Rabun county.  The total path length of this tornado was 17.5 miles.  Within Lumpkin county, the tornado tracked mostly through the Chattahoochee National Forest Region.  Thousands of trees were blown down or uprooted along the path of the tornado through the forest and adjacent areas.  Trees blocked parts of U.S. Highway 19/129 where it crossed for several hours.  A total of 14 homes suffered major damage in northern Lumpkin county from the tornado.  Four other structures sustained minor damage.   One injury was reported from one of the damaged homes, with no fatalities.||[04/27-04/28/11: Tornado #7, County #1-2, EF2, Lumpkin-White, 2011:016].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 750.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An aerial survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City confirmed that the supercell thunderstorm which had already spawned several tornadoes across Alabama and two in northwest and north central Georgia, including Polk, Floyd, Bartow, and Pickens counties, spawned yet a third tornado in the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area.  This tornado was an EF2 and touched down approximately 2.5 miles west of Turners Corner or the junction of U.S. Highways 129 and 19.  The tornado tracked approximately 5.6 miles across northeast Lumpkin county, crossing U.S. Highways 19/129 approximately 1.6 miles north of Turners Corner and then moving toward Whitley Gap Shelter in extreme northwest White county.  The tornado also crossed the Appalachian Trail in this region.  The tornado continued across northern White county and then eventually into Habersham and finally Rabun counties of northeast Georgia, both of which are under the jurisdiction of the Greenville-Spartanburg National Weather Service Forecast Office.  This tornado caused a death and considerable damage in Rabun county.  The total path length of this tornado was 17.5 miles.  Within Lumpkin county, the tornado tracked mostly through the Chattahoochee National Forest Region.  Thousands of trees were blown down or uprooted along the path of the tornado through the forest and adjacent areas.  Trees blocked parts of U.S. Highway 19/129 where it crossed for several hours.  A total of 14 homes suffered major damage in northern Lumpkin county from the tornado.  Four other structures sustained minor damage.   One injury was reported from one of the damaged homes, with no fatalities.||[04/27-04/28/11: Tornado #7, County #1-2, EF2, Lumpkin-White, 2011:016].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 750.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As it crossed County Road 450, it began downing numerous trees, pushed a mobile home over, and damaged the roof of a house. The tornado intensified as it cross MS Highway 491, destroying a large portion of two chicken houses down to the ground, and causing extensive tree damage. The tornado then appeared to weaken slightly as it crossed County Road 729 and then crossed into Kemper County near White Store Road. Numerous trees were snapped, and a home suffered some minor to moderate damage along County Road 729.||The tornado intensified as it approached Little Rock Road and MS Highway 495. The tornado reached an EF-3 intensity at this location, causing extensive structural damage to two frame homes, completely destroying two mobile homes and carrying the remains some distance, snapping several power poles, and causing intense tree damage with some denuded trees. The tornado weakened a bit from here, but continued to cause extensive tree damage and downed power poles and lines as it moved east-northeast. As the tornado crossed Highway 16 for the first time west of De Kalb, it continued to cause EF-2 type damage, destroying several mobile homes, heavily damaging the second story of a frame home, and causing roof damage to other frame homes. Extensive tree and power line damage also occurred in this area.||As the tornado crossed Neely Town Road north of DeKalb it again caused EF-3 type damage, completely destroying a double-wide mobile home and wrapping the frame around trees several hundred yards away and carrying the remnants across a road a considerable distance away, along with intense tree damage including denuded trees, and snapped power poles. It also destroyed another mobile home and caused roof damage to nearby frame homes. It continued east, causing extensive tree damage across MS Highway 39, and then caused EF-3 damage again as it crossed Old DeKalb-Scooba Road. Tree damage was the most impressive of anywhere along the track in this area, with large swaths of area where nearly every tree was snapped and many trees were denuded. Additionally, a frame home suffered heavy damage with the roof mainly gone and some walls heavily damaged, another home had heavy roof damage, and some outbuildings were destroyed. This was also where the tornado reached its maximum width of three-quarters of a mile.||The tornado then weakened somewhat and narrowed as it crossed MS Highway 16 west of Scooba. Numerous trees and a couple of power poles were snapped in this area. The tornado then crossed US Highway 45 south of Scooba where it was relatively narrow but intense with damage on the border of EF-2/EF-3. A large warehouse building was totally destroyed, a pickup truck was moved a considerable distance, intense tree damage occurred with some denuding, and three homes suffered roof damage.||After crossing US Highway 45, the tornado widened again, and caused heavy damage in the area east of Scooba, particularly along MS Highway 16 near Giles Road.

The tornado touched down near the intersection of Red Lion Road and Northeast Avenue. The roof of a car repair shop on Northeast Avenue caved in and injured two workers. One had to be hospitalized. An apartment complex near the garage was damaged and the Red Cross assisted four people in finding temporary quarters.  The roof of a beer distributor on Northeast Avenue collapsed. Torn shingles, signs and debris littered the grass around the distributor. A seafood restaurant on Bustelton Avenue then lost part of its roof.  The tornado then lifted. The path length was approximately two tenths of a mile and the maximum path width about 33 yards. The estimated maximum wind speed was 75 mph.

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado touched down a few miles south of the Stewart community, where it began uprooting and snapping off thousands of trees.

A grain silo received a huge dent from the tornado and an 18 wheeler was flipped over. Hundreds of trees were snapped and uprooted along the  path and numerous power poles were snapped. One injury was noted northwest of St. Joseph. Maximum winds were around 125 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Most of the damage in this area was limited to the overturning of trampolines, the knocking down of wooden privacy fences, an outdoor storage building, and minor shingle damage to the roof of two homes.  A (relatively empty) moving truck was also blown on its side in the subdivision.  The tornado strengthened as it approached an import/export business on the west side of US-281.  Here, an office building lost between 25% and 33% of the roof as the tornado continued moving westward.  Much of the roofing material landed on a car parked behind the office building, resulting in the injury of the driver.  In this area, a single-wide mobile home was heavily damaged, as well as a couple of semi trucks.  Before lifting, tornadic winds knocked down several hundred feet of concrete block fencing.

Overall, between 1 and 4 inches fell in the region.  Much of the rain was moderate, though heavier bands created pockets of urban flooding in Cameron County. ||A small but potent thunderstorm developed during the evening in very unstable air left behind by the outer bands, in extreme southern Hidalgo County.  Low level wind direction and speed shear were sufficient to create a rotating cell, which developed a quick but damaging tornado around 6 PM CDT.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This short-lived tornado touched down in a subdivision approximately 4 miles east-northeast of the city of Hidalgo in southern Hidalgo County.  Most of the damage in this area was limited to the overturning of trampolines, the knocking down of wooden privacy fences, an outdoor storage building, and minor shingle damage to the roof of two homes.  A (relatively empty) moving truck was also blown on its side in the subdivision.  The tornado strengthened as it approached an import/export business on the west side of US-281.  Here, an office building lost between 25% and 33% of the roof as the tornado continued moving westward.  Much of the roofing material landed on a car parked behind the office building, resulting in the injury of the driver.  In this area, a single-wide mobile home was heavily damaged, as well as a couple of semi trucks.  Before lifting, tornadic winds knocked down several hundred feet of concrete block fencing.  No damage was seen beyond this point by the National Weather Service survey crew or officials from the city of Pharr.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado touched down in northern Choctaw County and eventually tracked across multiple counties as it moved northeast.

Numerous mobile homes were severely damaged and several mobile homes were completely destroyed. Numerous barns and sheds received heavy damage or were destroyed.

Almost 150 homes and business' were significantly damaged or destroyed, many numerous others sustaining minor damage. Two fatalities occurred in a mobile home to the west of Tushka. Monetary damage estimates were not available, although it is thought they would be well into the millions of dollars.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado caused extensive damage to numerous roofs of homes and severe damage to several mobile homes. Numerous sheds and barns were heavily damaged. Thousands of trees were snapped or uprooted and several power poles were snapped. A gas station was severely damaged in the community of Sapa and the canopy was carried away. This tornado appears to be part of a family of tornadoes that hit the Choctaw/Webster counties area in association with the same storm.

The tornado began producing significant damage on the east side of Askewville, where numerous structures and several mobile homes sustained major damage or were destroyed. The tornado then tracked continuously for nearly 19 miles finally lifting east of Harrellsville. For much of the tornado's life, the path width was one half to nearly three quarters of a mile wide. EF2 and EF3 damage was widespread from just east of Askewville northeast to about 3 miles west of Colerain, then gradually decreased as the tornado crossed into Hertford county. Numerous homes were destroyed, and many others suffered varying degrees of damage. In addition, there was extensive damage to trees and wooded areas in the path of the tornado.

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City and the Cherokee County Emergency Management Director confirmed that a second and stronger EF3 tornado touched down approximately five miles northeast of Kingston, then tracked across extreme northwest Cherokee and into Pickens county, lifting seven miles west of Jasper.  This tornado was spawned by the same thunderstorm supercell that had earlier resulted in an EF2 tornado that tracked from Cherokee county, Alabama across northwest Polk, southern Floyd, and into western Bartow county before lifting approximately four miles southwest of Kingston.  The total path length of this tornado was 23 miles across the three Georgia counties.  Slightly over 15 miles of this path was within Bartow county.  The tornado had a maximum path width of 1/2 mile and maximum winds estimated to be 150 mph.  Extensive damage was observed across north central and northeast Bartow county to homes.  A total of 40 homes were destroyed with 240 others suffering minor damage.  Several chicken houses near Interstate-75 were destroyed as well as several outbuildings.  Damage was most extensive in the Crowe Springs Road area of Bartow county, approximately five miles northwest of White and north of Cassville.  Hundreds of trees and many power lines were also down along the tornado path.  Twenty-five injuries were observed in Bartow county, nearly all at the severely damaged or destroyed homes.  No fatalities were reported within Bartow county from either tornado.||[04/27-04/28/11: Tornado #6, County #1-3, EF3, Bartow-Cherokee-Pickens, 2011:015].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City confirmed that an EF3 tornado, which originated in DeKalb county, Alabama, continued on an east-northeast track into and across central Dade county, Georgia and further east-northeast into Walker county before lifting just west of Fort Oglethorpe.  The tornado path length within Dade county, Georgia was approximately 9.5 miles, while the path length within Georgia was 18 miles long.  The tornado was determined, within Georgia, to have a maximum path width of 0.6 mile and maximum winds of 150 mph.  The tornado tracked directly across the county seat of Dade county, namely Trenton.  Trenton is also the largest city in Dade county.  Portions of Trenton, especially the southern part of the city, were literally destroyed.  Dozens of homes were completely destroyed.  Eighteen more homes suffered major damage.  Literally tens of thousands of trees were blown down, uprooted, or splintered.  Some of the worst devastation was observed in the Black Valley Road area, including the Middleton Estates subdivision and along U.S. Highway 11 and Georgia Highway 136.  Considerable damage was also noted to apartments and several commercial buildings as well.  The Edgewood Townhouses and Village Green Apartments suffered extensive damage.  Among commercial structures sustaining damages were the Moore and Ryan Funeral Home along with an Ingles Grocery Store.  Two fatalities and 25 injuries occurred as a result of this tornado, mostly in Trenton.||[04/27-04/28/11:  Tornado #2, County #1-2, EF2, Dade-Walker, 2011:011].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City confirmed that an EF3 tornado, which originated in DeKalb county, Alabama, continued on an east-northeast track into and across central Dade county, Georgia and further east-northeast into Walker county before lifting just west of Fort Oglethorpe.  The tornado path length within Dade county, Georgia was approximately 9.5 miles, while the path length within Georgia was 18 miles long.  The tornado was determined, within Georgia, to have a maximum path width of 0.6 mile and maximum winds of 150 mph.  The tornado tracked directly across the county seat of Dade county, namely Trenton.  Trenton is also the largest city in Dade county.  Portions of Trenton, especially the southern part of the city, were literally destroyed.  Dozens of homes were completely destroyed.  Eighteen more homes suffered major damage.  Literally tens of thousands of trees were blown down, uprooted, or splintered.  Some of the worst devastation was observed in the Black Valley Road area, including the Middleton Estates subdivision and along U.S. Highway 11 and Georgia Highway 136.  Considerable damage was also noted to apartments and several commercial buildings as well.  The Edgewood Townhouses and Village Green Apartments suffered extensive damage.  Among commercial structures sustaining damages were the Moore and Ryan Funeral Home along with an Ingles Grocery Store.  Two fatalities and 25 injuries occurred as a result of this tornado, mostly in Trenton.||[04/27-04/28/11:  Tornado #2, County #1-2, EF2, Dade-Walker, 2011:011].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A summer-like Bermuda high pressure area was anchored off the southeast U.S. coast.  A stationary front extended across the lower Mississippi valley toward the mid-Atlantic with a cold front approaching from the west of this region from Texas toward the Great lakes.  The air mass across the region in advance of the stationary front was extremely moist, warm, and unstable for mid-December.  As an embedded strong short wave traversed the region in the southwest flow aloft, a period of strong shear and marginal instability translated across the region during the late afternoon and early evening.  These synoptic features supported a strong to severe quasi-linear convective system, or squall line, which moved across the state from west to east during the late afternoon and evening.  The line of thunderstorms spawned a half-a-dozen tornadoes causing extensive damage across several counties from west central into northwest and north central Georgia.  As the line moved east past Atlanta, it weakened considerably and no further severe weather was observed across east Georgia.  The six tornadoes occurring on this date tied the record for the most tornadoes ever occurring during December within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area in December, namely six in 2005.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia confirmed that the EF0 tornado, that initially touched down in extreme northeast Floyd county and continued across extreme northwest Bartow county, continued into Gordon county.  The tornado entered Gordon county about 2.8 miles east-southeast of Plainville before continuing on a northeastward track into central Gordon county, lifting and dissipating on the east side of Calhoun.  The tornado strengthened to an EF1 almost immediately after entering Gordon county, then to an EF3 as it approached the south side of Calhoun.  At its maximum intensity and size the tornado was determined to be 880 yards or 1/2 mile wide and had maximum winds of 150 mph.  The tornado tracked at least 10 miles through Gordon county.  As the tornado entered Gordon county, several homes along Emily Lane were damaged from falling trees just east of Plainville.  As the tornado strengthened to an EF3 near the corner of Boone Ford Road and Beason Road just south of Calhoun, were several additional homes were damaged and one was completely destroyed.  Numerous trees and power lines were also down along the path of the tornado through Gordon county, including several blocking Interstate-75 near the Bartow county line.  Four injuries were also reported from the destroyed home.||[12/22/11:  Tornado #2, County #3-3, EF3, Floyd-Bartow-Gordon, 2011:028].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A separate tornadic supercell produced an EF-3 tornado that moved into McDonald County from Northeastern Oklahoma. ||Continuing thunderstorms lasted into May 23 as another line of thunderstorms moved across the region. This line of storms produced reports of large hail, damaging winds and a weak EF-0 tornado in south central Missouri. As the storms moved over the Joplin area, two police officers were struck by lightning while aiding in the post tornado efforts. One of the two officers later died of injuries from the lightning strike.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A storm survey concluded that an EF-3 tornado crossed into McDonald County from adjacent Delaware County, Oklahoma.

Maximum winds were estimated to have exceeded 200 miles per hour. The tornado had a maximum width of one mile and an overall path length of nearly 21.6 miles, nearly nine miles of which occurred in Jasper County.||The tornado killed 158 directly, three indirectly, and injured over 1150 people.  Sadly, on May 24 a police officer who was volunteering from another department, was struck by lightning while serving in the response efforts and later died.  Equally, a 56 year old man who had been included as a direct fatality was later determined to have died of a heart attack.  Over 10,200 people filed for disaster assistance following the tornado.||The EF-5 rating (greater than 200 mph wind speeds) was mainly arrived at by the total destruction of vehicles, including some vehicles tossed several blocks and semi trucks thrown a quarter of a mile. Parking stops weighing over 300 pounds and re-barred into asphalt were uprooted and tossed.  Other factors in the rating included damage to reinforced concrete structures, and that St. John���s Hospital building structure was compromised.  ||Seven thousand homes were severely damaged or destroyed and another 900 damaged.  Other substantial buildings damaged or destroyed included the Joplin High School and Technical Center along with five other city schools.  Numerous retailers including Home Depot, Sports Academy, Dillons, and Walmart were also destroyed.  The most substantial building impacted was St John's hospital which will be razed due to the tornado.  It was calculated that 2 million cubic yards of debris is attributable to the storm across its relatively short length on the ground.||The tornado initially touched down one half mile southwest of the intersection of JJ Highway and Newton Road in Newton County where several large trees were toppled. ||The tornado rapidly intensified as it moved toward the intersection of Country Club Drive and 32nd Street where it crossed into Jasper County. Damage became more widespread as the tornado crossed Maiden Lane, breaking nearly all windows on three sides of St. Johns Hospital as well as damage to the roof and exterior walls on several floors.  Two patients on oxygen were indirectly suffocated when the generator and a backup generator were damaged after power was cut off.  Three additional patients may have succumbed similarly though sufficient data as to the cause of death was not available.  An additional indirect fatality occurred due to psychological trauma.||The tornado further intensified as it destroyed homes and businesses to the immediate east and north of the hospital. A church school was completely destroyed with the exception of a portion of the sanctuary.  Significant damage to the Greenbriar Nursing Home resulted in the death of 20 mostly elderly patients.  ||The tornado continued to destroy hundreds of frame homes between 32nd and 20th Streets, leading to nearly a fifth of the deaths. Three story apartment complexes had the top two floors removed; other two story complexes were partially leveled. Fourteen deaths occurred in apartments along the track.  Eleven additional deaths occurred in churches along this path.  There were two fatalities in a mobile home (Joplin has a city ordinance prohibiting mobile home parks). ||Well built structures that were heavily damaged or destroyed along this area included the Joplin High School, Franklin Technical Center and Irving Elementary, all of which were free of students due to the weekend.  The tornado also damaged three additional elementary schools.  A bank was totally destroyed with the exception of the vault. A large grocery store was also destroyed.  ||The tornado crossed Rangeline Road near 20th Street. Damage included significant to complete damage to several restaurants and large long-span retail buildings; including Home Depot, Sports Academy and Walmart in this area.

A summer-like Bermuda high pressure area was anchored off the southeast U.S. coast.  A stationary front extended across the lower Mississippi valley toward the mid-Atlantic with a cold front approaching from the west of this region from Texas toward the Great lakes.  The air mass across the region in advance of the stationary front was extremely moist, warm, and unstable for mid-December.  As an embedded strong short wave traversed the region in the southwest flow aloft, a period of strong shear and marginal instability translated across the region during the late afternoon and early evening.  These synoptic features supported a strong to severe quasi-linear convective system, or squall line, which moved across the state from west to east during the late afternoon and evening.  The line of thunderstorms spawned a half-a-dozen tornadoes causing extensive damage across several counties from west central into northwest and north central Georgia.  As the line moved east past Atlanta, it weakened considerably and no further severe weather was observed across east Georgia.  The six tornadoes occurring on this date tied the record for the most tornadoes ever occurring during December within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area in December, namely six in 2005.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia, confirmed that an EF2 tornado, the first of six tornadoes to affect west Georgia on this day, touched down approximately three miles west-southwest of Rome, then continued on a northeastward track approximately 12 miles before lifting about 7 1/4 miles north-northeast of Rome.  The tornado was determined to have a maximum path width of 200 yards with maximum winds estimated to be 125 mph.  As the tornado first touched down just west of Rome, it was classified as an EF1 but strengthened to an EF2 as it moved toward the community of Walton Creek.  The tornado remained at an EF2 intensity for approximately 1 1/2 miles as it crossed Georgia Highway 20.  The tornado eventually lifted and dissipated just west of Georgia Highway 53, just north of Jones Bend Road.  At least 20 homes along the path of the tornado sustained significant damage.  Many trees and several power lines were also damage or destroyed by the tornado.  In addition, three minor injuries were reported at one of the damaged homes.  Numerous trees and power lines were down along the path of the tornado as well, including along Georgia Highway 27, Division Street, Shorter Avenue, Edmond Road, and Elm Street.  Some traffic signals were also blown down.||[12/22/11:  Tornado #1, County #1-1, EF2, Floyd, 2011:027].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.25M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A summer-like Bermuda high pressure area was anchored off the southeast U.S. coast.  A stationary front extended across the lower Mississippi valley toward the mid-Atlantic with a cold front approaching from the west of this region from Texas toward the Great lakes.  The air mass across the region in advance of the stationary front was extremely moist, warm, and unstable for mid-December.  As an embedded strong short wave traversed the region in the southwest flow aloft, a period of strong shear and marginal instability translated across the region during the late afternoon and early evening.  These synoptic features supported a strong to severe quasi-linear convective system, or squall line, which moved across the state from west to east during the late afternoon and evening.  The line of thunderstorms spawned a half-a-dozen tornadoes causing extensive damage across several counties from west central into northwest and north central Georgia.  As the line moved east past Atlanta, it weakened considerably and no further severe weather was observed across east Georgia.  The six tornadoes occurring on this date tied the record for the most tornadoes ever occurring during December within the Peachtree City, Georgia county warning area in December, namely six in 2005.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia, confirmed that an EF2 tornado, the first of six tornadoes to affect west Georgia on this day, touched down approximately three miles west-southwest of Rome, then continued on a northeastward track approximately 12 miles before lifting about 7 1/4 miles north-northeast of Rome.  The tornado was determined to have a maximum path width of 200 yards with maximum winds estimated to be 125 mph.  As the tornado first touched down just west of Rome, it was classified as an EF1 but strengthened to an EF2 as it moved toward the community of Walton Creek.  The tornado remained at an EF2 intensity for approximately 1 1/2 miles as it crossed Georgia Highway 20.  The tornado eventually lifted and dissipated just west of Georgia Highway 53, just north of Jones Bend Road.  At least 20 homes along the path of the tornado sustained significant damage.  Many trees and several power lines were also damage or destroyed by the tornado.  In addition, three minor injuries were reported at one of the damaged homes.  Numerous trees and power lines were down along the path of the tornado as well, including along Georgia Highway 27, Division Street, Shorter Avenue, Edmond Road, and Elm Street.  Some traffic signals were also blown down.||[12/22/11:  Tornado #1, County #1-1, EF2, Floyd, 2011:027].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.25M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This epic event broke the record for number of tornadoes in a day for the state of Alabama, becoming the most significant tornado outbreak in the state���s history. ||Central Alabama had two rounds of severe weather that day. During the early morning hours, a Quasi-Linear Convective System quickly moved across the northern half of the National Weather Service, Birmingham county warning area. Straight line winds of 90 mph (78kts) or greater and 11 tornadoes lead to widespread damage and power outages. During the afternoon, long-lived supercell thunderstorms produced long-track, strong and violent tornadoes. Destruction and loss of life across many towns and communities was devastating. ||The hardest hit areas included Shottsville and Hackleburg, both in Marion County, where winds of 160 mph and 210 mph respectively, caused unimagineable damage. Cordova, in Walker County, was hit twice; by a tornado along the Quasi-Linear Convective System during the early morning hours and again in the afternoon by a long-track EF4 tornado. A long track tornado moved across the city of Tuscaloosa and the western suburbs of Birmingham, resulting in the complete destruction of whole neighborhoods and numerous injuries and fatalities in those heavily populated areas. The same parent supercell produced another violent tornado in east Central Alabama as it tracked across St. Clair and Calhoun Counties, resulting in additional fatalities and incredible damage to a number of neighborhoods. Another violent EF4 tornado tracked across portions of Elmore and Tallapoosa Counties, including Lake Martin, destroying numerous homes and a large section of a mobile home park. ||Most of the violent tornadoes from this day were captured on video by a number of people, including storm spotters and chasers, as well as numerous television news crews and remotely controlled web-enabled video cameras.  This allowed unprecedented coverage and viewing of this historic event in real time from people worldwide.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado initially touched down in eastern Jefferson County, north northeast of Trussville and moved northeast through portions of St. Clair, Calhoun, Etowah and Cherokee Counties, before it moved into Georgia, across Polk, Floyd and Bartow (See Storm Data Peachtree City) Counties. The tornado crossed Neely Henry Lake and into Calhoun County at Eagle Cove Rd., northwest of Ohatchee. At this point, the tornado had winds of 180 mph, an EF4 rating, and a path width of 1 mile. As the tornado crossed AL Hwy 77, numerous homes were leveled and mobile homes were demolished. Trees were left as stumps. Four fatalities occurred in this area. The tornado continued to cause extensive damage as it moved northeast crossing US Hwy 431 at Colwell and CR 23, where several homes and one church were destroyed. Four fatalities occurred in this area. As the tornado approached the Etowah County line, it weakened to an EF2 with winds of 120 mph, but continued to cause damage. Several homes were damaged and one mobile home destroyed along CR 64. The tornado moved into Etowah County east of Cannonball Rd. ||This tornado was produced by a supercell thunderstorm that began in Newton County Mississippi at 13:54 pm CST, and dissipated in Macon County, North Carolina at approximately 21:18 pm CST. This supercell spawned several strong to violent tornadoes along its long path, which included another violent EF4 tornado that crossed portions of Tuscaloosa and western suburbs of the Birmingham.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 122.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado continued to cause extensive damage as it moved northeast crossing US Hwy 431 at Colwell and CR 23, where several homes and one church were destroyed. Four fatalities occurred in this area. As the tornado approached the Etowah County line, it weakened to an EF2 with winds of 120 mph, but continued to cause damage. Several homes were damaged and one mobile home destroyed along CR 64. The tornado moved into Etowah County east of Cannonball Rd. ||This tornado was produced by a supercell thunderstorm that began in Newton County Mississippi at 13:54 pm CST, and dissipated in Macon County, North Carolina at approximately 21:18 pm CST.

As the tornado moved into Blount County near Sibleyville Rd, it intensified to an EF2 rating with winds of 135 mph. An outbuilding was destroyed and many trees downed near the county line. The tornado continued northeast, before making a slight eastward turn and moving along the western edge of Mountain Woods Lake. Along the lake, twenty to twenty-five homes were damaged with at least 3 homes destroyed. Three injuries occurred while a family was sheltered in their home, which was destroyed. In addition, multiple boat docks and garages were damaged or destroyed. Along the portion of the path in Blount County, hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado weakened to an EF0 as it approached Corridor X/future Interstate 22, with only minor tree damage noted, before it strengthened significantly as it neared Cordova. A 0.6 mile wide swath of EF3 damage, with winds of 140 mph, was noted in downtown Cordova. Numerous homes and buildings sustained significant damage, if not complete destruction, resulting in 4 fatalities. The tornado continued northeastward across Burton Chapel Loop Road and crossed the Mulberry Fork of the Black Warrior River. As it crossed Mountain View Road, the tornado increased to a violent EF4 rating, with winds of 170 mph, and destroyed 2 mobile homes, as well as a single family home. One of the mobile home undercarriages was missing, having been tossed at least 500 yards. At this site, a small bulldozer was flipped over, a pickup truck was tossed 200 yards, and an International 4700 dump truck was tossed 50 yards and was destroyed upon landing. A 2 ton utility trailer from this location was found a mile away, with a 2.5 ft impact crater where it landed. As the tornado neared Old Hwy 78, it tossed two double wide mobile homes at least 100 yards, resulting in their complete destruction. Two fatalities occurred here. The tornado continued toward Sipsey, where an unanchored double wide mobile home was tossed 100 feet up a 50 foot embankment. Two fatalities occurred in this area.

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado started by downing some trees just southeast of Raleigh, near and across Highway 18. As the tornado moved northeast along Bailey Road and crossed County Road 130, it intensified and produced high end EF-1 damage, snapping and uprooting trees, taking shingles off roofs, and blowing skirting out from mobile homes. The tornado continued to strengthen as it moved northeast, and along County Roads 136, 107, and 105, it produced damage indicative of high end EF-2. A few mobile homes were destroyed and several homes and buildings sustained significant roof damage, along with extensive tree damage. Along County Road 105, a mobile home was picked up by the tornado, bounced along the ground a couple of times, and was then thrown into woods across the road, with debris scattered for at least a mile downstream, including the frame of the mobile home. The occupant of the mobile home was the first fatality of this tornado. The tornado continued northeast, and reached its most intense and widest point in the Smith County portion of the tornado just before crossing the county line at County Road 103. Here, in the central core of the tornado there was an area of completely mowed down pine trees in which everyone was snapped and many were denuded, and two frame homes had the roofs and exterior walls completely destroyed with extensive damage to interior walls. In addition, many power poles were snapped, a mobile home was annihilated, and a large shop building was completely destroyed. The damage here was rated high end EF-3 with maximum estimated winds of 160 mph.||The tornado remained intense as it crossed into Jasper County and moved across County Road 13, causing very impressive tree damage with nearly every pine tree snapped and extensive evidence of denuding and debarking. Power poles were also snapped. The tornado produced similar type damage as it crossed County Road 16. The tornado then produced its first area of EF-4 damage just northwest of Louin along County Road 164. Here, the tornado struck an area with several mobile homes and one frame home. The frame home was completely destroyed, with most interior walls down and some of the foundation pushed clean. Several mobile homes in the area, including two double wides which the residents said were well strapped down, were completely destroyed with the debris and frames blown great distances. In fact, all of the debris was so dispersed and mixed that it was impossible for the surveyors to reconstruct the positions of the mobile homes and house without explanations from the residents. Two people were killed in a mobile home at this spot; however, several other people abandoned their mobile homes after hearing warnings to shelter in a nearby brick home, and were certainly saved from serious injury or death. ||After crossing Highway 15, the tornado weakened and narrowed somewhat. As it crossed County Road 23, it produced EF-2 damage, destroying two mobile homes and causing extensive tree and powerline damage. The tornado then produced a relatively narrow path of EF-1 tree and powerline damage for several miles, until reintensifying near Rose Hill. As the tornado crossed Highway 18 southeast of Rose Hill, it removed most of the roof of a frame home and caused heavy damage to the exterior walls, took a large section of roof off another frame home, completely destroyed a large tied down mobile home, and caused extensive tree damage. This damage was rated at the low end of EF-3. After causing this damage, the tornado weakened again, causing mainly EF-1 type tree damage until it reached the Clarke County line, with the last point inside the county line on County Road 22 rated as EF-0, with just a few trees and limbs down. ||The tornado then continued into Clarke County and reintensified somewhat, causing tree and powerline damage as it crossed Interstate 59 and US Highway 11. The tornado then became much more intense as it moved along the south side of the town of Enterprise. A number of homes and mobile homes were heavily damaged or destroyed along County Road 320 and State Highway 513. This damage was rated as high EF-2 to low end EF-3. As the tornado passed along a two mile stretch of State Highway 519 east of Enterprise, it heavily damaged several frame homes and caused extensive tree damage. One spot here was the other area of EF-4 damage produced by this tornado. A new construction frame home was completely leveled with the debris swept off the foundation. Residents in the area reported that the house was nearly completed. Based on these reports and the extent of other nearby, primarily tree, damage, this damage is being rated EF-4 with maximum winds of 175 mph. Other damage in this general area was rated as high end EF-2 or low end EF-3. ||The tornado weakened slightly again as it crossed US Highway 45 and State Highway 145, and then caused high end EF-2 and low end EF-3 damage at County Roads 456 and 457. Here, several strapped down double wide mobile homes were destroyed with debris strewn over long distances. Nearby residents reported that one of the mobile homes was occupied by 11 persons at the time of the tornado, and that this was the location where 4 people were killed. Another resident of a nearby mobile home was critically injured. From here, the tornado passed east northeast, just north of the Energy and Snell communities, causing EF-2 damage to a number of frame homes along with extensive tree and powerline damage. The tornado crossed Highway 514 northeast of Snell, still causing extensive tree damage and significant roof damage to several large frame homes, before moving across the state line into Choctaw County, Alabama. The tornado continued into Alabama for 59 miles, bringing the total path length to 124 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 900.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado started by downing some trees just southeast of Raleigh, near and across Highway 18. As the tornado moved northeast along Bailey Road and crossed County Road 130, it intensified and produced high end EF-1 damage, snapping and uprooting trees, taking shingles off roofs, and blowing skirting out from mobile homes. The tornado continued to strengthen as it moved northeast, and along County Roads 136, 107, and 105, it produced damage indicative of high end EF-2. A few mobile homes were destroyed and several homes and buildings sustained significant roof damage, along with extensive tree damage. Along County Road 105, a mobile home was picked up by the tornado, bounced along the ground a couple of times, and was then thrown into woods across the road, with debris scattered for at least a mile downstream, including the frame of the mobile home. The occupant of the mobile home was the first fatality of this tornado. The tornado continued northeast, and reached its most intense and widest point in the Smith County portion of the tornado just before crossing the county line at County Road 103. Here, in the central core of the tornado there was an area of completely mowed down pine trees in which everyone was snapped and many were denuded, and two frame homes had the roofs and exterior walls completely destroyed with extensive damage to interior walls. In addition, many power poles were snapped, a mobile home was annihilated, and a large shop building was completely destroyed. The damage here was rated high end EF-3 with maximum estimated winds of 160 mph.||The tornado remained intense as it crossed into Jasper County and moved across County Road 13, causing very impressive tree damage with nearly every pine tree snapped and extensive evidence of denuding and debarking. Power poles were also snapped. The tornado produced similar type damage as it crossed County Road 16. The tornado then produced its first area of EF-4 damage just northwest of Louin along County Road 164. Here, the tornado struck an area with several mobile homes and one frame home. The frame home was completely destroyed, with most interior walls down and some of the foundation pushed clean. Several mobile homes in the area, including two double wides which the residents said were well strapped down, were completely destroyed with the debris and frames blown great distances. In fact, all of the debris was so dispersed and mixed that it was impossible for the surveyors to reconstruct the positions of the mobile homes and house without explanations from the residents. Two people were killed in a mobile home at this spot; however, several other people abandoned their mobile homes after hearing warnings to shelter in a nearby brick home, and were certainly saved from serious injury or death. ||After crossing Highway 15, the tornado weakened and narrowed somewhat. As it crossed County Road 23, it produced EF-2 damage, destroying two mobile homes and causing extensive tree and powerline damage. The tornado then produced a relatively narrow path of EF-1 tree and powerline damage for several miles, until reintensifying near Rose Hill. As the tornado crossed Highway 18 southeast of Rose Hill, it removed most of the roof of a frame home and caused heavy damage to the exterior walls, took a large section of roof off another frame home, completely destroyed a large tied down mobile home, and caused extensive tree damage. This damage was rated at the low end of EF-3. After causing this damage, the tornado weakened again, causing mainly EF-1 type tree damage until it reached the Clarke County line, with the last point inside the county line on County Road 22 rated as EF-0, with just a few trees and limbs down. ||The tornado then continued into Clarke County and reintensified somewhat, causing tree and powerline damage as it crossed Interstate 59 and US Highway 11. The tornado then became much more intense as it moved along the south side of the town of Enterprise. A number of homes and mobile homes were heavily damaged or destroyed along County Road 320 and State Highway 513. This damage was rated as high EF-2 to low end EF-3. As the tornado passed along a two mile stretch of State Highway 519 east of Enterprise, it heavily damaged several frame homes and caused extensive tree damage. One spot here was the other area of EF-4 damage produced by this tornado. A new construction frame home was completely leveled with the debris swept off the foundation. Residents in the area reported that the house was nearly completed. Based on these reports and the extent of other nearby, primarily tree, damage, this damage is being rated EF-4 with maximum winds of 175 mph. Other damage in this general area was rated as high end EF-2 or low end EF-3. ||The tornado weakened slightly again as it crossed US Highway 45 and State Highway 145, and then caused high end EF-2 and low end EF-3 damage at County Roads 456 and 457. Here, several strapped down double wide mobile homes were destroyed with debris strewn over long distances. Nearby residents reported that one of the mobile homes was occupied by 11 persons at the time of the tornado, and that this was the location where 4 people were killed. Another resident of a nearby mobile home was critically injured. From here, the tornado passed east northeast, just north of the Energy and Snell communities, causing EF-2 damage to a number of frame homes along with extensive tree and powerline damage. The tornado crossed Highway 514 northeast of Snell, still causing extensive tree damage and significant roof damage to several large frame homes, before moving across the state line into Choctaw County, Alabama.

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado started by downing some trees just southeast of Raleigh, near and across Highway 18. As the tornado moved northeast along Bailey Road and crossed County Road 130, it intensified and produced high end EF-1 damage, snapping and uprooting trees, taking shingles off roofs, and blowing skirting out from mobile homes. The tornado continued to strengthen as it moved northeast, and along County Roads 136, 107, and 105, it produced damage indicative of high end EF-2. A few mobile homes were destroyed and several homes and buildings sustained significant roof damage, along with extensive tree damage. Along County Road 105, a mobile home was picked up by the tornado, bounced along the ground a couple of times, and was then thrown into woods across the road, with debris scattered for at least a mile downstream, including the frame of the mobile home. The occupant of the mobile home was the first fatality of this tornado. The tornado continued northeast, and reached its most intense and widest point in the Smith County portion of the tornado just before crossing the county line at County Road 103. Here, in the central core of the tornado there was an area of completely mowed down pine trees in which everyone was snapped and many were denuded, and two frame homes had the roofs and exterior walls completely destroyed with extensive damage to interior walls. In addition, many power poles were snapped, a mobile home was annihilated, and a large shop building was completely destroyed. The damage here was rated high end EF-3 with maximum estimated winds of 160 mph.||The tornado remained intense as it crossed into Jasper County and moved across County Road 13, causing very impressive tree damage with nearly every pine tree snapped and extensive evidence of denuding and debarking. Power poles were also snapped. The tornado produced similar type damage as it crossed County Road 16. The tornado then produced its first area of EF-4 damage just northwest of Louin along County Road 164. Here, the tornado struck an area with several mobile homes and one frame home. The frame home was completely destroyed, with most interior walls down and some of the foundation pushed clean. Several mobile homes in the area, including two double wides which the residents said were well strapped down, were completely destroyed with the debris and frames blown great distances. In fact, all of the debris was so dispersed and mixed that it was impossible for the surveyors to reconstruct the positions of the mobile homes and house without explanations from the residents. Two people were killed in a mobile home at this spot; however, several other people abandoned their mobile homes after hearing warnings to shelter in a nearby brick home, and were certainly saved from serious injury or death. ||After crossing Highway 15, the tornado weakened and narrowed somewhat. As it crossed County Road 23, it produced EF-2 damage, destroying two mobile homes and causing extensive tree and powerline damage. The tornado then produced a relatively narrow path of EF-1 tree and powerline damage for several miles, until reintensifying near Rose Hill. As the tornado crossed Highway 18 southeast of Rose Hill, it removed most of the roof of a frame home and caused heavy damage to the exterior walls, took a large section of roof off another frame home, completely destroyed a large tied down mobile home, and caused extensive tree damage. This damage was rated at the low end of EF-3. After causing this damage, the tornado weakened again, causing mainly EF-1 type tree damage until it reached the Clarke County line, with the last point inside the county line on County Road 22 rated as EF-0, with just a few trees and limbs down. ||The tornado then continued into Clarke County and reintensified somewhat, causing tree and powerline damage as it crossed Interstate 59 and US Highway 11. The tornado then became much more intense as it moved along the south side of the town of Enterprise. A number of homes and mobile homes were heavily damaged or destroyed along County Road 320 and State Highway 513. This damage was rated as high EF-2 to low end EF-3. As the tornado passed along a two mile stretch of State Highway 519 east of Enterprise, it heavily damaged several frame homes and caused extensive tree damage. One spot here was the other area of EF-4 damage produced by this tornado. A new construction frame home was completely leveled with the debris swept off the foundation. Residents in the area reported that the house was nearly completed. Based on these reports and the extent of other nearby, primarily tree, damage, this damage is being rated EF-4 with maximum winds of 175 mph. Other damage in this general area was rated as high end EF-2 or low end EF-3. ||The tornado weakened slightly again as it crossed US Highway 45 and State Highway 145, and then caused high end EF-2 and low end EF-3 damage at County Roads 456 and 457. Here, several strapped down double wide mobile homes were destroyed with debris strewn over long distances. Nearby residents reported that one of the mobile homes was occupied by 11 persons at the time of the tornado, and that this was the location where 4 people were killed. Another resident of a nearby mobile home was critically injured. From here, the tornado passed east northeast, just north of the Energy and Snell communities, causing EF-2 damage to a number of frame homes along with extensive tree and powerline damage. The tornado crossed Highway 514 northeast of Snell, still causing extensive tree damage and significant roof damage to several large frame homes, before moving across the state line into Choctaw County, Alabama.

This epic event broke the record for number of tornadoes in a day for the state of Alabama, becoming the most significant tornado outbreak in the state���s history. ||Central Alabama had two rounds of severe weather that day. During the early morning hours, a Quasi-Linear Convective System quickly moved across the northern half of the National Weather Service, Birmingham county warning area. Straight line winds of 90 mph (78kts) or greater and 11 tornadoes lead to widespread damage and power outages. During the afternoon, long-lived supercell thunderstorms produced long-track, strong and violent tornadoes. Destruction and loss of life across many towns and communities was devastating. ||The hardest hit areas included Shottsville and Hackleburg, both in Marion County, where winds of 160 mph and 210 mph respectively, caused unimagineable damage. Cordova, in Walker County, was hit twice; by a tornado along the Quasi-Linear Convective System during the early morning hours and again in the afternoon by a long-track EF4 tornado. A long track tornado moved across the city of Tuscaloosa and the western suburbs of Birmingham, resulting in the complete destruction of whole neighborhoods and numerous injuries and fatalities in those heavily populated areas. The same parent supercell produced another violent tornado in east Central Alabama as it tracked across St. Clair and Calhoun Counties, resulting in additional fatalities and incredible damage to a number of neighborhoods. Another violent EF4 tornado tracked across portions of Elmore and Tallapoosa Counties, including Lake Martin, destroying numerous homes and a large section of a mobile home park. ||Most of the violent tornadoes from this day were captured on video by a number of people, including storm spotters and chasers, as well as numerous television news crews and remotely controlled web-enabled video cameras.  This allowed unprecedented coverage and viewing of this historic event in real time from people worldwide.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado initially touched down in eastern Jefferson County, north northeast of Trussville and moved northeast through portions of St. Clair, Calhoun, Etowah and Cherokee Counties. The tornado then moved into Georgia, across Polk, Floyd and Bartow (See Storm Data Peachtree City) Counties.  The tornado moved into southwestern Cherokee County south of Estes Crossroads, along CR 19. As the tornado continued northeast, it strengthened as it moved south of Gnatville, to an EF2 rating with winds of 120 mph. Extensive tree damage was noted along CR 6 and several mobile homes sustained significant damage off of CR 447. The tornado strengthened further to an EF3 rating with winds of 150 mph as it crossed AL Hwy 9 south of Coloma. A single family home was destroyed on CR 31. The tornado weakened slightly as it crossed Frog Mountain, but continued to knock down trees and damage an outbuilding. The tornado re-strengthened as it crossed CR 45 north of Rock Run.

The tornado then moved into Georgia, across Polk, Floyd and Bartow (See Storm Data Peachtree City) Counties.  The tornado moved into southwestern Cherokee County south of Estes Crossroads, along CR 19. As the tornado continued northeast, it strengthened as it moved south of Gnatville, to an EF2 rating with winds of 120 mph. Extensive tree damage was noted along CR 6 and several mobile homes sustained significant damage off of CR 447. The tornado strengthened further to an EF3 rating with winds of 150 mph as it crossed AL Hwy 9 south of Coloma. A single family home was destroyed on CR 31. The tornado weakened slightly as it crossed Frog Mountain, but continued to knock down trees and damage an outbuilding. The tornado re-strengthened as it crossed CR 45 north of Rock Run.

This tornado began in Pickens County, 5 miles northeast of Pickensville, and tracked through Tuscaloosa, Fayette, Walker, Cullman (See Storm Data for Huntsville), and Blount Counties, before it dissipated in Marshall (See Storm Data for Huntsville) County. While the average path width of this tornado in this portion of Fayette County was around 0.5 mile (880 yds), the tornado maximum path width was 0.75 mile (1320 yds) as it entered the county. The tornado strengthened to an EF3 rating, with winds of 140 mph, as it crossed CR 83 in Fayette County, where a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the remaining debris thrown a considerable distance, which resulted in 2 fatalities. The tornado continued northeast, where it crossed Wilcutt Road and CR 46, where several additional mobile homes were completely destroyed and the debris thrown a considerable distance. This resulted in two additional fatalities. Along this path, two homes sustained complete roof loss or partial roof loss, respectively. In addition, several cars were thrown and destroyed, and a building sustained extensive damage to the exterior brick veneer. The tornado caused considerable damage to trees, completely debarked trees with only stubs of largest branches as it continued northeast toward the Walker County line.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 6.60M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia confirmed that the EF3 tornado that first touched down in northeast Meriwether county around 1155 pm EDT continued into western Spalding county.  The tornado entered Spalding county approximately three miles south of Digbey, then continued northeast across the communities of Vaughn, Birdie, and Sunny Side before moving into southern Henry county and then lifting just across the Henry county line, approximately two miles south of Hampton.  Approximately 15.6 miles of the near 20-mile long path of this EF3 tornado were within Spalding county.  The total path length of the tornado within Spalding county was approximately 15.6 miles.  The path width remained at 1/2 mile wide with maximum winds estimated to be 140 mph.  Two fatalities were recorded in Spalding county in the southwest part of the county, southwest of Vaughn, as a result of this tornado.  These deaths occurred when a mobile home was overturned and destroyed.  Within Spalding county there were 400 structures affected including 45 homes and/or businesses destroyed, 280 with major damage, and 75 with minor damage.  Thousands of trees and dozens of power lines were down along the entire path of the tornado.  The tornado crossed both Georgia Highway 16, Georgia Highway 92, and U.S. Highway 19/41 on its path across the county.  Along Georgia Highway 92, just one mile east of the Flint River and the Fayette county line, trees were completely flattened within a 1/4 mile wide area on both sides of the road.  Several commercial businesses were destroyed at the intersection of U.S. Highway 19/41 and School Road, just south of the Henry county line.||[04/27-04/28/11: Tornado #11, County #2-3, EF3, Meriwether-Spalding-Henry, 2011:020].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Within Spalding county there were 400 structures affected including 45 homes and/or businesses destroyed, 280 with major damage, and 75 with minor damage.  Thousands of trees and dozens of power lines were down along the entire path of the tornado.  The tornado crossed both Georgia Highway 16, Georgia Highway 92, and U.S. Highway 19/41 on its path across the county.  Along Georgia Highway 92, just one mile east of the Flint River and the Fayette county line, trees were completely flattened within a 1/4 mile wide area on both sides of the road.  Several commercial businesses were destroyed at the intersection of U.S. Highway 19/41 and School Road, just south of the Henry county line.||[04/27-04/28/11: Tornado #11, County #2-3, EF3, Meriwether-Spalding-Henry, 2011:020].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5.

The most intense damage was around Mitchell Lane/Mitchell Road where one wood framed home was pushed off the foundation and destroyed. Another wood framed home was pushed off the foundation. Three to four mobile homes were heavily damaged as they were pushed off their foundations. In Hinds County, a well built home had a large section of the roof removed and carport was blown apart.

Damage was widespread and severe with several well built multi-story homes destroyed with no walls remaining on floors above basement level. The tornado continued at this strength but became narrower to nearly 400 yards wide as it crossed AL Hwy 49 south of Dadeville where it destroyed 2 homes and rolled a pick-up truck 120 yards. The tornado continued northeast and weakened to EF3 strength with winds of 155 mph.

This epic event broke the record for number of tornadoes in a day for the state of Alabama, becoming the most significant tornado outbreak in the state���s history. ||Central Alabama had two rounds of severe weather that day. During the early morning hours, a Quasi-Linear Convective System quickly moved across the northern half of the National Weather Service, Birmingham county warning area. Straight line winds of 90 mph (78kts) or greater and 11 tornadoes lead to widespread damage and power outages. During the afternoon, long-lived supercell thunderstorms produced long-track, strong and violent tornadoes.

Cordova, in Walker County, was hit twice; by a tornado along the Quasi-Linear Convective System during the early morning hours and again in the afternoon by a long-track EF4 tornado. A long track tornado moved across the city of Tuscaloosa and the western suburbs of Birmingham, resulting in the complete destruction of whole neighborhoods and numerous injuries and fatalities in those heavily populated areas. The same parent supercell produced another violent tornado in east Central Alabama as it tracked across St. Clair and Calhoun Counties, resulting in additional fatalities and incredible damage to a number of neighborhoods. Another violent EF4 tornado tracked across portions of Elmore and Tallapoosa Counties, including Lake Martin, destroying numerous homes and a large section of a mobile home park. ||Most of the violent tornadoes from this day were captured on video by a number of people, including storm spotters and chasers, as well as numerous television news crews and remotely controlled web-enabled video cameras.

The tornado moved north northeast through Cordova before lifting near Lynns Park. The tornado touched down southwest of CR 6 and rapidly intensified to an EF3 rating with winds of 140 mph. Along Horseshoe Bend, a home was completely leveled, where it swept the foundation clean of the structure and debris. The tornado continued north northeast through the Richardson subdivision and across Pleasantville Road. It destroyed at least two single-wide manufactured homes. The tornado crossed US Hwy 269 where it weakened to an EF2 with winds of 120 mph and moved through the Aldridge community, where several homes were damaged, large trees were uprooted, and another single-wide manufactured home was tossed and obliterated. In Cordova, the tornado caused significant roof and parapet damage to brick buildings in the downtown area. The tornado crossed Old US Hwy 78 just east of the Mulberry Fork, where it snapped and uprooted trees and caused minor structural damage. The tornado continued northeast and dissipated south of County Road 22, less than a mile north of Old US Hwy 78. A second tornado, with winds of 140 mph, tracked through Cordova during the afternoon of the same day (between 1535 and 1605 CST) and caused more significant structural damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 13.40M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As it did, it caused a warm front to lift into eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.  Temperatures south of the front were in the 80s with dew point temperatures in the 60s.  Meanwhile, readings north of the boundary were in the 50s and 60s.  Moderate instability south of the front combined with high levels of wind shear allowed for supercell development over eastern Nebraska and southwest Iowa during the late afternoon and early evening of April 9th.  A few of the storms that were near the front turned tornadic while the other supercells were prolific hail producers, in some cases producing very large hail.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado caused extensive damage in the Mapleton area with about 100 houses destroyed and many others severely damaged in a 12 to 15 block area on the southwest side of town.  This caused the displacement of around 500 to 600 people.  Most garages and stand alone structures were destroyed.  In addition, large trees were uprooted and windows blown out of vehicles.  Twelve to 14 people sustained minor injuries, the most severe a broken leg.  The worst property damage was noted to be on the lower end of the EF3 category.  The tornado started about 2 miles west southwest of Mapleton, moved into town, then turned north and ended 1 mile north of town.  The path length was around 3.5 miles and the maximum width was around 3/4 of a mile.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As it did, it caused a warm front to lift into eastern Nebraska and western Iowa.  Temperatures south of the front were in the 80s with dew point temperatures in the 60s.  Meanwhile, readings north of the boundary were in the 50s and 60s.  Moderate instability south of the front combined with high levels of wind shear allowed for supercell development over eastern Nebraska and southwest Iowa during the late afternoon and early evening of April 9th.  A few of the storms that were near the front turned tornadic while the other supercells were prolific hail producers, in some cases producing very large hail.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado caused extensive damage in the Mapleton area with about 100 houses destroyed and many others severely damaged in a 12 to 15 block area on the southwest side of town.  This caused the displacement of around 500 to 600 people.  Most garages and stand alone structures were destroyed.  In addition, large trees were uprooted and windows blown out of vehicles.  Twelve to 14 people sustained minor injuries, the most severe a broken leg.  The worst property damage was noted to be on the lower end of the EF3 category.  The tornado started about 2 miles west southwest of Mapleton, moved into town, then turned north and ended 1 mile north of town.  The path length was around 3.5 miles and the maximum width was around 3/4 of a mile.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This occurred during the late few days of August.  The system slowly intensified under weak steering currents and moved onshore the Louisiana coast on the 3rd.  Tropical Storm Lee was extremely slow moving at this point and consequently dumped excessive rainfall across southeast Louisiana.  A sharp upper trough began to take shape in the central U.S. on September 4th as upper energy dug southeast from Canada.  As this occurred, the remnants of Lee began to accelerate northeastward in association with the advancing upper trough.  The remnants of Lee traveled very quickly along the advancing front, racing across Georgia on the 5th.  Rain bands began to affect the area late on the 4th, but most of these were light to moderate.  On the 5th, persistent heavy rain impacted northwest Georgia and resulted in minor flooding.  Despite widespread rainfall of four to five inches across northwest Georgia with localized six to eight inches, the ongoing drought across the state resulted in minimal impacts of the heavy rain on the area,  The bigger problems came during the afternoon of the 5th when an area of strong shear, associated with the remnants of Lee, tracked from southwest to northeast across the area.  This combined with an unstable atmosphere as breaks in the clouds allowed temperatures to warm into the lower 80s.  Numerous strong thunderstorm cells developed quickly and tracked first from the Columbus area and west central Georgia into northeast Georgia.  Strong mesocyclones were indicated in many of these cells and prompted dozens of tornado warnings.  However, only one thunderstorm cell actually netted a tornado, which caused considerable damage in Cherokee county, just northwest of Atlanta.||As the outer remnant feeder bands moved away from the area during the mid-evening, the remnant core of Tropical Storm Lee passed by just to the west across northwest Alabama.  A two to three hour window of strong winds gusting to 35 to 40 mph were observed in several northwest Georgia counties as this occurred causing damage to dozens of trees and a number of power lines during this time frame.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia and the Cherokee County Emergency Manager confirmed that an EF1 tornado, spawned by strong shear associated with the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee, touched down in southern Cherokee county, just south of the Dixie Speedway, or just west of Woodstock, then tracked north-northeast across eastern Cherokee county before moving into southeastern Pickens county near the city of Nelson.  The tornado, with a semi-continuous path nearly 24 miles long across Cherokee county, had a maximum path width of 1/4 mile and maximum wind gusts of 90 mph.  The tornado caused extensive damage to homes and business across eastern Cherokee county.  The Brookshire and Town Lake Hills South subdivisions sustained much of the structural damage within the county.  The Dixie Speedway, just west of Woodstock, suffered extensive damage as well.  A number of recreational vehicles and boats were parked at the facility in anticipation of an event.  Dozens of these were overturned and destroyed by the tornado.  Over 600 single-family homes sustained some form of structural damage, with seven of these homes completely destroyed.  One injury was confirmed at one of the heavily damaged homes.  A total of 148 homes sustained major damage and 269 sustained minor damage.  In addition, six apartment units sustained damage, with three of these classified as having major damage.  Twenty commercial businesses were affected by the tornado, three of which were destroyed.  Sixteen of these businesses suffered major damage.  Finally, three churches sustained damage, two of which suffered major damage.  In addition to the structural damage, hundreds of trees were damaged or destroyed by the tornado, many of which subsequently caused damage to adjacent structures and dozens of vehicles.||[09/05/11: Tornado #1, County #1-2, EF1, Cherokee-Pickens, 2011:025].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 17.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Despite widespread rainfall of four to five inches across northwest Georgia with localized six to eight inches, the ongoing drought across the state resulted in minimal impacts of the heavy rain on the area,  The bigger problems came during the afternoon of the 5th when an area of strong shear, associated with the remnants of Lee, tracked from southwest to northeast across the area.  This combined with an unstable atmosphere as breaks in the clouds allowed temperatures to warm into the lower 80s.  Numerous strong thunderstorm cells developed quickly and tracked first from the Columbus area and west central Georgia into northeast Georgia.  Strong mesocyclones were indicated in many of these cells and prompted dozens of tornado warnings.  However, only one thunderstorm cell actually netted a tornado, which caused considerable damage in Cherokee county, just northwest of Atlanta.||As the outer remnant feeder bands moved away from the area during the mid-evening, the remnant core of Tropical Storm Lee passed by just to the west across northwest Alabama.  A two to three hour window of strong winds gusting to 35 to 40 mph were observed in several northwest Georgia counties as this occurred causing damage to dozens of trees and a number of power lines during this time frame.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City, Georgia and the Cherokee County Emergency Manager confirmed that an EF1 tornado, spawned by strong shear associated with the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee, touched down in southern Cherokee county, just south of the Dixie Speedway, or just west of Woodstock, then tracked north-northeast across eastern Cherokee county before moving into southeastern Pickens county near the city of Nelson.  The tornado, with a semi-continuous path nearly 24 miles long across Cherokee county, had a maximum path width of 1/4 mile and maximum wind gusts of 90 mph.  The tornado caused extensive damage to homes and business across eastern Cherokee county.  The Brookshire and Town Lake Hills South subdivisions sustained much of the structural damage within the county.  The Dixie Speedway, just west of Woodstock, suffered extensive damage as well.  A number of recreational vehicles and boats were parked at the facility in anticipation of an event.  Dozens of these were overturned and destroyed by the tornado.  Over 600 single-family homes sustained some form of structural damage, with seven of these homes completely destroyed.  One injury was confirmed at one of the heavily damaged homes.  A total of 148 homes sustained major damage and 269 sustained minor damage.  In addition, six apartment units sustained damage, with three of these classified as having major damage.  Twenty commercial businesses were affected by the tornado, three of which were destroyed.  Sixteen of these businesses suffered major damage.  Finally, three churches sustained damage, two of which suffered major damage.  In addition to the structural damage, hundreds of trees were damaged or destroyed by the tornado, many of which subsequently caused damage to adjacent structures and dozens of vehicles.||[09/05/11: Tornado #1, County #1-2, EF1, Cherokee-Pickens, 2011:025].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 17.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This severe weather outbreak primarily targeted western and northeast portions of the area, largely sparing locations south of the Highway 6 corridor between Holdrege and Geneva. The final tornado breakdown per the EF Scale included two EF3, four EF2, two EF1 and three EF0. Despite considerable damage to mainly rural residences, these tornadoes resulted in no fatalities and only one known non-life threatening injury when a semi truck was tipped over near Elm Creek in Buffalo County. This Elm Creek tornado was also the only one to directly strike a community, although there were several close calls within a mile or two of places such as Amherst, Hampton and Bradshaw. Interestingly, tornadic storms also spared the immediate Tri-Cities population centers of Grand Island, Hastings and Kearney, despite damaging events occurring nearby to both the west and the east. This was largely due to the fact that an expansive mid-level dry intrusion became anchored over central sections of South Central Nebraska, protecting this area from storm development. In addition to tornadoes, the afternoon also featured several reports of large hail up to baseball size, and damaging winds up to 80 MPH. ||This outbreak focused between 3 and 8 PM CDT, as a seasonably powerful mid-level low pressure system lifted into western Kansas and Nebraska out of Colorado, deepening and closing off as it did so. Strong wind fields aloft were in place at all levels, with a 50-70 knot jet streak nosing into the region between the 500 and 300 millibar level, and an 850-millibar low-level jet accelerating to between 30 and 40 knots. At the surface, a well-defined 992-millibar low pressure center migrated from north central Kansas around the noon hour, to near Hastings by early evening. A synoptically classic array of surface boundaries evolved around this low pressure center, with a warm front lifting north across South Central Nebraska, while a cold front and dryline pushed in from the west and southwest. In addition, a well-defined inverted surface trough axis extended nearly due north from the surface low into north central Nebraska. The net combination synoptic and mesoscale features yielded a very favorable setup for tornadic supercells across the area. At mid-afternoon, shear and instability parameters included approximately 50 knots of deep-layer vertical wind shear, 15-25 knots of 0-1 kilometer low-level vertical wind shear, 150 to over 300 m2/s2 of surface to 1 kilometer storm-relative helicity and 2000-4000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE. ||In general, there were two distinct corridors of tornadic storms across the area, one focused west of Highway 281, and one mainly east of Highway 281 and along and north of Interstate 80. The first tornadic storm of the day entered southwestern Harlan County around 3 PM CDT, having produced several damaging tornadoes across northwest and north central Kansas since early afternoon. This storm spawned an EF1 tornado in the Stamford area, before weakening. Within minutes however, a newly developed tornadic storm started tracking north from Phelps County into southwestern Buffalo County. Between 330 and 445 PM CDT, this storm dropped several tornadoes from near Elm Creek, to north of Amherst, including the first EF3 of the day. This EF3 near Amherst intensified to at least 3/4 of a mile wide, and significantly damaged or destroyed at least 10 homes. A veteran storm chaser described this tornado as being one of the strongest he had ever witnessed as it tracked north of Amherst. An additional tornadic storm that initiated in Buffalo County, along with subsequent storm-scale interactions from further development, moved north and produced several more tornadoes between 430 and 545 PM CDT, including an EF2 southwest of Rockville, and an EF1 that struck the Davis Creek Reservoir campground south of North Loup. ||While tornadoes were ongoing across western portions of the area, vigorous new supercell development took place in eastern portions of South Central Nebraska around 430 PM CDT, just east of the surface triple-point. Two storms in close proximity to one another both became tornadic around 530 PM CDT near the Hamilton and York County line. The first produced an EF2 that crossed Interstate 80 southwest of Hampton. As this tornado moved north of Hampton, two farm workers fashioned a narrow escape by sprinting nearly 100 yards to an underground windmill pit and jumping inside as the tornado passed overhead. Just to the east, the other storm also dropped an EF2 tornado, which also happened to be the longest continuous tornado track of the day, traveling 15 miles from southwest of Bradshaw to near the York-Polk County line. Within a few minutes of this tornado's demise, the cyclic supercell quickly put down the second EF3 tornado of the day, tracking over 9 miles from east of Polk to west-northwest of Osceola. This tornado grew to around 1/2-mile wide, and damaged several farms along the way, with some of the most significant damage along Highway 92. After this tornado dissipated around 620 PM CDT, the parent supercell and other severe storms farther west finally lifted north out of South Central Nebraska. Although this ended the main severe weather event for the evening, a few additional strong to severe storms affected primarily Fillmore and Furnas Counties between 630 and 830 PM CDT. ||Taking a backseat to significant tornadoes on this day were hail and heavy rainfall. Some of the largest reported hailstones included baseball size in Buffalo County, and tennis ball size in York County. Rainfall-wise, although there were no widespread flooding impacts, localized rural flooding occurred as many locations received 1-3 inches in a rather short time. Some northwestern portions of South Central Nebraska, including parts of Valley, Greeley and Sherman Counties measured 48-hour rainfall totals into the 3-4 inch range.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> While the tornado south of Elm Creek was in the process of dissipating, a second tornado formed approximately 1 mile west of Elm Creek.  This multi-vortex tornado moved east into town, and caused widespread damage, before making a sharp turn to the north and dissipating approximately 4 miles north of Elm Creek.  Much of the damage occurred to trees, however several homes received damage, including major roof damage to homes in both the north and south parts of Elm Creek.  Outbuildings were also destroyed in the northwest part of town.  One non-life threatening injury occurred to a man whose semi-truck was tipped on its side by the tornado. The maximum wind speed of this tornado was estimated to be 120 MPH.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 750.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This severe weather outbreak primarily targeted western and northeast portions of the area, largely sparing locations south of the Highway 6 corridor between Holdrege and Geneva. The final tornado breakdown per the EF Scale included two EF3, four EF2, two EF1 and three EF0. Despite considerable damage to mainly rural residences, these tornadoes resulted in no fatalities and only one known non-life threatening injury when a semi truck was tipped over near Elm Creek in Buffalo County. This Elm Creek tornado was also the only one to directly strike a community, although there were several close calls within a mile or two of places such as Amherst, Hampton and Bradshaw. Interestingly, tornadic storms also spared the immediate Tri-Cities population centers of Grand Island, Hastings and Kearney, despite damaging events occurring nearby to both the west and the east. This was largely due to the fact that an expansive mid-level dry intrusion became anchored over central sections of South Central Nebraska, protecting this area from storm development. In addition to tornadoes, the afternoon also featured several reports of large hail up to baseball size, and damaging winds up to 80 MPH. ||This outbreak focused between 3 and 8 PM CDT, as a seasonably powerful mid-level low pressure system lifted into western Kansas and Nebraska out of Colorado, deepening and closing off as it did so. Strong wind fields aloft were in place at all levels, with a 50-70 knot jet streak nosing into the region between the 500 and 300 millibar level, and an 850-millibar low-level jet accelerating to between 30 and 40 knots. At the surface, a well-defined 992-millibar low pressure center migrated from north central Kansas around the noon hour, to near Hastings by early evening. A synoptically classic array of surface boundaries evolved around this low pressure center, with a warm front lifting north across South Central Nebraska, while a cold front and dryline pushed in from the west and southwest. In addition, a well-defined inverted surface trough axis extended nearly due north from the surface low into north central Nebraska. The net combination synoptic and mesoscale features yielded a very favorable setup for tornadic supercells across the area. At mid-afternoon, shear and instability parameters included approximately 50 knots of deep-layer vertical wind shear, 15-25 knots of 0-1 kilometer low-level vertical wind shear, 150 to over 300 m2/s2 of surface to 1 kilometer storm-relative helicity and 2000-4000 J/kg mixed-layer CAPE. ||In general, there were two distinct corridors of tornadic storms across the area, one focused west of Highway 281, and one mainly east of Highway 281 and along and north of Interstate 80.

By the evening of Thursday, 1 September 2011, the tropical wave further developed into Tropical Depression 13. By 1 PM the following Friday afternoon, Tropical Depression Lee had formed. Lee slowly moved northward towards the south central Louisiana coastline by Saturday afternoon 3 September, while continuing to produce extremely heavy rainfall over portions of southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama and the northwest Florida Panhandle. ||The outer rain-bands of Lee produced near-continuous heavy rainfall over portions of southern Alabama, southeastern Mississippi and the northwestern Florida Panhandle by early Saturday morning and that endured through early Sunday before dry air aloft wrapped into Lee���s western side. The center of Lee moved over land around sunrise Sunday, 4 September. However, it would be a while before Lee would weaken to a depression because it remained nearly stationary while the southern half of the circulation was over water where it could continue to derive additional energy from the warm ocean. The next day, Lee was eventually picked up by an upper air trough, turned northeastward and resumed a faster forward speed late in the day on Sunday, 4 September as it began its welcome exit to the northeast late Sunday through late Monday.||Lee���s impacts were far reaching across our region. Although the continuous rains became somewhat intermittent as dry air wrapped into Lee from the west, this created a situation from Sunday afternoon through midday Monday whereby individual thunderstorms became more intense due to increasing levels of atmospheric instability. Stronger thunderstorms and isolated tornadoes affected the North Central Gulf Coast Region, as they formed within the detached outer spiral rain-bands well to the east of Lee���s center on Sunday and finally to the southeast on Monday. The highest total storm tide levels (astronomical plus surge effects) ranged from approximately 3.5 to just barely over 5 feet.||While Lee was in the process of being picked up by a fast moving upper air trough, a series of squall lines that produced moderately widespread thunderstorm wind damage along and ahead of the surface cold front, as well as more isolated tornadoes, affected the area through late Monday afternoon. In all, some 10 to 15 inches of rain fell along coastal sections of Alabama and northwest Florida. Additionally, several weak tornadoes occurred producing modest structural and tree damage. There was also moderate beach erosion and the rip currents endured over a multi-day period. Inland flooding was exacerbated along the immediate coastal zone by higher tide levels due to Lee���s surge effects which created poor to no drainage of area coastal rivers, bays and sounds on during astronomical high tide cycles from 3-5 September (late night hours each day).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down just north of Bankston Road which is just west of the town of Perkinston.  The tornado moved north and lifted in the town of Bond near the intersection of U.S. Highway 49 and Pump Branch Road.  The path length was approximately 9 miles, but was not always fully in contact with the ground and became very narrow in several places.  Numerous trees were blown over or snapped with several trees snapped off at the top.  Two residences suffered damage from the tornado.  A double-wide mobile home on Sumrall Road west of Perkinston lost 40 percent of its roof.  The mobile home was also shifted off its concrete masonry unit piers, consistent with EF-1 intensity damage with winds between 86 MPH and 110 MPH.

By about 3 pm, the storms entered western Massachusetts and were in the form of discrete supercells.  By 4 pm, several supercells had developed across southern Vermont, southwest New Hampshire, and western Massachusetts.  At that time, the supercell which eventually produced the most significant tornado entered Hampden County from the Berkshires.   This cell produced what was evaluated to be an EF-3 tornado touching down in Westfield and continuing on a 38 mile long trek through West Springfield, Springfield, Wilbraham, Monson, Brimfield, and Sturbridge.  This tornado was on the ground for an estimated 70 minutes.||About two hours later, another supercell tracked just to the north of the storm track of the EF3 tornado. While its rotation was not as strong, it produced brief tornadoes in Wilbraham (EF1), North Brimfield (EF1), and Sturbridge (EF0).||While the focus was certainly on the tornadoes and their damage, damaging winds, large hail up to two inches in diameter, and some flash flooding also occurred across southern New England.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A supercell thunderstorm developed over western Massachusetts.  This storm strengthened and produced a long-lived, very significant tornado that did extensive damage across southwest and south central Massachusetts.||This storm will be noted not only for its intensity, but also for the length of the continuous damage path, approximately 38 miles, 31 of which were in Hampden County.  The tornado was also very wide at some points, reaching a maximum width of one half mile.||The tornado first touched down in the Munger Hill section of Westfield with damage mainly limited to trees, many uprooted and snapped.  The roof of Munger Hill Elementary School was also damaged.  The tornado rapidly intensified as it moved into West Springfield and caused extensive damage to industrial buildings and homes.  Several buildings had their roofs removed by the tornado, a few structures collapsed, and several multi-story buildings lost their upper stories.  ||The tornado then crossed the Connecticut River adjacent to the Memorial Avenue bridge and into the city of Springfield.  Here the tornado produced extensive damage to the south side of the downtown area with many homes destroyed.  In addition, commercial brick buildings sustained major damage.  Roofs were removed from many of these large commercial structures.  The tornado also produced severe structural damage to townhomes and apartments near Springfield College.  The tornado continued moving east into the Island Pond section of Springfield, where Cathedral High School and St. Michael's Academy sustained significant damage and many homes in this part of the city were completely destroyed.||The tornado continued to move east through Wilbraham near the Wilbraham/Hampden town line producing nearly complete deforestation and significant damage to nearby structures.||Widespread damage occurred in Monson as the tornado moved directly through the center of town.  Many houses were completely destroyed and significant damage was done to commercial and residential buildings.  The roof of Monson High School was destroyed.  Forested parts of town experienced nearly complete deforestation and in some locations the bark was stripped from the tree trunks.||The tornado moved across the Brimfield State Forest where it reached its maximum width of approximately one half mile.  Additional significant damage occurred both to structures and forested areas for many miles through Brimfield before crossing into Worcester County just south of Route 20.||Three fatalities were directly attributable to the tornado, two in West Springfield and one in Brimfield.  A thirty-nine year old woman in West Springfield was killed when her house collapsed on her while she sheltered her 15 year old daughter in the bathtub.  Also in West Springfield, a twenty-three year old man was killed when his van was crushed by a falling tree.  A fifty-two year old woman in Brimfield was killed when the trailer home she was living in was thrown 35 feet into the air.  In addition, two hundred people were treated for injuries sustained in the tornado.||It was estimated that 1400 houses and at least 78 businesses were either damaged or destroyed.  Of these 1400 houses, roughly 300 of them had been completely destroyed, including about 200 in Springfield, 51 in Monson, 39 in Brimfield, and 13 in Wilbraham.  Two hundred residential buildings were condemned and more than 300 rental units were lost throughout western Massachusetts.  ||Two public schools in Springfield and one in Westfield were severely damaged by the tornado.  At least two parochial schools were also destroyed. The students attending these schools were temporarily assigned to other area schools for the remainder of the school year.  Public school students will begin the 2011-2012 school year in modular buildings on the site of their former school buildings and parochial students will be travelling to temporary locations, some outside their home city.||Nearly 10,000 acres of woodlands were destoyed with the Massachusetts Forest Landowners Association estimating a clean up cost of $3.6 million.  This is included in the property damage estimate.  In Springfield alone, 7500 mature trees were uprooted or destroyed.||Shelters that opened across western Massachusetts on June 1, sheltered a total of 330 residents for a total of 30 days.||President Obama issued a Major Disaster Declaration for Hampden County shortly after the tornado.||The Massachusetts Division of Insurance reported that 9500 insurance claims were completed by residents as a result of the June 1 tornadoes, adding up to $175 million worth of damage.

In the wake of this system, hundreds of people were left injured and/or homeless, along with approximately 100 people who lost their lives in the northern Alabama area alone. Some of the devastation was literally unimaginable with countless homes, neighborhoods and even portions of cities or towns either partially or completely destroyed. This storm system would be responsible for one of the largest and deadliest tornado outbreaks to ever impact much of the southeastern region.| |The powerful storm system that affected the National Weather Service, Huntsville service area would actually occur in three separate waves of severe weather that day. The first occurred during the early morning hours of April 27, 2011 roughly between the hours of 2 AM and 8 AM CDT, while the second occurred during the late-morning to early afternoon period. The third and most devastating wave occurred during the afternoon hours on Wednesday, with some of the most violent and destructive tornadoes to affect the central Tennessee Valley area in recent decades.| |The worst areas impacted by these storms included the towns of Phil Campbell and Oak Grove in eastern Franklin County Alabama, Mt. Hope in western Lawrence County and the Tanner Community in eastern Limestone County. Along a line connecting these areas tracked an EF5 tornado with peak winds around 210 mph, the strongest and most violent on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. ||Other areas impacted by the storms include the city of Cullman, where extensive damage occurred to buildings in the downtown area, and to the town of Fairview, both of which are located in Cullman County. Downstream, further significant damage occurred to the Ruth and Oak Grove communities in Marshall County. In addition, the communities of Rainsville and Sylvania along with the towns of Henagar and Ider in DeKalb County were severely impacted. Fatalities in DeKalb County alone numbered at least 33 people. Furthermore, the towns of Flat Rock, Higdon and Pisgah in Jackson County sustained incredible damage. The tornadoes that affected these areas were rated as an EF4 with maximum winds near 190 mph.||In most of these areas alone, numerous people lost their lives. These represent just several of the communities and towns impacted by the events of April 27, 2011. While the majority of the analysis and survey work conducted by the National Weather Service, Huntsville and its partners have been completed, there will undoubtedly be countless research studies conducted by both academia and operational personnel in order to further evaluate and understand the complex processes associated with this near unprecedented severe weather outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado crossed in Madison County east of Limestone County Prison���along Orvil Smith Road with a path width of �� mile.  The tornado maintained an EF-3 strength with winds of 140 to 160 MPH and a path width between �� and �� mile for much of its track northeast across Old Railroad Bed Road and Ford Chapel Road, before narrowing to around 300 yards in Anderson Hills. Dozens of well-constructed homes were destroyed, in some cases with all exterior walls collapsing in both single and two-story homes. At least 3-5 mobile homes were either destroyed or swept completely clean with no evidence of debris.  At least 2 other well-constructed homes had complete wall collapse in Anderson Hills and were shifted off their foundation. This damage was once again consistent with low end EF-4 wind speeds of around 170 MPH.||Numerous tall pines and other hardwood trees were snapped, uprooted and debarked along the entire path. The path width widened once again to around �� mile as the tornado tracked through residential areas along Bald Eagle Lane, Old Eli Road and Ginnery Row.  At least 2 of these homes had complete wall collapse, but these structures had foundation straps and nails in lieu of bolts. At least one fatality was confirmed at one of these residences. Eight additional fatalities occurred in Madison County along the track of this violent tornado. The damage was consistent with high end EF-3 wind speeds between 140 and 160 MPH. The tornado lifted just south of the Patterson Lane after twisting irrigation equipment and snapping additional trees. Just to the northeast of this location, the tornado touched down again as an EF-0 tornado with peak wind speeds of 70 MPH. Along Grimwood Road and Walker Lane, south of Hazel Green, the tornado uprooted and snapped several trees. The tornado weakened or may have lifted briefly across extreme northeast Madison County before re-strengthening again as it entered Lincoln County in Southern Middle Tennessee.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This storm system would be responsible for one of the largest and deadliest tornado outbreaks to ever impact much of the southeastern region.| |The powerful storm system that affected the National Weather Service, Huntsville service area would actually occur in three separate waves of severe weather that day. The first occurred during the early morning hours of April 27, 2011 roughly between the hours of 2 AM and 8 AM CDT, while the second occurred during the late-morning to early afternoon period. The third and most devastating wave occurred during the afternoon hours on Wednesday, with some of the most violent and destructive tornadoes to affect the central Tennessee Valley area in recent decades.| |The worst areas impacted by these storms included the towns of Phil Campbell and Oak Grove in eastern Franklin County Alabama, Mt. Hope in western Lawrence County and the Tanner Community in eastern Limestone County. Along a line connecting these areas tracked an EF5 tornado with peak winds around 210 mph, the strongest and most violent on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. ||Other areas impacted by the storms include the city of Cullman, where extensive damage occurred to buildings in the downtown area, and to the town of Fairview, both of which are located in Cullman County. Downstream, further significant damage occurred to the Ruth and Oak Grove communities in Marshall County. In addition, the communities of Rainsville and Sylvania along with the towns of Henagar and Ider in DeKalb County were severely impacted. Fatalities in DeKalb County alone numbered at least 33 people. Furthermore, the towns of Flat Rock, Higdon and Pisgah in Jackson County sustained incredible damage. The tornadoes that affected these areas were rated as an EF4 with maximum winds near 190 mph.||In most of these areas alone, numerous people lost their lives. These represent just several of the communities and towns impacted by the events of April 27, 2011. While the majority of the analysis and survey work conducted by the National Weather Service, Huntsville and its partners have been completed, there will undoubtedly be countless research studies conducted by both academia and operational personnel in order to further evaluate and understand the complex processes associated with this near unprecedented severe weather outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado crossed in Madison County east of Limestone County Prison���along Orvil Smith Road with a path width of �� mile.  The tornado maintained an EF-3 strength with winds of 140 to 160 MPH and a path width between �� and �� mile for much of its track northeast across Old Railroad Bed Road and Ford Chapel Road, before narrowing to around 300 yards in Anderson Hills. Dozens of well-constructed homes were destroyed, in some cases with all exterior walls collapsing in both single and two-story homes. At least 3-5 mobile homes were either destroyed or swept completely clean with no evidence of debris.  At least 2 other well-constructed homes had complete wall collapse in Anderson Hills and were shifted off their foundation. This damage was once again consistent with low end EF-4 wind speeds of around 170 MPH.||Numerous tall pines and other hardwood trees were snapped, uprooted and debarked along the entire path. The path width widened once again to around �� mile as the tornado tracked through residential areas along Bald Eagle Lane, Old Eli Road and Ginnery Row.  At least 2 of these homes had complete wall collapse, but these structures had foundation straps and nails in lieu of bolts. At least one fatality was confirmed at one of these residences. Eight additional fatalities occurred in Madison County along the track of this violent tornado. The damage was consistent with high end EF-3 wind speeds between 140 and 160 MPH. The tornado lifted just south of the Patterson Lane after twisting irrigation equipment and snapping additional trees. Just to the northeast of this location, the tornado touched down again as an EF-0 tornado with peak wind speeds of 70 MPH. Along Grimwood Road and Walker Lane, south of Hazel Green, the tornado uprooted and snapped several trees. The tornado weakened or may have lifted briefly across extreme northeast Madison County before re-strengthening again as it entered Lincoln County in Southern Middle Tennessee.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

By the end of the day, one EF-5, two EF-4, and two EF-3 tornadoes destroyed buildings, ripped up trees and power poles, and unfortunately, resulted in 11 deaths. The day began with a strong upper level trough ejecting out of the southwest United States. The trough took on a negative tilt as it approached the southern Plains. A strong jet stream was located at both the middle and upper levels rotating around the upper trough. At the surface, a low pressure strengthened rapidly over northwest Oklahoma, keeping the low-level flow of warm, moist air to flow east of a dry line that had moved into western Oklahoma. Thunderstorms developed by early afternoon over western Oklahoma, and quickly became supercellular as they moved northeast. Strong low-level rotation developed early, with the first tornado occurring over Blaine county, and moved northeast into Major county. Another supercell rapidly gained low-level rotation as it moved from Caddo into Canadian County. This tornado became the strongest of them all as it moved north of El Reno, west of Piedmont, and to south of Guthrie in Logan county. Nine people died as a result of this tornado. Two more powerful supercells developed over Grady county, and they moved northeast into McClain and Cleveland counties. Finally, the final tornado occurred east of Norman into Pottawatomie county.

The third and most devastating wave occurred during the afternoon hours on Wednesday, with some of the most violent and destructive tornadoes to affect the central Tennessee Valley area in recent decades.| |The worst areas impacted by these storms included the towns of Phil Campbell and Oak Grove in eastern Franklin County Alabama, Mt.

Along a line connecting these areas tracked an EF5 tornado with peak winds around 210 mph, the strongest and most violent on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. ||Other areas impacted by the storms include the city of Cullman, where extensive damage occurred to buildings in the downtown area, and to the town of Fairview, both of which are located in Cullman County. Downstream, further significant damage occurred to the Ruth and Oak Grove communities in Marshall County. In addition, the communities of Rainsville and Sylvania along with the towns of Henagar and Ider in DeKalb County were severely impacted. Fatalities in DeKalb County alone numbered at least 33 people. Furthermore, the towns of Flat Rock, Higdon and Pisgah in Jackson County sustained incredible damage.

The tornado rapidly intensified and began producing high end EF-3 to low end EF-4 damage within a matter of minutes, with peak wind speeds of 150 to 170 mph, and a path width of 1/2 to 3/4 mile as it roared into areas northeast of Pisgah and north of Rosalie.

There was evidence of this in the damage swath.||The tornado swarmed several mobile homes and block foundation homes in its path, snapping or uprooting thousands of trees.  Numerous trees were debarked in the process.  The tornado leveled at least 2 mobile homes and swept their remains hundreds of yards downwind.  Three were killed in 3 separate residences (6 total fatalities - 2 in Pisgah and 4 in the Higdon/Flat Rock communities).  Several vehicles were launched or swept several yards in different directions, in a few cases up to 50 yards.  The Friendship Church roof was heavily damaged.  Several farms were also affected, with barns and chicken houses heavily damaged or destroyed.||As the tornado continued its path, it intensified further on approach to Flat Rock and Higdon, producing damage of high end EF-4 intensity with peak winds up to 190 mph.  The tornado killed three from the same family at a residence southwest of Flat Rock.  The tornado mowed thousands in up to a 3/4 mile wide path.  One well-built block foundation home literally exploded as the tornado struck, lifting and sweeping all its structure and contents downwind, in some cases several hundred yards.  Miraculously, a mother and 3 children taking refuge in a hallway were completely unharmed.  At this farm, all fencing was destroyed and up to 19 cattle perished.  Two chicken barns were completely obliterated and swept away and unidentifiable.

Some of the storms produced tornadoes as well as a lot of large hail.  There were 6 tornadoes with this event, including an EF3.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The path of this tornado was a very curved one as it initially tornado touched down about 2.5 miles west of Girard, Illinois, on Emerson Airline Road.  It caused extensive damage to a couple of houses in this location.  It then travelled to the northeast crossing Henry Road, north of the intersection with Emerson Airline Road, and damaging 3 farmsteads.  One home was destroyed and another home sustained moderate damage, trapping the residents in the basement until they could be rescued.  Also, several barns were destroyed in this area.  The tornado began to travel on a more easterly course, damaging or destroying several farmsteads on Neff Road.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in this area and one house was destroyed.  As it approached Pleasant Hill Road approximately 1.2 miles northwest of Girard, it caused major damage to a brick home and destroyed all of the outbuildings.  The tornado continued to travel to the east, destroying a farm about a mile north of town on Illinois Route 4.  Several cows were killed in this location.  Then the tornado began to curve back to the southeast, crossing  Prose Road about half a mile south of the intersection with Substation Road.  In this location it caused extensive damage to a brick home with most of the exterior walls destroyed but with the interior wall structure intact.  This damage was rated EF3.  The tornado continued to the southeast.  It caused moderate roof damage to a house on Kimes Road near intersection with Adams Road.  The tornado then lifted and dissipated on Adams Road after hitting one last farmstead and causing minor damage.  Several farms sustained damage along the path of the tornado with many of the houses that were damaged rated EF2 with large portions of the roofs badly damaged.  Numerous outbuildings were either destroyed or sustained major damage along this track as well.   Also, about 20 power poles were blown down along Illinois Route 4 just north of town.  The average path width of the tornado was 150 yards with a maximum width of 200 yards.  The highest rating of the damage was EF3 and with peak wind speeds of 150 mph.  Two miles west of Girard, two people heading for the basement to seek shelter from the tornado, sustained minor cuts and bruises.  Because the path of the tornado was curved the actual total path length of the tornado was 5.1 miles, not 4.3 miles as displayed in the main header for this event.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It caused extensive damage to a couple of houses in this location.  It then travelled to the northeast crossing Henry Road, north of the intersection with Emerson Airline Road, and damaging 3 farmsteads.

As it approached Pleasant Hill Road approximately 1.2 miles northwest of Girard, it caused major damage to a brick home and destroyed all of the outbuildings.  The tornado continued to travel to the east, destroying a farm about a mile north of town on Illinois Route 4.  Several cows were killed in this location.

By the end of the day, one EF-5, two EF-4, and two EF-3 tornadoes destroyed buildings, ripped up trees and power poles, and unfortunately, resulted in 11 deaths. The day began with a strong upper level trough ejecting out of the southwest United States. The trough took on a negative tilt as it approached the southern Plains. A strong jet stream was located at both the middle and upper levels rotating around the upper trough. At the surface, a low pressure strengthened rapidly over northwest Oklahoma, keeping the low-level flow of warm, moist air to flow east of a dry line that had moved into western Oklahoma. Thunderstorms developed by early afternoon over western Oklahoma, and quickly became supercellular as they moved northeast. Strong low-level rotation developed early, with the first tornado occurring over Blaine county, and moved northeast into Major county. Another supercell rapidly gained low-level rotation as it moved from Caddo into Canadian County. This tornado became the strongest of them all as it moved north of El Reno, west of Piedmont, and to south of Guthrie in Logan county. Nine people died as a result of this tornado. Two more powerful supercells developed over Grady county, and they moved northeast into McClain and Cleveland counties. Finally, the final tornado occurred east of Norman into Pottawatomie county. The timing of this outbreak could not have come at a worse time, as rush hour was just unfolding as the tornadoes neared the Oklahoma City metro area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado is labeled Tornado B2 (Segment #1 of the Calumet-El Reno-Piedmont-Guthrie tornado). This tornado began very close to the Caddo/Canadian county border and quickly became a strong/violent tornado. The tornado destroyed numerous trees, many of them were debarked, before crossing Interstate 40. Three people died in vehicles near the I-40 Calumet exit, and two other fatalities occurred just northeast of that location. Cars were thrown thousands of feet off the roadways. It is believed that the tornado reached its maximum intensity just after crossing I-40, and it was here that a mobile radar measured winds of greater than 210 mph just off the surface. The El Reno Oklahoma Mesonet station (5 miles west) measured wind gusts of 131 and 151 mph. From this location, the tornado continued northeast, narrowly missing the town of Piedmont. Widespread EF-3, occasional EF-4 damage occurred between El Reno and Piedmont. More widespread EF-4 damage was seen west and north of Piedmont. Especially hard hit was the Falcon Lake neighborhood, near the Kingfisher county border. Two children were killed at this location. The tornado continued into southeastern Kingfisher County. Monetary damage estimates were not available at this time, but were probably going to be well in the tens of millions.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Numerous reports of large hail and 5 tornadoes occurred with this event.  One of the tornadoes was a long track one that moved through the St. Louis metropolitan area with it being rated an EF4, with only a few minor injuries and no deaths. Also, quite a bit of rain fell during this event and caused flash flooding.  The flash flooding persisted for several days as additional rounds of heavy rain fell over the same region through the 26th of April.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado touched down on the north side of Waterloo, Illinois near the intersection of Leah Drive and James Street.  Several homes and businesses sustained varying degrees of damage; from displaced roofing materials to businesses with structural damage. Two large air conditioners were tossed 30 yards from the roof of a business.  Several large trees were snapped near the base of the trunk. Four power poles were snapped south of the intersection of North Market Street and Kolmer Avenue.  One large garage was also destroyed behind a church with debris tossed southeastward 30 to 40 yards.  The tornado skipped eastward and crossed Floraville Road on the north side of Ridge Club Golf Course then traveled down the first fairway. A number of cedar and pine trees were snapped. The tornado then crossed Ridge Road where several homes sustained minor roof damage, with 30 to 40 percent of the shingles removed. The tornado then traveled across the northern part of Konarcik Park. Numerous old growth pine trees were snapped at the base of the trunk. Trees three feet in diameter were common in this area. The tornado caused damage to the siding of one home near the intersection of Konarcik and Kopp Roads before lifting.  There was one minor injury at Canterbury Manor Nursing Center due to flying glass when a window broke.  The maximum intensity was low end EF2, with a maximum estimated wind speed of 115 mph.  The maximum width of the tornado was 80 to 90 yards with a total path length of 3.5 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

With plenty of moisture, instability and decent low level shear, severe storms developed along the Interstate 70 corridor in Missouri and Illinois.  Numerous reports of large hail and 5 tornadoes occurred with this event.  One of the tornadoes was a long track one that moved through the St. Louis metropolitan area with it being rated an EF4, with only a few minor injuries and no deaths. Also, quite a bit of rain fell during this event and caused flash flooding.  The flash flooding persisted for several days as additional rounds of heavy rain fell over the same region through the 26th of April.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado touched down on the north side of Waterloo, Illinois near the intersection of Leah Drive and James Street.  Several homes and businesses sustained varying degrees of damage; from displaced roofing materials to businesses with structural damage. Two large air conditioners were tossed 30 yards from the roof of a business.  Several large trees were snapped near the base of the trunk. Four power poles were snapped south of the intersection of North Market Street and Kolmer Avenue.  One large garage was also destroyed behind a church with debris tossed southeastward 30 to 40 yards.  The tornado skipped eastward and crossed Floraville Road on the north side of Ridge Club Golf Course then traveled down the first fairway. A number of cedar and pine trees were snapped. The tornado then crossed Ridge Road where several homes sustained minor roof damage, with 30 to 40 percent of the shingles removed. The tornado then traveled across the northern part of Konarcik Park. Numerous old growth pine trees were snapped at the base of the trunk. Trees three feet in diameter were common in this area. The tornado caused damage to the siding of one home near the intersection of Konarcik and Kopp Roads before lifting.  There was one minor injury at Canterbury Manor Nursing Center due to flying glass when a window broke.  The maximum intensity was low end EF2, with a maximum estimated wind speed of 115 mph.  The maximum width of the tornado was 80 to 90 yards with a total path length of 3.5 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Significant devastation occurred throughout the city of Phil Campbell. Prolific damage was noted from the intersection of CR 51 and Alabama Highway 237, to the intersection of CR 81 and CR 75. Within a two mile corridor of either side of the railroad tracks the damage was significant. Within this corridor, several well constructed houses were destroyed.  Along Bonner Street, multiple block homes were leveled to the ground with the block foundations destroyed.  A twenty-five foot section of pavement was sucked up and scattered. Chunks of the pavement were found in a home over 1/3 of a mile down the road. The damage in this area was consistent with EF-5 damage. ||In addition, at least three churches along the path sustained significant damage.   One church in Phil Campbell was completely destroyed with only the slab remaining.||Multiple mobile homes throughout the path were completely destroyed, and their mangled frames were tossed 25 to 50 yards.  Cars were tossed and destroyed throughout the path of the tornado, with one car wrapped around a debarked tree in Phil Campbell.   All along the path length, thousands of hardwood and softwood trees were snapped.  Hundreds of trees were also debarked and twisted, and had only stubs of the largest branches remaining.  EF-5 damage continued similarly northeast from Phil Campbell, roughly along County Roads 81 and 82 toward the community of Oak Grove.||In Oak Grove, the tornado may have reached a relative maximum in intensity well into the EF-5 category as the damage was slightly more intense and the path width was at a maximum of greater than one mile.  A large swath of complete devastation was noted in Oak Grove along County Roads 38 and Smith Lane.  A large well-constructed home with extensive anchoring was razed with debris carried well away from the site.  A Corvette sports car was mangled and thrown 641 feet (measured). A block home next door was also disintegrated.  Along Smith Lane a block home was wiped out and the only remains of a nearby chicken house was a small piece of a metal truss.  In this same area, the tree damage was significant and a large percentage of trees were stripped bare.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In the wake of this system, hundreds of people were left injured and/or homeless, along with approximately 100 people who lost their lives in the northern Alabama area alone. Some of the devastation was literally unimaginable with countless homes, neighborhoods and even portions of cities or towns either partially or completely destroyed. This storm system would be responsible for one of the largest and deadliest tornado outbreaks to ever impact much of the southeastern region.| |The powerful storm system that affected the National Weather Service, Huntsville service area would actually occur in three separate waves of severe weather that day. The first occurred during the early morning hours of April 27, 2011 roughly between the hours of 2 AM and 8 AM CDT, while the second occurred during the late-morning to early afternoon period. The third and most devastating wave occurred during the afternoon hours on Wednesday, with some of the most violent and destructive tornadoes to affect the central Tennessee Valley area in recent decades.| |The worst areas impacted by these storms included the towns of Phil Campbell and Oak Grove in eastern Franklin County Alabama, Mt. Hope in western Lawrence County and the Tanner Community in eastern Limestone County. Along a line connecting these areas tracked an EF5 tornado with peak winds around 210 mph, the strongest and most violent on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. ||Other areas impacted by the storms include the city of Cullman, where extensive damage occurred to buildings in the downtown area, and to the town of Fairview, both of which are located in Cullman County. Downstream, further significant damage occurred to the Ruth and Oak Grove communities in Marshall County. In addition, the communities of Rainsville and Sylvania along with the towns of Henagar and Ider in DeKalb County were severely impacted. Fatalities in DeKalb County alone numbered at least 33 people. Furthermore, the towns of Flat Rock, Higdon and Pisgah in Jackson County sustained incredible damage. The tornadoes that affected these areas were rated as an EF4 with maximum winds near 190 mph.||In most of these areas alone, numerous people lost their lives.

There was multiple tree and roof damage along Avent Ferry Road, southwest of Holly Springs. The tornado intensified to an EF1 with winds of 86 mph as it reached Fire Station Number Two and the Holly Glenn Subdivision before crossing highway 55 and tracking through the Remington subdivision.  The tornado continued to track northeastward and caused extensive tree damage and damage to numerous homes, mainly from fallen trees along Pierce Olive, Ten-Ten, Penny Road, and Yates Mill Pond roads, as wind speeds increased to around 100 mph. The tornado crossed Tryon Road, between Lake Wheeler Road and the Raleigh Golf Association Golf Course, before tracking northeast across the entire City of Raleigh, producing EF1 damage in a narrow swath between 50 to 100 yards. It crossed directly over Interstates 40-440, between exits 297 and 298 with damage on both sides of the interstate clearly visible. The tornado continued northeast across South Saunders Street, where 4 businesses were damaged. A body shop was completely destroyed when the roof was ripped off and the side walls collapsed. The tornado continued to snap hardwood trees and power-lines near Mount Hope Cemetery and nearby homes. The tornado weakened as it moved northeast towards Shaw University. Campus dormitories and the university student center had windows blown in with roof damage. The tornado moved northeast along the east side of the major high rise buildings in downtown Raleigh, downing hundreds of trees, many of which fell on houses.

The tornado then strengthened to an EF2 with winds greater than 110 mph as it continued northeast producing extensive tree damage in a 100 to 200 yard wide path from Stony Brook Drive to Buffalo Road. Snapped trees crashed onto and through numerous homes all along the path. Four fatalities occurred when a large tree fell|onto a mobile home. Two other mobile homes were thrown 30 to 50 feet when the tie downs snapped from their anchor points with nearly all of the mobile homes in the Stony Brook mobile home park sustained some type of damage.  The EF2 tornado continued to move northeast across Buffalo Road, near the Cardinal Grove Subdivision. Several two story homes were completely destroyed with numerous other homes sustaining moderate to major damage. Damage consistent with an EF2 tornado continued with widespread damage in a 200 yard wide swath along Forestville road. A couple of mobile homes were destroyed and several two story homes suffered extensive roof damage, with continued numerous snapped trees falling on houses.

This epic event broke the record for number of tornadoes in a day for the state of Alabama, becoming the most significant tornado outbreak in the state���s history. ||Central Alabama had two rounds of severe weather that day. During the early morning hours, a Quasi-Linear Convective System quickly moved across the northern half of the National Weather Service, Birmingham county warning area. Straight line winds of 90 mph (78kts) or greater and 11 tornadoes lead to widespread damage and power outages. During the afternoon, long-lived supercell thunderstorms produced long-track, strong and violent tornadoes. Destruction and loss of life across many towns and communities was devastating. ||The hardest hit areas included Shottsville and Hackleburg, both in Marion County, where winds of 160 mph and 210 mph respectively, caused unimagineable damage. Cordova, in Walker County, was hit twice; by a tornado along the Quasi-Linear Convective System during the early morning hours and again in the afternoon by a long-track EF4 tornado. A long track tornado moved across the city of Tuscaloosa and the western suburbs of Birmingham, resulting in the complete destruction of whole neighborhoods and numerous injuries and fatalities in those heavily populated areas. The same parent supercell produced another violent tornado in east Central Alabama as it tracked across St. Clair and Calhoun Counties, resulting in additional fatalities and incredible damage to a number of neighborhoods. Another violent EF4 tornado tracked across portions of Elmore and Tallapoosa Counties, including Lake Martin, destroying numerous homes and a large section of a mobile home park. ||Most of the violent tornadoes from this day were captured on video by a number of people, including storm spotters and chasers, as well as numerous television news crews and remotely controlled web-enabled video cameras.  This allowed unprecedented coverage and viewing of this historic event in real time from people worldwide.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado initially touched down in rural northern Greene County and moved northeast through southern Tuscaloosa and western Jefferson Counties, causing devastating damage consistent with a violent EF4 rating to portions of the city of Tuscaloosa and western suburbs of Birmingham, before it lifted northeast of downtown Birmingham. The tornado entered Tuscaloosa County just north of CR 60, west northwest of Ralph, and moved northeast causing tree damage and minor structural damage consistent with an EF2 rating and winds of 125 mph. The tornado strengthened as it crossed the Black Warrior River, north of Interstate 20 and approached Tuscaloosa. As the tornado approached Interstate 359, several buildings were destroyed including the Tuscaloosa County Emergency Operations Center. The tornado strengthened further to a violent EF4 with winds of 190 mph. Along 15th St E. and McFarland Blvd E., several small restaurants and stores were destroyed, with only a wall or two still standing. The tornado devastated the Cedar Crest neighborhood just north of 15th St, leveling many cinder block homes and causing at least 3 fatalities. The tornado crossed McFarland Blvd, destroying additional stores and restaurants. The tornado crossed University Blvd in the Alberta City community. Alberta Elementary School suffered nearly complete destruction, with only a few portions of walls still standing. A nearby two story apartment building was reduced to rubble sitting on the foundation. The Alberta Park Shopping Center was completely destroyed with no walls standing and a pile of debris on the foundation. Cinder block construction homes in the surrounding neighborhood were completely destroyed, and in a few cases debris was swept away from the site. The tornado continued northeast and struck the Chastain Manor Apartments at the north end of 34th Ave E. Buildings on the east side of this new 2 story apartment complex were completely destroyed, with only a pile of debris remaining and a few walls set into the hillside. A small club house that was anchored to a foundation, but with apparently no interior walls, was completely destroyed and swept from its foundation. Similar devastation to homes and businesses was noted along both sides of CR 45 near 1st St E. and locations to the northeastward. East of Holt, the tornado path width widened from 0.5 mile to around 1 mile. The tornado crossed Holt Peterson Rd just northwest of Clinker Rd, where two homes were completely destroyed. One home on a foundation was swept clean, with only floor joists remaining attached to the foundation. Almost all trees were blown down or snapped in the vicinity, as well as in the bottom of a narrow ravine nearly 100 feet below the house. The tornado continued to Holt Lock and Dam Road near its intersection with Recreation Area Road. Numerous mobile homes and several cinder block homes were destroyed in this area, which resulted in several fatalities. The tornado struck a marina on Holt Lake at the end of Recreation Area Road where it caused significant damage to a restaurant as well as numerous boats. Several injuries were noted in this area. The tornado continued northeastward and weakened to an EF3 rating with winds of 130 mph. As its path narrowed to 0.5 mile, the tornado passed north of Brookwood, near the intersection of Hannah Creek Rd and CR 59. Several mobile homes were destroyed, cinder block homes received heavy damage, and significant tree damage was noted in this area. The tornado moved parallel to Hannah Creek Rd where it caused extensive tree damage and destroyed at least one mobile home. The tornado crossed CR 99 and moved into western Jefferson County, 4 miles north of Abernant. A person died (indirect) several weeks after the event as a result of contracting pneumonia from exposure to the elements after his home was destroyed. An additional 6 people died (indirect) in the months following the tornado from the stress of the event, not direct injury.||This tornado was produced by a supercell thunderstorm that began in Newton County Mississippi at 13:54 pm CST, finally dissipating in Macon County, North Carolina at approximately 21:18 pm CST.

This epic event broke the record for number of tornadoes in a day for the state of Alabama, becoming the most significant tornado outbreak in the state���s history. ||Central Alabama had two rounds of severe weather that day. During the early morning hours, a Quasi-Linear Convective System quickly moved across the northern half of the National Weather Service, Birmingham county warning area. Straight line winds of 90 mph (78kts) or greater and 11 tornadoes lead to widespread damage and power outages. During the afternoon, long-lived supercell thunderstorms produced long-track, strong and violent tornadoes. Destruction and loss of life across many towns and communities was devastating. ||The hardest hit areas included Shottsville and Hackleburg, both in Marion County, where winds of 160 mph and 210 mph respectively, caused unimagineable damage. Cordova, in Walker County, was hit twice; by a tornado along the Quasi-Linear Convective System during the early morning hours and again in the afternoon by a long-track EF4 tornado.

The tornado continued into Franklin County and tracked through Lawrence, Morgan, Limestone, and Madison Counties in Alabama. The tornado continued into Lincoln County Tennessee and finally dissipated in Franklin County Tennessee (See Storm Data Huntsville). The average path width of the tornado while in Marion County was 0.5 mile (880 yds).  The tornado touched down west of AL Hwy 19 near Sipsey Creek and moved northeast and crossed Corridor X/Future Interstate 22. Here it caused significant tree damage. The tornado strengthened north of Hamilton and caused roof damage to at least one home. The storm strengthened further as it approached US Hwy 43, southwest of Hackleburg, to a violent EF4 rating with winds estimated at 170 mph. The tornado tracked parallel to US Hwy 43 toward Hackleburg and strengthened more to an EF5 with winds up to 210 mph, as its path widened to 0.75 mile (1320 yds). Several subdivisions and businesses, Hackleburg High School, Middle School, and Elementary School, and the Wrangler Plant were destroyed. Vehicles were tossed up to 200 yards. One well built home with 4 brick sides was completely leveled and the debris from the home was tossed over 40 yards to the north. The tornado moved northeast of Hackleburg and  continued to parallel US Hwy 43. It crossed into Franklin County just east of the highway. Along the damage path in Marion County, thousands of trees were downed, several hundred structures were damaged, and at least 100 of these structures were completely destroyed as many homes were leveled.

This epic event broke the record for number of tornadoes in a day for the state of Alabama, becoming the most significant tornado outbreak in the state���s history. ||Central Alabama had two rounds of severe weather that day. During the early morning hours, a Quasi-Linear Convective System quickly moved across the northern half of the National Weather Service, Birmingham county warning area. Straight line winds of 90 mph (78kts) or greater and 11 tornadoes lead to widespread damage and power outages. During the afternoon, long-lived supercell thunderstorms produced long-track, strong and violent tornadoes. Destruction and loss of life across many towns and communities was devastating. ||The hardest hit areas included Shottsville and Hackleburg, both in Marion County, where winds of 160 mph and 210 mph respectively, caused unimagineable damage. Cordova, in Walker County, was hit twice; by a tornado along the Quasi-Linear Convective System during the early morning hours and again in the afternoon by a long-track EF4 tornado. A long track tornado moved across the city of Tuscaloosa and the western suburbs of Birmingham, resulting in the complete destruction of whole neighborhoods and numerous injuries and fatalities in those heavily populated areas. The same parent supercell produced another violent tornado in east Central Alabama as it tracked across St. Clair and Calhoun Counties, resulting in additional fatalities and incredible damage to a number of neighborhoods. Another violent EF4 tornado tracked across portions of Elmore and Tallapoosa Counties, including Lake Martin, destroying numerous homes and a large section of a mobile home park. ||Most of the violent tornadoes from this day were captured on video by a number of people, including storm spotters and chasers, as well as numerous television news crews and remotely controlled web-enabled video cameras.

The tornado continued into Franklin County and tracked through Lawrence, Morgan, Limestone, and Madison Counties in Alabama. The tornado continued into Lincoln County Tennessee and finally dissipated in Franklin County Tennessee (See Storm Data Huntsville). The average path width of the tornado while in Marion County was 0.5 mile (880 yds).  The tornado touched down west of AL Hwy 19 near Sipsey Creek and moved northeast and crossed Corridor X/Future Interstate 22. Here it caused significant tree damage. The tornado strengthened north of Hamilton and caused roof damage to at least one home. The storm strengthened further as it approached US Hwy 43, southwest of Hackleburg, to a violent EF4 rating with winds estimated at 170 mph. The tornado tracked parallel to US Hwy 43 toward Hackleburg and strengthened more to an EF5 with winds up to 210 mph, as its path widened to 0.75 mile (1320 yds). Several subdivisions and businesses, Hackleburg High School, Middle School, and Elementary School, and the Wrangler Plant were destroyed. Vehicles were tossed up to 200 yards. One well built home with 4 brick sides was completely leveled and the debris from the home was tossed over 40 yards to the north. The tornado moved northeast of Hackleburg and  continued to parallel US Hwy 43. It crossed into Franklin County just east of the highway. Along the damage path in Marion County, thousands of trees were downed, several hundred structures were damaged, and at least 100 of these structures were completely destroyed as many homes were leveled. Eighteen fatalities are attributed to this tornado in Marion County, as well as numerous injuries.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 160.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado intensified to EF3 with winds estimated up to 160 mph southwest of Snow Hill. The tornado continued at EF3 intensity as it crossed Highway 13 just west of Snow Hill. Numerous homes and businesses were severely damaged or destroyed in this area with some almost completely flattened. Numerous vehicles were also destroyed. The strong EF3 tornado continued as it moved north of Snow Hill and severely damaged the Greene County middle school where the roof was torn off. The tornado continued to produce EF3 damage as it moved along Albriton Road where large metal power poles were bent over or completely ripped out of the ground. The tornado finally began to weaken as it passed Taylor road and dissipated near Tysons Church Road. In all about 30 million dollars of damage occurred in Greene County.

Several powerful super-cell thunderstorms developed ahead of an approaching cold front. Conditions ahead of the front were favorable for tornadoes with a moderately unstable atmosphere combined with strong winds that veered with height. Altogether 12 tornadoes were reported across the Newport/Morehead City county warning area. These tornadoes combined to produce over 40 million dollars in damages. There were numerous injuries but no fatalities were reported. In addition to the tornadoes there were several reports of damaging winds and large hail.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the second segment for the tornado that originally spun up in Lenoir County. The tornado moved into Greene county just west of Highway 903. The tornado produced mainly EF0 and EF1 damage across the southern part of Greene County with damage to trees and a few homes. The tornado intensified to EF3 with winds estimated up to 160 mph southwest of Snow Hill. The tornado continued at EF3 intensity as it crossed Highway 13 just west of Snow Hill. Numerous homes and businesses were severely damaged or destroyed in this area with some almost completely flattened. Numerous vehicles were also destroyed. The strong EF3 tornado continued as it moved north of Snow Hill and severely damaged the Greene County middle school where the roof was torn off. The tornado continued to produce EF3 damage as it moved along Albriton Road where large metal power poles were bent over or completely ripped out of the ground. The tornado finally began to weaken as it passed Taylor road and dissipated near Tysons Church Road. In all about 30 million dollars of damage occurred in Greene County. There were numerous injures, 2 serious. There were no fatalities.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 30.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

By the end of the day, one EF-5, two EF-4, and two EF-3 tornadoes destroyed buildings, ripped up trees and power poles, and unfortunately, resulted in 11 deaths. The day began with a strong upper level trough ejecting out of the southwest United States. The trough took on a negative tilt as it approached the southern Plains. A strong jet stream was located at both the middle and upper levels rotating around the upper trough.

Strong low-level rotation developed early, with the first tornado occurring over Blaine county, and moved northeast into Major county. Another supercell rapidly gained low-level rotation as it moved from Caddo into Canadian County. This tornado became the strongest of them all as it moved north of El Reno, west of Piedmont, and to south of Guthrie in Logan county. Nine people died as a result of this tornado. Two more powerful supercells developed over Grady county, and they moved northeast into McClain and Cleveland counties. Finally, the final tornado occurred east of Norman into Pottawatomie county.

The tornado weakened and narrowed as it crossed CR 410. Even though the tornado had weakened, EF-2 to EF-3 damage was still occurring as it approached Highway 39. The tornado increased in intensity once again near the Highway, with EF-4 damage surveyed for the 2nd time. Well constructed homes were destroyed, with several wiped clean off of their foundations. This also began a longer streak of higher end damage, with EF-3 to EF-4 damage occurring until it crossed Highway 74B, west of High Avenue. Equally devastating destruction occurred over the areas of EF-4 damage. The tornado lifted west of Goldsby with still EF-3 damage occurring prior to lifting.

As these storms lifted northward and rotated around the surface area of low pressure, they would rapidly begin to rotate, as they reached the enhanced winds near the warm front.

This epic event broke the record for number of tornadoes in a day for the state of Alabama, becoming the most significant tornado outbreak in the state���s history. ||Central Alabama had two rounds of severe weather that day. During the early morning hours, a Quasi-Linear Convective System quickly moved across the northern half of the National Weather Service, Birmingham county warning area. Straight line winds of 90 mph (78kts) or greater and 11 tornadoes lead to widespread damage and power outages. During the afternoon, long-lived supercell thunderstorms produced long-track, strong and violent tornadoes. Destruction and loss of life across many towns and communities was devastating. ||The hardest hit areas included Shottsville and Hackleburg, both in Marion County, where winds of 160 mph and 210 mph respectively, caused unimagineable damage. Cordova, in Walker County, was hit twice; by a tornado along the Quasi-Linear Convective System during the early morning hours and again in the afternoon by a long-track EF4 tornado. A long track tornado moved across the city of Tuscaloosa and the western suburbs of Birmingham, resulting in the complete destruction of whole neighborhoods and numerous injuries and fatalities in those heavily populated areas. The same parent supercell produced another violent tornado in east Central Alabama as it tracked across St. Clair and Calhoun Counties, resulting in additional fatalities and incredible damage to a number of neighborhoods. Another violent EF4 tornado tracked across portions of Elmore and Tallapoosa Counties, including Lake Martin, destroying numerous homes and a large section of a mobile home park. ||Most of the violent tornadoes from this day were captured on video by a number of people, including storm spotters and chasers, as well as numerous television news crews and remotely controlled web-enabled video cameras.  This allowed unprecedented coverage and viewing of this historic event in real time from people worldwide.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado initially touched down in southwest Marion County, near the community of Pikeville and tracked northeast where it moved across southern portions of Haleyville and into Winston County, south of AL Route 129. The tornado lifted in the William B. Bankhead National Forest, north of Rabbittown. The tornado moved into western Winston County and caused extensive damage to businesses near the intersection of CR 75 and Dolphin Rd. As the tornado crossed southern portions of Haleyville, many homes were significantly damaged and several were destroyed. This damage was consistent with an EF3 rating and winds of 150 mph. The tornado continued to produce tree damage as it entered the Bankhead National Forest area in northern Winston County, lifting along CR 3434.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 11.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This epic event broke the record for number of tornadoes in a day for the state of Alabama, becoming the most significant tornado outbreak in the state���s history. ||Central Alabama had two rounds of severe weather that day. During the early morning hours, a Quasi-Linear Convective System quickly moved across the northern half of the National Weather Service, Birmingham county warning area. Straight line winds of 90 mph (78kts) or greater and 11 tornadoes lead to widespread damage and power outages. During the afternoon, long-lived supercell thunderstorms produced long-track, strong and violent tornadoes. Destruction and loss of life across many towns and communities was devastating. ||The hardest hit areas included Shottsville and Hackleburg, both in Marion County, where winds of 160 mph and 210 mph respectively, caused unimagineable damage. Cordova, in Walker County, was hit twice; by a tornado along the Quasi-Linear Convective System during the early morning hours and again in the afternoon by a long-track EF4 tornado. A long track tornado moved across the city of Tuscaloosa and the western suburbs of Birmingham, resulting in the complete destruction of whole neighborhoods and numerous injuries and fatalities in those heavily populated areas. The same parent supercell produced another violent tornado in east Central Alabama as it tracked across St. Clair and Calhoun Counties, resulting in additional fatalities and incredible damage to a number of neighborhoods. Another violent EF4 tornado tracked across portions of Elmore and Tallapoosa Counties, including Lake Martin, destroying numerous homes and a large section of a mobile home park. ||Most of the violent tornadoes from this day were captured on video by a number of people, including storm spotters and chasers, as well as numerous television news crews and remotely controlled web-enabled video cameras.  This allowed unprecedented coverage and viewing of this historic event in real time from people worldwide.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado initially touched down in southwest Marion County, near the community of Pikeville and tracked northeast where it moved across southern portions of Haleyville and into Winston County, south of AL Route 129. The tornado lifted in the William B. Bankhead National Forest, north of Rabbittown. The tornado moved into western Winston County and caused extensive damage to businesses near the intersection of CR 75 and Dolphin Rd. As the tornado crossed southern portions of Haleyville, many homes were significantly damaged and several were destroyed. This damage was consistent with an EF3 rating and winds of 150 mph. The tornado continued to produce tree damage as it entered the Bankhead National Forest area in northern Winston County, lifting along CR 3434.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 11.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The most severe damage occurred on either side of U.S. Highway 231 north of Arab -- particularly in the Ruth community and along Hog Jaw Road -- about 3 miles north of Arab.  Along Hog Jaw Road, a large storage shed with farm equipment was destroyed with some of the large machinery tossed 10 to 20 yards around the shed.  In the Ruth community, Mount Oak and Frontier Roads were hardest hit where a cinder block/cement home was nearly wiped clean.  Debris from a home on Frontier Road was thrown 50 to 100 yards away.  A family of 9 was in this house and 5 were killed. A trailer was missing and a metal-bolted garage was wiped clean of its foundation.  Along Frontier Road, a large brick home was nearly wiped clean off its foundation with several large trees ripped out of the ground and missing.  Further northeast along the path, along Walnut Ridge, a one-story home was severely damaged with the roof missing and a trailer that was tossed into a tree.  Several concrete power poles were bent over as the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 231, some bent at the base.  One the east side of Highway 231, a gas station building was completely demolished and two gas pumps were ripped from the ground and missing. The canopy over the pumps remained mostly intact.||The tornado continued toward Union Grove.  The degree of damage weakened somewhat but several homes had significant damage where the top stories and roofs were destroyed and the external walls had collapsed.  Along County Road 240, a double-wide manufactured home was destroyed and a large garage collapsed but the well-built roof remained intact.||The tornado significantly weakened as it crossed the Tennessee River.

Hope area where significant devastation was incurred to single family homes and a restaurant.  Nothing but the foundation and a pile of debris remained in this area, and a small portion of the restaurant foundation buckled.  Thousands of hardwood and softwood trees were snapped, with a significant number of trees twisted and debarked with only stubs of branches remaining.  Many mobile homes were also destroyed with the frames mangled, and a single family home was completely destroyed with the walls and contents strewn over a hundred yards.  Further northeast the damage was slightly less intense, with more trees snapped and twisted as the tornado reached Highway 24.  At this location multiple chicken houses were completely destroyed with much of the debris wrapped around debarked trees.  TVA high voltage power line trusses were also destroyed at this location.  As the tornado continued northeast more significant damage occurred in and around the Langtown community north of Moulton.  On the west side of Alabama Highway 33, several homes sustained significant damage with roofs missing or only interior rooms remaining.  A nearby store and gas station also sustained significant damage.  The tornado strengthened again to a high end EF-4 as it moved over County Roads 214 and 298, where multiple houses and mobile homes were completely destroyed.  Several cars were tossed into fields and wrapped around trees along County Road 291 and 292.  One vehicle was tossed into a large hardwood tree that was also debarked.  Tree and mobile home damage continued along County Roads 217 and 222, where a handful of large high tension TVA power poles were destroyed.

By the end of the day, one EF-5, two EF-4, and two EF-3 tornadoes destroyed buildings, ripped up trees and power poles, and unfortunately, resulted in 11 deaths. The day began with a strong upper level trough ejecting out of the southwest United States. The trough took on a negative tilt as it approached the southern Plains. A strong jet stream was located at both the middle and upper levels rotating around the upper trough. At the surface, a low pressure strengthened rapidly over northwest Oklahoma, keeping the low-level flow of warm, moist air to flow east of a dry line that had moved into western Oklahoma. Thunderstorms developed by early afternoon over western Oklahoma, and quickly became supercellular as they moved northeast. Strong low-level rotation developed early, with the first tornado occurring over Blaine county, and moved northeast into Major county. Another supercell rapidly gained low-level rotation as it moved from Caddo into Canadian County. This tornado became the strongest of them all as it moved north of El Reno, west of Piedmont, and to south of Guthrie in Logan county. Nine people died as a result of this tornado. Two more powerful supercells developed over Grady county, and they moved northeast into McClain and Cleveland counties. Finally, the final tornado occurred east of Norman into Pottawatomie county.

The tornado destroyed several manufactured homes (both double- and single-wide) after entering Logan county. Large high-transmission line tresses collapsed. Trees were debarked with only stumps remaining. Several buildings had most of their exterior walls collapse, with only the inner walls remaining. EF-2 to occasionally EF-3 damage occurred as the tornado neared Guthrie. Luckily, most of the town of Guthrie was spared to the tornado as it moved west and then north of the center of the city. Finally, the tornado dissipated northeast of Guthrie with some minor tree damage. After it was all said and done, the tornado continued for 63 miles, and lasted around an hour and 45 minutes.

By the end of the day, one EF-5, two EF-4, and two EF-3 tornadoes destroyed buildings, ripped up trees and power poles, and unfortunately, resulted in 11 deaths. The day began with a strong upper level trough ejecting out of the southwest United States. The trough took on a negative tilt as it approached the southern Plains. A strong jet stream was located at both the middle and upper levels rotating around the upper trough. At the surface, a low pressure strengthened rapidly over northwest Oklahoma, keeping the low-level flow of warm, moist air to flow east of a dry line that had moved into western Oklahoma. Thunderstorms developed by early afternoon over western Oklahoma, and quickly became supercellular as they moved northeast. Strong low-level rotation developed early, with the first tornado occurring over Blaine county, and moved northeast into Major county. Another supercell rapidly gained low-level rotation as it moved from Caddo into Canadian County. This tornado became the strongest of them all as it moved north of El Reno, west of Piedmont, and to south of Guthrie in Logan county. Nine people died as a result of this tornado. Two more powerful supercells developed over Grady county, and they moved northeast into McClain and Cleveland counties. Finally, the final tornado occurred east of Norman into Pottawatomie county. The timing of this outbreak could not have come at a worse time, as rush hour was just unfolding as the tornadoes neared the Oklahoma City metro area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado is labeled B2 (Segment #2 of Calumet-El Reno-Piedmont-Guthrie tornado). The tornado entered far southeast Kingfisher county before moving into Logan county. However, EF-3 damage occurred just over the Kingfisher county border, debarking trees and significantly damaging buildings. As the tornado continued northeast, the damage was mainly considered EF-2, with damage to mostly outbuildings and trees. The tornado continued into Logan County. Monetary damage estimates were not available.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong maritime-Pacific (mP) cold front accompanied the upper trough through the mid-south into the southeast from the early morning hours of the 27th to the early morning hours of the 28th.  An intense low-level jet with winds in excess of 70 knots was noted in advance of this system and tracked across the mid-south early on the 27th, across north Alabama and north Georgia into the early morning hours of the 28th.  West-southwest winds aloft were highly diffluent and near 200 mph across this same region.  The strong low-level jet brought unseasonably, warm, moist Gulf air northward in advance of the mP cold front.  Dewpoints in the 70s and maximum temperatures in the 80s combined with the extremely strong low-level and upper jets to create an almost perfect environment for severe thunderstorms and large devastating tornadoes.  Indeed, the tornado outbreak that affected much of the eastern U.S., but particularly the south central and southeastern U.S. during this period, was unprecedented and likely the largest recorded in U.S. history.  The tornado outbreak that accompanied this combination of weather features has been termed the 2011 Super Outbreak, an outbreak even worse than the 1994 and 1974 super tornado outbreaks across the eastern U.S.  The outbreak affected the South Central, Southeast, Midwest, and even the usually less tornado prone Northeastern United States.  Over 330 tornadoes were reported during this outbreak which began on April 25th and continued into the 28th affecting 21 states from Texas to New York.  Even isolated tornadoes were noted in Canada.  Nearly 350 people died from these tornadoes, of which over 230 of these were in Alabama alone.  Four tornadoes on April 27th in Alabama and Mississippi were ranked EF5, the highest tornado damage rating on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.  On average, there is only one EF5 tornado per year in the entire U.S.||Widespread and destructive tornadoes occurred on each day of the outbreak, but April 27th was clearly one of the most prolific and destructive tornado days in U.S. history, probably only surpassed by the Tri-State outbreak of 1925 and the Tupelo-Gainesville outbreak of 1936.  The 24-hour period from 8 am April 27th to 8 a.m. April 28th is listed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as the fourth deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history, with the 24 hours commencing April 28th at 8 a.m. as the fifth deadliest tornado day in U.S. history.  It has also been determined to be the costliest tornado outbreaks and one of the costliest natural disasters in the U.S., even after adjustments for inflation, with total damages estimated to exceed $10 billion. ||Georgia was heavily impacted by this tornado outbreak, especially the northwest part of the state which bore the brunt of the massive supercell thunderstorms producing killer tornadoes that tracked east-northeast from northern Alabama during the late evening.  All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City confirmed that the tornado, which originally touched down in far southeast Pike county and continued moving northeast across Lamar county, causing extensive damage and two fatalities there, continued across northern Monroe county before finally moving into extreme southeast Butts county and lifting.  The tornado weakened from an EF3 in Lamar county to an EF2 as it crossed northern Monroe county, then to an EF0 as it briefly crossed into Butts county.  Within Monroe county the tornado path length was just over 11 miles.  The maximum path width continued at 0.6 mile with maximum winds at 140 mph.  Just after the tornado crossed into Monroe county, it crossed Interstate-75 near mile marker 196, where three 18-wheel tractor-trailers were blown off the interstate.  Several homes suffered minor to moderate damage.  A total of four homes were destroyed, 19 others suffered major damage, with 25 sustaining minor damage.  Most of the damage homes were near High Falls State Park and Blount.  While there were no fatalities within Monroe county from this tornado, 10 injuries were reported from the damaged and destroyed homes.||[04/27-04/28/11: Tornado #12, County #3-4, EF3, Pike-Lamar-Monroe-Butts, 2011:021].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

All together, there were 15 tornadoes affecting 28 counties within the Peachtree City, Georgia 96-county warning area (CWA) of North and Central Georgia.  All of these occurred within a 24-hour period commencing at 8 am April 27th.  One of these tornadoes was rated an EF4, the first EF4 tornado in Georgia since the Palm Sunday outbreak in 1994.  In addition, there were also four EF3 tornadoes.  Fifteen tornado-related deaths were observed in north and central Georgia, the most tornado-related deaths within the Peachtree City, Georgia forecast area since its inception in 1994.  The previous highest tornado-related death total was 12 on March 20, 1998, when a tornado struck Gainesville, Georgia.||Finally, it should be noted that while the most significant period of severe weather during this outbreak for Georgia was from the afternoon of the 27th through the early morning hours of the 28th, there was an initial round of severe weather across northwest Georgia early on the 27th as a decaying line of severe thunderstorms moved into the region from northeast Alabama.  Widespread wind damage and even a few brief weaker tornadoes accompanied this system into the northwest counties of the state.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Forecast Office in Peachtree City confirmed that the tornado, which originally touched down in far southeast Pike county and continued moving northeast across Lamar county, causing extensive damage and two fatalities there, continued across northern Monroe county before finally moving into extreme southeast Butts county and lifting.  The tornado weakened from an EF3 in Lamar county to an EF2 as it crossed northern Monroe county, then to an EF0 as it briefly crossed into Butts county.  Within Monroe county the tornado path length was just over 11 miles.  The maximum path width continued at 0.6 mile with maximum winds at 140 mph.  Just after the tornado crossed into Monroe county, it crossed Interstate-75 near mile marker 196, where three 18-wheel tractor-trailers were blown off the interstate.  Several homes suffered minor to moderate damage.  A total of four homes were destroyed, 19 others suffered major damage, with 25 sustaining minor damage.  Most of the damage homes were near High Falls State Park and Blount.  While there were no fatalities within Monroe county from this tornado, 10 injuries were reported from the damaged and destroyed homes.||[04/27-04/28/11: Tornado #12, County #3-4, EF3, Pike-Lamar-Monroe-Butts, 2011:021].<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Along a line connecting these areas tracked an EF5 tornado with peak winds around 210 mph, the strongest and most violent on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. ||Other areas impacted by the storms include the city of Cullman, where extensive damage occurred to buildings in the downtown area, and to the town of Fairview, both of which are located in Cullman County. Downstream, further significant damage occurred to the Ruth and Oak Grove communities in Marshall County. In addition, the communities of Rainsville and Sylvania along with the towns of Henagar and Ider in DeKalb County were severely impacted. Fatalities in DeKalb County alone numbered at least 33 people. Furthermore, the towns of Flat Rock, Higdon and Pisgah in Jackson County sustained incredible damage. The tornadoes that affected these areas were rated as an EF4 with maximum winds near 190 mph.||In most of these areas alone, numerous people lost their lives. These represent just several of the communities and towns impacted by the events of April 27, 2011. While the majority of the analysis and survey work conducted by the National Weather Service, Huntsville and its partners have been completed, there will undoubtedly be countless research studies conducted by both academia and operational personnel in order to further evaluate and understand the complex processes associated with this near unprecedented severe weather outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A violent long track tornado developed on the north side of Lewis Smith Lake along County Road 310 where some light damage was found.  The tornado tracked northeast snapping numerous large trees and causing significant structural damage to residences along County Roads 222 and 436 near Grandview.  The tornado tracked northeast into the city of Cullman.  Some of the worst damage occurred just northeast of U.S. Highways 31 and 278.  Several small retail buildings were completely destroyed. along with the near total destruction of a large church.  The tornado tracked across State Highway 157, then caused additional damage north of State Highway 69 between Simcoe and Pleasant View.  Just north of Fairview along County Roads 1559 and 1564, 2 homes were destroyed with significant portions of the homes not found.  Further northeast along County Road 1589, the tornado caused major structural damage to several old (early 1900s) homes.  Numerous hardwood trees were debarked.

In addition, the communities of Rainsville and Sylvania along with the towns of Henagar and Ider in DeKalb County were severely impacted. Fatalities in DeKalb County alone numbered at least 33 people. Furthermore, the towns of Flat Rock, Higdon and Pisgah in Jackson County sustained incredible damage. The tornadoes that affected these areas were rated as an EF4 with maximum winds near 190 mph.||In most of these areas alone, numerous people lost their lives. These represent just several of the communities and towns impacted by the events of April 27, 2011. While the majority of the analysis and survey work conducted by the National Weather Service, Huntsville and its partners have been completed, there will undoubtedly be countless research studies conducted by both academia and operational personnel in order to further evaluate and understand the complex processes associated with this near unprecedented severe weather outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A violent long track tornado developed on the north side of Lewis Smith Lake along County Road 310 where some light damage was found.  The tornado tracked northeast snapping numerous large trees and causing significant structural damage to residences along County Roads 222 and 436 near Grandview.  The tornado tracked northeast into the city of Cullman.  Some of the worst damage occurred just northeast of U.S. Highways 31 and 278.  Several small retail buildings were completely destroyed. along with the near total destruction of a large church.  The tornado tracked across State Highway 157, then caused additional damage north of State Highway 69 between Simcoe and Pleasant View.  Just north of Fairview along County Roads 1559 and 1564, 2 homes were destroyed with significant portions of the homes not found.  Further northeast along County Road 1589, the tornado caused major structural damage to several old (early 1900s) homes.  Numerous hardwood trees were debarked.  A 1/4 to 1/2 mile wide corridor of significant damage persisted between Fairview and the Morgan County line.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5.

This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado caused a path of extensive damage in northeast Neshoba, extreme northwest Kemper, extreme southeast Winston, and southwest Noxubee Counties. The most intense damage occurred in a several mile area from extreme northeast Neshoba County into extreme southeast Winston County. Much of the damage in the core of the tornado in this area was rated as high end EF-3 to EF-5. The three fatalities occurred in northwest Kemper County when a strapped down double-wide mobile home was thrown a distance of approximately 300 yards into a treeline, and then obliterated with the debris and framing scattered many hundreds of yards down the path. There was no indication of ground impacts between the original site of the mobile home and where it ended up to indicate that the mobile home bounced extensively as it traveled. Two traditional frame brick homes in southeast Winston County were completely leveled with only a few small parts of interior walls standing. New vehicles were thrown or rolled hundreds of yards before being wrapped into trees and left almost beyond recognition. In parts of northeast Neshoba and northwest Kemper Counties, there was very high end tree damage with extensive denuding and debarking of trees, along with areas where the ground was scoured out to a depth of two feet in places, and asphalt was scoured off pavement. Maximum sustained winds were estimated at 205 mph. Total path length was 29 miles.||This was the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966.

About 100,000 people were evacuated from the Atlantic Coast. Numerous roadways were flooded and closed and thousands of trees were knocked down. About 100,000 utility customers lost power. In addition, chickens were killed by flooding and agricultural crops were damaged by the flooding. Delaware received federal disaster declaration.  ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread Delaware during the afternoon of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 60 mph. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th. The second peak occurred during the late morning and early afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. The rain associated with Irene overspread the state between 7 a.m. EDT and Noon EDT on the 27th, fell at its heaviest from the late afternoon of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended around Noon EDT on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 12 inches and caused widespread and in some instances record breaking flooding. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all stormdata flooding related county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 4 feet caused minor to moderate tidal flooding along tidal sections of the Delaware River and in Upper Delaware Bay and moderate to severe tidal flooding along lower Delaware Bay and along the coast during the evening high tide cycle on the 27th. The winds shifted to the northwest during the morning high tide cycle on the 28th.  ||Governor Jack Markell ordered visitors to evacuate the Delaware beaches effective 6 pm EDT on August 25th. In addition, a state of emergency was declared and shelters were opened throughout the state on August 26th. Driving restrictions were in place. Mandatory evacuations of approximately one hundred thousand tourists and residents occurred, including special populations, began on Thursday, August 25th. The Cape May���Lewes Ferry suspended service for August 27th and 28th. Toll operations on Delaware State Route 1 were halted. Transit services were shut down on August 27th and 28th, while most of the bridges over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and the Indian River were closed due to the wind.||About 100,000 utility customers lost power at the peak of the storm. Power was not fully restored until August 31st. Schools were dismissed early on Friday the 26th and remained closed through the duration of the event. The state highway department reported over two hundred roads under water. Seven bridges sustained structural damage. At least thirty-seven homes and businesses sustained major damage or were destroyed. Extensive damage occurred to the six state maintained beaches as severe beach erosion and dune breaches occurred. The combination of heavy rain and severe tidal flooding washed out Prime Hook Road along Delaware Bay in Cedar Creek Hundred (Sussex County). In Kent County, tidal flooding occurred along Kitts Hummock Road as well as along Bowers Beach. | |The highest wind gusts recorded during Hurricane Irene were 66 mph in Lewes (Sussex County), 64 mph in Dewey Beach (Sussex County), 60 mph in Georgetown (Sussex County), 57 mph in Wilmington (New Castle County), and 52 mph in Dover (Kent County). The highest tides included 8.20 feet above mean lower low water at Breakwater Harbor in Sussex County (severe flooding starts at 8.0 feet above mean lower low water) and 8.03 feet above mean lower low water at Reedy Island in New Castle County. Minor tidal flooding at Reedy starts at 7.2 feet above mean lower low water.||Hurricane Irene formed east of the Leeward Islands on Saturday the 20th. It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th and then proceeded to the northnortheast and went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. Irene then paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th. Irene made her second landfall as a tropical storm on Brigantine Island, just north of Atlantic City, New Jersey at 535 a.m. EDT on the 28th. From there the center of Irene moved along eastern parts of Ocean and Monmouth Counties and was located near Tinton Falls Township in Monmouth County at 8 a.m. EDT on the 28th. At about 9 a.m. EDT the center of Irene passed over New York City.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

For most of this time the wave was nearly surrounded by dry air and with enough vertical wind shear to ensure that any intensification would be slow. Its forward speed of 20 mph somewhat aided the shear in keeping it weak. Irene made landfall over mainland Puerto Rico at 125 am AST on August 22, near Punta Santiago then Luis Munoz Marin International Airport at San Juan recorded its highest wind gust of 59 mph at 218 am AST.  At 300 am AST (0700 UTC) the center was estimated to be 10 miles southwest of San Juan with 70 mph sustained winds, mainly over the Atlantic waters north of the city.||By 500 am AST doppler radar had indicated winds sustained up to 72 knots (83 mph) only 500 to 600 feet above the water. Irene was then officially upgraded to a hurricane though a hurricane warning had already been issued for the region. With the hurricane center moving offshore about this time the strongest winds (north of the center) also moved away from shore. At 536 am AST the buoy near Arecibo recorded its highest wind gust of 37 knots (43 mph). At 900 am AST the center of Irene was directly north of the west coast of Puerto Rico but the hurricane force winds were well offshore with an obviously developing eye on radar.||Puerto Rico was under the effects of Tropical Cyclone Irene from early Sunday August 22 through late Wednesday August 24. Irene made landfall as a tropical storm during the early morning hours of Monday August 22, intensified overland and became a hurricane over northern Puerto Rico around 500 am Monday, before exiting into the Atlantic later that morning. Irene���s most siginificant impact was the heavy rainfall. The first rainbands entered eastern Puerto Rico early on Sunday and persisted through midnight on Wednesday, although additional rainfall was received across some of the east municipalities through Thursday morning August 25. Locations like Gurabo across eastern interior Puerto Rico experienced significant 48 hour rainfall accumulations, with an estimated return period of around 50 years.||Shortly after Irene���s center passed by San Juan on August 22 there were 800,000 homes without electric power and 118,000 without water service. The storm surge from Irene, as expected, was very minor. The highest surges measured were at Esperanza (Vieques) and Fajardo and reached 1.6 feet between 100 am and 200 am (0506z and 0530z respectively). This was during the time that the center of Irene was moving inland over Eastern Puerto Rico.||Damage from flooding was extensive across the region from Irene, however, though wind caused widespread damage it was relatively minor compared to a more significant hurricane. Numerous trees were blown down very early on Monday morning from Fajardo to San Juan Metro. Downed trees were reported to block highways in Gurabo, Adjuntas, Caguas while a down power pole lay on Highway PR-176 in Cupey.||On August 27 Puerto Rico had been declared a major disaster area, and by September 3 additional municipalities were added to provide aid to those impacted, and still more on September 13. In all, there were 29 municipalities approved for individual assistance to individuals and households while 37 municipalities were designated for public assistance to state and local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations for emergency work and the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 62 year old woman in her vehicle was overtaken by flood waters as she attempted to drive across a flooded roadway PR-857 in Barrio Canovanillas, Cohitre sector.

Event precipitation totals averaged 4 to 9 inches, except in Berks County where 6 to 12 inches fell.  One drowning occurred in Philadelphia. The heavy rain caused widespread poor drainage flooding as well as moderate flooding along the Delaware and Schuylkill Basins and minor to moderate flooding along the Lehigh River Basin. Crests in the upper Schuylkill, Lehigh and Delaware River Basins were higher than what occurred with Irene the previous month and the highest crests since late June of 2006 in most instances. The crests along the Delaware River were 2 to 4 feet higher than what occurred during Irene. Some of the smaller streams in southeastern Pennsylvania reached major flooding levels, but most of those crests were lower than what occurred with Irene. In addition to the freshwater flooding, moderate tidal flooding occurred along the lower Delaware River and its tributaries. ||In the most recent available flooding assessment for Eastern Pennsylvania, there were 22 homes and businesses that were destroyed, 201 that suffered major damage, 672 that had minor damage and 1217 others that were affected. The preliminary damage estimate for the state of Pennsylvania was five hundred million dollars.  Please look for possible updates in future monthly issues of stormdata.| |The combination of fresh water runoff and a weak southerly flow produced moderate tidal flooding during the evening high tide cycles from the 7th through the 9th and minor tidal flooding with all of the other high tide cycles from the evening of the 6th through overnight on the 11th. The highest tides occurred during the evening high tide cycle on the 8th in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties and the evening high tide cycle on the 9th in Bucks County.  The evening high tide on the 8th in Philadelphia reached 9.41 feet above mean lower low water. Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. The high tide in Newbold Island (Bucks County) reached 12.11 feet above mean lower low water. There is no current categorical tide gage information for this site.  ||Tropical Storm Lee made landfall in Louisiana during the morning of the 4th and moved slowly northeast. An approaching cold front from the Mississippi Valley reached Lee by the morning of the 5th and transformed it to an extratropical system on the 5th in Mississippi. The same cold front acted as a conduit for Lee's moisture farther to the northeast. Showers and thunderstorms from that approaching cold front arrived during the evening and overnight on the 5th  and set off the first round of flash flooding rains in Northeast Pennsylvania. The front then stalled just south of Delmarva on the 6th. A relative lull in the rain then occurred during the morning of the 6th. As the front started to back north as a warm front later in the day on the 6th, more bands of heavier rain returned that afternoon and particularly that evening. A blocking weather pattern then moved the frontal boundary little from the morning of the 7th into the morning of the 8th across southeast Pennsylvania. A couple of bands of flash flood producing rains started to form and move east into Eastern Pennsylvania during the late afternoon and evening of the 7th and continued through the night.  The frontal boundary started to drift offshore later in the day on the 8th and most of the precipitation associated with Lee was done.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A band of showers and thunderstorms with heavy rain caused flash flooding of smaller streams as well as poor drainage flooding in Philadelphia. It also caused the drowning death of a 27-year-old woman who was caught in flood waters in the East Germantown section of the city.  She was discovered in the rear of her Sports Utility Vehicle at the intersection of Musgrave and Haines Streets on the morning of the 8th.  The Wingohocking Creek, which is a creek that was buried underground during the 19th century had its waters back out of sewer grates and manhole covers in that section of the city.  Godfrey Avenue and Wister Street also flooded in East Germantown. The wall of a church also collapsed. Most gaged creeks within Philadelphia flooded as well as the Schuylkill River.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

For the first time in approximately three weeks, isolated thunderstorms developed over the Sierra crest around Kings Canyon and points just to the north and east. The surge of monsoonal moisture continued through the end of the month, with the strongest thunderstorm activity on July 30th and the morning of the 31st. A few thunderstorms over the Southern Sierra Nevada had rain rates of an inch or more in an hour, and a severe thunderstorm moved over Edwards Air Force Base during the afternoon of the 30th. The warm nature of the monsoonal moisture kept central and southern San Joaquin Valley high temperatures around 100 degrees through July 30th. ||A line of thunderstorms moved through the central and southern San Joaquin Valley during the morning of July 31st, bringing record-tying rain to both Bakersfield and Fresno. After the thunderstorms moved out of the San Joaquin Valley, skies began to clear and temperatures warmed rapidly. With the cloud cover, the temperature at Fresno was between 70-72 degrees for most of the morning of the 31st. But once the clouds began to clear, the temperature warmed at a rate of 8 degrees per hour from 11 AM to 1 PM (reaching 88 degrees), and topped out at 97 degrees at 5 PM.|Both Bakersfield and Fresno were 0.6 degrees warmer than normal for July. However, July was the last month to use the 1971-2000 30-year climatological normals. The new normals, for 1981-2010, were implemented of August 1st. The new average temperature for July is slightly warmer than the 1971-2000 average.

However, an upper level low moved from the Great Basin into central California on the 9th. This atypical movement of the low occurred because it was cut off from the prevailing westerly winds aloft. These systems usually move into the area from the Pacific Ocean. This low changed the flow aloft over the region to southeasterly, drawing moisture into central California from Arizona and northwestern Mexico. This warm, unstable airmass brought showers and thunderstorms to much of interior central California from the 9th through the 14th. Isolated thunderstorms continued over the Sierra Nevada crest on the 15th, as residual moisture remained over the area while the southeasterly flow transitioned to a more southwesterly direction. ||The low meandered across central and southern California during these several days. This low allowed for unstable conditions over the entire district; quite a few locations in the San Joaquin Valley received at least a trace of rain. On the 9th, thunderstorms produced little rainfall, but they did cause quite a few wildfires due to lightning over the mountains in Kern County (around Keene, Breckenridge, and just to the east of Arvin and Bakersfield). As for the 10th, numerous thunderstorms developed over Kern County and much of the southern San Joaquin Valley during the evening. In addition, more wildfires developed over the Kern County mountains A severe thunderstorm warning and numerous significant weather advisories were issued throughout Kern County that evening; these storms moved westward into San Luis Obispo County later that night. Afternoon showers and thunderstorms redeveloped mainly over the Tehachapi Mountains and the Southern Sierra Nevada daily on the 11th, 12th, and 13th, and a few showers occurred over the south end of the San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield, on the 13th.

However, an upper level low moved from the Great Basin into central California on the 9th. This atypical movement of the low occurred because it was cut off from the prevailing westerly winds aloft. These systems usually move into the area from the Pacific Ocean. This low changed the flow aloft over the region to southeasterly, drawing moisture into central California from Arizona and northwestern Mexico. This warm, unstable airmass brought showers and thunderstorms to much of interior central California from the 9th through the 14th. Isolated thunderstorms continued over the Sierra Nevada crest on the 15th, as residual moisture remained over the area while the southeasterly flow transitioned to a more southwesterly direction. ||The low meandered across central and southern California during these several days. This low allowed for unstable conditions over the entire district; quite a few locations in the San Joaquin Valley received at least a trace of rain. On the 9th, thunderstorms produced little rainfall, but they did cause quite a few wildfires due to lightning over the mountains in Kern County (around Keene, Breckenridge, and just to the east of Arvin and Bakersfield). As for the 10th, numerous thunderstorms developed over Kern County and much of the southern San Joaquin Valley during the evening. In addition, more wildfires developed over the Kern County mountains A severe thunderstorm warning and numerous significant weather advisories were issued throughout Kern County that evening; these storms moved westward into San Luis Obispo County later that night. Afternoon showers and thunderstorms redeveloped mainly over the Tehachapi Mountains and the Southern Sierra Nevada daily on the 11th, 12th, and 13th, and a few showers occurred over the south end of the San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield, on the 13th. Thunderstorms that developed over the Piutes during the afternoon of September 11th were nearly stationary, and runoff from these storms caused road flooding in the area south of Lake Isabella. ||The South Lightning Tennessee Fire occurred in Tulare county 5 miles north of Fountain Springs.

At Denver International Airport alone, large hail up to golfball size, very heavy rain and wind gusts to 59 mph caused substantial damage to 40 planes and stranded approximately 1,500 passengers overnight.  Frontier and United Airlines were hardest hit as dozens of planes were taken out of service for repairs; forcing the cancellation of at least 220 flights over the next several days.  Damage to the aircrafts alone was nearly $5 million.   In addition, 83 cars in airport parking lots were damaged, along with some police cars and maintenance vehicles.  In Watkins, two people suffered minor injuries and 35 to 40 homes were damaged.  As many as 200 residents in a mobile home park were left homeless by the storm, forcing the Red Cross to open a shelter at Bennett High School.  The trailer park contained 52 mobile homes, 14 recreational vehicles, 3 houses and a commercial building.  Hailstones the size of softballs cratered the north sides of the mobile homes.  Some farmers in the area said they lost as much as 85 percent of their total wheat crop.  Power lines were also damaged which affected about 1,200 customers in Watkins.  The strong winds also flipped over a tractor-trailer rig on Interstate 70 near Watkins Road.  Insurance claims for the Watkins, Bennett and Brighton areas was estimated to be $17 million.  The total damage estimate across the entire Urban Corridor, was $164.8 million, and included 17,200 automobile claims and 12,600 homeowner claims.||In addition, thunderstorms producing very heavy rainfall, caused flash flooding in the Four Mile Canyon burn scar west of Boulder.  Three homes reportedly had water up to the windows with water flowing into structures at Fourmile Canyon Road and Gold Run Road.  The heavy rain caused a 4-ft surge along Fourmile Creek through Orodell and into the entry of Boulder Creek.  Several roads were affected which restricted access to the area.  Roads were closed due to water and debris.  Private bridges and drives were washed out and several residents were stranded and later rescued.

The largest hail fell across the Florence area, where hailstones reached 3 inches in diameter, toward Eppley Airfield where some softball size stones fell.  The hail was accompanied by thunderstorm wind gusts that were measured at 62 mph by Asos at Eppley.  The wind driven hail caused substantial damage to vehicles and houses in eastern and northern Omaha and many cars that were parked in outdoor long-term parking at Eppley had their windows broken out by the first storm then soaked by heavy rain from the second.  Also at Eppley several commercial planes sustained hail damage and a pilot was seriously injured around his eye when a softball-size stone crashed through the passenger gate/ramp leading to a plane at the gate.  Around 270 of 600 decorative globe light along a drive toward the airport were shattered by the hail and wind, resulting in damage of around $500,000.  Hail size was smaller and possibly even absent across the western and southwestern parts of town.   According to State Farm, the largest auto insurer in Nebraska, 1,600 claims were made within a few days of the storm with more likely to follow, with most claims from the Omaha area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
