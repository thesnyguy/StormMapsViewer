The focus of the severe weather was across central and southern Mississippi.  This event was driven by a potent disturbance that swung across the area during the midday and afternoon hours. As this strong feature dropped into the Lower Mississippi River Valley, a surface low rapidly deepened as it tracked across central Mississippi. The atmospheric response to this was for a rapid increase in winds aloft and higher low level moisture. This combination set the stage for an unstable environment that contained high levels of wind shear which supported and sustained tornado development.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An intense microburst occurred along the Lincoln/Copiah County line. Damage occurred just west of Jackson-Liberty Road and north of Norton-Assink Road. Here a mobile home rolled multiple times and was destroyed. A couple of minor injuries occurred at this location. Other damage that was noted was many uprooted trees along nearly a 3 mile swath. All of the uprooted trees were blown down to the east-northeast. Along Old Red Star Road, the roof of a metal shed was blown off and tin was blown into a tree along with some tin peeled off the corner of a roof of another home. The width of this damage was nearly 1 mile wide with max winds around 95 mph.

There was a mixture of hardwood and softwood trees, however softwood trees made up most of the trees in this area of the park. There were approximately 10 vehicles that suffered significant damage. There were 10 to 15 campers that suffered significant damage with one overturned. The overturned camper was a pop-up camper. The wind being channeled into a couple of the coves may have produced some of the strongest winds with the event. The diameter of the trees damaged ranged from around 6 inches up to 2 feet. The damage stretched from the park ranger residence northward to the end of the point where the campground is located. This distance is approximately one half mile. There was one injury associated with this event. A 5 year old female child inside one of the campers that was struck by a fallen tree suffered a broken arm. About $25,000 in damage was done to the cabins at the park. Damage estimates for the vehicles and campers is unknown.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This allowed a very warm and excessively humid air mass to be in place over the area.  As temperatures rose through the 80s and into the 90s, dewpoints were unusually high in the mid to upper 70s.  By the afternoon hours, this produced heat index values over 100 degrees in many valley areas, with some spots in the mid-Hudson Valley seeing heat index values approach 110 degrees.||At the same time, a surface cold front was approaching the area from the west.  Some clusters of thunderstorms developed in the early to mid afternoon hours across the Lake George-Saratoga Region, producing damage to trees and power lines.  In addition, one storm in the Lake George area contained a lightning strike, which injured multiple people huddled under a tree.||By the evening hours, a more organized line of thunderstorms moved from west to east across all of eastern Upstate New York.  This line produced widespread wind damage, with the most concentrated damage in the Pine Lake area of northwestern Fulton County. ||In addition to the gusty winds, the thunderstorms also produced a significant amount of cloud-to-ground lightning. Over 50,000 customers lost power at the height of the storms as a result of the gusty winds and lightning strikes.||Thunderstorms ended with the passage of the cold front during the overnight hours.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> At least 59 structures and 18 vehicles were damaged or destroyed at Pine Lake Campground due to downed trees from thunderstorm winds.

The large swath of 8 to 15 inches of rain across Eastern and Central North Carolina, caused devastating and life threatening flash flooding, that evolved into major and record setting river flooding along portions of the Neuse, Cape Fear, and Tar river basins. ||Matthew���s inland flood waters resulted in 11 direct fatalities within the WFO RAH CWA, approximately $686 million in property damage to flooded homes and businesses, and $150 million in crop damage. Countless roads and highways were underwater, along with with numerous roads washed out, including sections of Interstates 95 and 40. Besides the 11 direct fatalities, at least 3 indirect fatalities also occurred. ||In addition, the associated strong wind gusts of 50 to 70 mph resulted in 1 fatality, when a tree fell onto a moving vehicle.

Flooding damaged approximately 4,050 structures throughout the county, resulting in $62.1 million in property damage and and at least $20 million in crop damage. There was more than 700 swift water rescues in Cumberland County alone. The flooding resulted in 2 direct fatalities. A 81 year old female was found dead inside her vehicle in the 100 block of Rhodes Pond Road. After flood waters receded, a 53 year old male was found less than 100 yards away from his vehicle near the Clinton Road exit on the southbound side of I-95.  There were also 2 indirect fatality.  A 63-year-old man died several days later from a pre-existing health condition after he was unable to refill his prescription medication due to flooded and impassable roadways. The second indirect fatality occurred several weeks later when a construction equipment operator died while repairing an earthen dam damaged by Hurricane Matthew.

A cold front stretched from Nebraska to Texas on the morning of March 8th. The front moved southeastward and stalled across Southeast Missouri as an upper level low remained stationary over Texas. A very moist atmosphere was in place over the Mid-South south of this boundary. Several weak low pressure centers developed and moved along the stalled front. As a result, periods of heavy rain, up to an inch per hour in some cases, fell over the same locations. Over the several day stretch, the front fluctuated at times shifting the heaviest band of rain. The storm total rainfall over the 5 day period ranged from four to ten inches over Northwest Mississippi. The heavy rain caused widespread flash flooding and many roads were closed as a result. In addition, numerous streams and small rivers overflowed their banks.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Multiple rounds of heavy rain caused flooding in Quitman County.

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ���It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn���t go back.���||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged. In the worst cases, sections of road bed were washed away.  Public bridges and small private bridges were damaged or destroyed. Large debris piles collected against bridges. Countless vehicles were flooded.  Electricity and water were lost for days in the hardest hit flood areas.         ||The American Red Cross had over 800 workers helping at its peak.  They distributed over 7,500 cleanup kits and over 100,000 meals and snacks.  Many church based organizations and ordinary individual citizens volunteered their time and services to help in the flood recovery.  Nationally known celebrities and sport figures, with ties to West Virginia, also helped to raise awareness and increase donations for flood recovery.||The state transportation secretary estimated 8 million dollars in damage to roads in Clay County, 8 million dollars in Nicholas, over 13 million in Kanawha County.||Several schools were severely damaged by flood waters. This included in Clay County, White Elementary and the county bus garage. In Kanawha County, Herbert Hoover High School, Clendenin Elementary, Elk Valley Christian School, plus Bridge Elementary Schools were severely damaged.  Water from the Elk River crested about 7 feet deep in the first flood at Herbert Hoover High School. In Nicholas County. Richwood High and Middle School was severely damaged.  Moderate flood damage occurred to Clay High School and Elkview Middle School.  Minor flood damage occurred at Middle Birch Elementary School in Braxton County.  Minor flood damage also was seen in Ansted Elementary in Fayette County and Glade Elementary in Webster County.||A state of emergency was declared by Governor Tomblin.  At its peak deployment, around 650 members of the West Virginia Army National Guard and West Virginia Air National Guard were activated.  Major tasks assigned to the guard troops included delivering supplies to residents with no road access, and removal of flood debris.  Private contractors were also used for debris removal. In just Kanawha County, 15,000 tons of flood debris were collected.       ||A federal disaster was quickly declared by President Obama.  At least 8 counties were eligible from the events of June 23rd and 24th within the forecast area of the National Weather Service in Charleston. They included Jackson, Roane, Kanawha, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties.  See FEMA disaster number 4273-DR for more information.  Over 4900 individuals applied for federal assistance from those 8 counties, totaling over 20 million dollars.  Public assistance for debris removal, emergency protective services, roads, bridges, and schools, was over 50 million dollar in those same 8 counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The flood of record occurred on the lower Elk River around Clendenin.  ||Two women died. They were trying to save family heirlooms in the basement of a home in Elkview.  In likely their last cell phone contact, 1 of the 2 women described the scene, as like the Titanic. An elderly man also died in his home in Elkview.  Another young woman died, but the situation was unknown. | |Both the flash flooding and the river flooding were severe, but the amount of damage from the record river flooding was likely higher in Kanawha County, than the damage from the flash flooding.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 36.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ���It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn���t go back.���||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged. In the worst cases, sections of road bed were washed away.  Public bridges and small private bridges were damaged or destroyed. Large debris piles collected against bridges. Countless vehicles were flooded.  Electricity and water were lost for days in the hardest hit flood areas.         ||The American Red Cross had over 800 workers helping at its peak.  They distributed over 7,500 cleanup kits and over 100,000 meals and snacks.  Many church based organizations and ordinary individual citizens volunteered their time and services to help in the flood recovery.  Nationally known celebrities and sport figures, with ties to West Virginia, also helped to raise awareness and increase donations for flood recovery.||The state transportation secretary estimated 8 million dollars in damage to roads in Clay County, 8 million dollars in Nicholas, over 13 million in Kanawha County.||Several schools were severely damaged by flood waters. This included in Clay County, White Elementary and the county bus garage. In Kanawha County, Herbert Hoover High School, Clendenin Elementary, Elk Valley Christian School, plus Bridge Elementary Schools were severely damaged.  Water from the Elk River crested about 7 feet deep in the first flood at Herbert Hoover High School. In Nicholas County. Richwood High and Middle School was severely damaged.  Moderate flood damage occurred to Clay High School and Elkview Middle School.  Minor flood damage occurred at Middle Birch Elementary School in Braxton County.  Minor flood damage also was seen in Ansted Elementary in Fayette County and Glade Elementary in Webster County.||A state of emergency was declared by Governor Tomblin.  At its peak deployment, around 650 members of the West Virginia Army National Guard and West Virginia Air National Guard were activated.  Major tasks assigned to the guard troops included delivering supplies to residents with no road access, and removal of flood debris.  Private contractors were also used for debris removal. In just Kanawha County, 15,000 tons of flood debris were collected.       ||A federal disaster was quickly declared by President Obama.  At least 8 counties were eligible from the events of June 23rd and 24th within the forecast area of the National Weather Service in Charleston. They included Jackson, Roane, Kanawha, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties.  See FEMA disaster number 4273-DR for more information.  Over 4900 individuals applied for federal assistance from those 8 counties, totaling over 20 million dollars.  Public assistance for debris removal, emergency protective services, roads, bridges, and schools, was over 50 million dollar in those same 8 counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Severe flash flooding occurred in the northeastern portion of the county.  Streams such as Jordan Creek, Doctors Creek, Thorofare Run, Little Sandy Creek, Wills Creek, and the lower reaches of Big Sandy Creek caused much destruction. ||Little Sandy Creek inundated one large culvert over the only road access to a shopping plaza. The road collapsed.  Many shoppers were stranded.  About 200 people slept in their vehicles overnight, before walking out on the 24th.   ||A 62 year old male drowned along Jordan Creek.  He did not leave his home. His small house was washed away. A 47 year old female drowned in her vehicle. She was on a flooded road along Wills Creek.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 26.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In all, approximately 25,000 homes and hundreds of additional businesses suffered various degrees of flooding, though it's difficult to determine how many were due to initial flash flooding and how many were due to subsequent river flooding. Due to the extremely high water levels on the Amite river, water flowed back upstream on many streams and bayous, leading to a significant back water flooding problem. Much of the flooding in the southern part of the parish was due to this back water flooding. The end time of the flood is based on when Bayou Manchac near Little Prairie dropped below flood stage. However, some back water flooding continued on the Bluff Swamp for several more days. Four fatalities are attributed to the flooding. A 58 year old man drowned near the Mallard Lakes subdivision off Hoo Shoo Too Rd, likely some time the morning of Sunday 8/14. He was last seen late Saturday night riding a 4-wheeler. A 63 year old woman drowned the afternoon of Sunday 8/14 when her vehicle was swept away while trying to turn around in flood waters near the intersection of North Ridge Dr. and Hwy 423.

A sub-tropical low pressure system that produced torrential rains along the Gulf of Mexico coast then turned north, eventually getting pulled northeast across Missouri along the stalled cold front. This low brought copious amounts of moisture. Showers and isolated thunderstorms brought torrential downpours between the 13th and 17th. Rainfall amounts during this time ranged from 5 to 10 inches north and west of Cape Girardeau, including the Poplar Bluff and Perryville areas.

Flooding of farmland was rather extensive south and southeast of Poplar Bluff. Floodwater from the river eventually shut down Highway 53 near the Black River bridge between Qulin and Poplar Bluff. The flooding was exacerbated by a levee breach at County Road 202 near Qulin.

A fence was laid down as well. A few homes here had minor roof damage where shingles were blown off. The tornado then tracked across US Highway 165 where it moved through open field. It tracked into the South Delta Regional Correctional Facility. Quite a bit of damage was done to the facility as it took a direct hit. Several large sections of the outer fence were torn down. Five buildings on the south side of the complex sustained roof damage where shingles and sheet paper were removed. The gym building, a metal structure, was heavily damaged where a large section of wall was removed. The main building of the complex suffered roof damage where roughly half of the roof was lifted or had parts removed. The roof is not a typical roof; it has several layers. Large portions of the foam insulation were pulled out along with several sections of a thin roof covering. A couple of the guard watch towers had the windows blown out and some minor damage. One employee was injured trying to exit a tower and broke a leg. The tornado then moved into a wooded area, where trees were snapped and a metal carport was thrown and destroyed. As the tornado crossed Highway 35, many more trees were damaged. One home sustained minor roof damage on the south side of the highway. The tornado crossed US Highway 65 and snapped more trees. It then continued through a large wooded area and farmland and it moved into Desha County. It then crossed Highway 159 where many more trees were snapped and uprooted. Where it crossed Highway 159, a home sustained some minor roof damage and had the wood framed shed destroyed. A few power lines were down here as well. The tornado continued northeast into a wooded area where more trees were damaged. Though the tornado likely dissipated a bit farther east, no access was available to that area due to flooding. The total path length was 9.2 miles, with 2.6 miles of that in Desha County. The maximum estimated winds were 105 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado then weakened as it moved to the east side of the Turnpike, where large limbs were broken off trees, power lines knocked down, and smaller trees uprooted along Blount Road. Minor roof damage occurred to the North Homeless Assistance Center in this area.

From there, it continued on a northeastward path across a large part of Pickens County. The tornado was caught live on Camera by local media just after it crossed the intersection of Hwy 32 and County Road 1, just west of Cochrane. It continued northeast to the Cochrane Campground on the Tombigbee River, where scores of trees were snapped, causing minor damage to one of the buildings on the campground. The tornado first reached EF-2 magnitude as it crossed private wooded land just south of County Road 78 snapping and uprooting hundreds of trees. As the tornado crossed Huff-Barnett Road, it mowed down a wide swath of trees, with a distinct classic convergence pattern of tree fall just east of Beaver Creek. The tornado continued northeastward across Al Hwy 14 causing damage to the federal prison, and then moved on to the Martin Luther King Road/Sapp community northwest of Aliceville. Here, the tornado reached its highest rated damage. Many of the homes in this portion of the Sapp community received some extent of damage, and several were destroyed. From there, the weakening tornado continued northeastward roughly parallel to AL Hwy 17 over open and forested rural Pickens County until it passed just west of Carrollton. The tornado reintensified and broadened somewhat, with a more significant tree-fall causing damage to a few homes on the west side of Carrollton. The tornado continued on the same northeastward path gradually weakening over rural areas before lifting near Herbert Windle Road southwest of Reform.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the tornado crossed Huff-Barnett Road, it mowed down a wide swath of trees, with a distinct classic convergence pattern of tree fall just east of Beaver Creek. The tornado continued northeastward across Al Hwy 14 causing damage to the federal prison, and then moved on to the Martin Luther King Road/Sapp community northwest of Aliceville. Here, the tornado reached its highest rated damage. Many of the homes in this portion of the Sapp community received some extent of damage, and several were destroyed. From there, the weakening tornado continued northeastward roughly parallel to AL Hwy 17 over open and forested rural Pickens County until it passed just west of Carrollton. The tornado reintensified and broadened somewhat, with a more significant tree-fall causing damage to a few homes on the west side of Carrollton. The tornado continued on the same northeastward path gradually weakening over rural areas before lifting near Herbert Windle Road southwest of Reform.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado then continued on a continuous path for nearly 16 miles across much of northwestern Calhoun County. Initial damage northwest of Edison, GA in northwestern Calhoun County was largely limited to downed or snapped trees. As the tornado neared Georgia Highway 216, there was an area of more concentrated damage along Magnolia Road. Two single wide mobile homes were destroyed at this location along with numerous snapped pine trees. Damage in this area was consistent with EF-1 damage or a maximum wind of around 100-105 mph. For the following four miles of the track, damage was once again limited to mostly downed or snapped trees. More significant damage occurred east of the Ichawaynochaway Creek north of Georgia Highway 37 near Dickey, GA. On Country Club Road, a single family residence was damaged, with a portion of the exterior brick wall collapsed, large sections of the roof removed, and debris blown 100-200 yards from the structure. Large trees near the residence were uprooted or snapped. Across the road, a double wide mobile home had some sections of walls and roof removed, and it was blown off its foundation by a couple feet. Additional large, healthy trees were snapped and uprooted at that location. Damage in this area was consistent with high end EF-1 to low end EF-2 damage, with a maximum wind of 110-120 mph. Even more significant damage occurred further east along the Dickey Bypass. Numerous trees in this area were snapped and uprooted. Along the south side of the road, a double-wide mobile home was completely obliterated with debris blown across the road about 50 yards or more into a tree line. This mobile home was strapped and anchored to the ground in several locations, with the anchors sticking into the ground approximately a foot. The mobile home frame separated completely and wrapped around a nearby tree. Numerous hardwood trees near the home were snapped. Damage at this location was the most intense along the track of this tornado and was consistent with strong EF-2 damage, with a maximum wind of 125 to 130 mph. Analysis of the damage patterns suggests that this mobile home may have been hit by a subvortex in the tornado, as debris was blown across the path of the tornado to the north. Most of the debris along the rest of the path tended to be blown in a more easterly direction. Just to the east of that residence, another house was damaged, with a small portion of the roof removed. The residents stated that the roof had separated from the walls, but set down again in a slightly different location. Almost all the pine trees near this house were snapped. The tree damage continued to the east for about another mile, with a medium sized shed or outbuilding also destroyed near the end of the tornado path.

On March 30th an upper level storm system moved into the region from the Southern Plains. It was accompanied by a slow moving cold front extending from a large surface low across the Central Plains into the middle Mississippi Valley.||A warm moisture rich air mass from the Gulf of Mexico moved into the region as a warm front lifted northward on the 30th. A series of potent upper level disturbances crossed the region through the 31st, bringing a rapid increase in wind aloft and resulting in an unstable environment that contained high levels of wind shear. These factors set the stage for flash flooding and several rounds of severe weather. Widespread severe weather occurred with a mix of damaging winds, up to golf ball sized hail, and tornadoes. Two EF-1 Tornadoes occurred in Chicot County, one of which resulted in an injury.

An outbuilding was damaged at this location as well and a pontoon boat was blown several yards. The tornado continued through the center of Dermott intermittently snapping and uprooting trees and breaking a couple utility poles along the path. Minor roof damage occurred at a senior care facility, an abandoned trailer was damaged, and a fence was blown down. On the east side of down, a light pole was blown over at a baseball field and a small billboard was blown over. As the tornado crossed the intersection of AR Highway 35 and US Highway 165, several construction cones were blown away. The tornado reached its strongest point in a field north of Highway 35, where a farm equipment shed was demolished. Heavy foundation blocks and farm trailers were moved. Debris was scattered at least a half mile to the north through fields and across US Highway 165. The tornado lifted shortly thereafter.

The initial round of thunderstorms occurred early in the afternoon over northwest Kentucky. These storms, which produced a major hailstorm and flash flood in the Owensboro area, were triggered by a weak upper-level low over northern Illinois. This initial round of thunderstorms produced an outflow of cooler air that settled south into southwest Kentucky. By mid-afternoon, isolated supercells with tornadoes fired up along the leading edge of cooler air. Strong westerly upper-level winds associated with the upper-level low over Illinois provided ample wind shear for supercells. A southwest wind flow of moist and unstable air in the lower levels of the atmosphere provided fuel for the storms. Low-level winds up to around 40 knots enhanced low-level wind shear, providing a favorable environment for tornadoes. The supercells lingered well into the evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Dozens of structures were destroyed, including mobile homes, businesses, barns, and garages. Several homes received major damage or were destroyed. Many dozens of other homes and businesses received minor damage, mainly loss of shingles and fascia. Several dozen cars were damaged or destroyed. Some cars were tossed around and lofted atop other cars or structures. Thousands of trees were snapped, uprooted, or broken. The tornado was captured on video or camera by numerous individuals. The tornado appeared to have more than one vortex at several different points along its path. The tornado moved through some residential and commercial neighborhoods just outside the northern city limits of Mayfield. A car dealership on U.S. Highway 45 right near the city limit received extensive damage, including the loss of almost all 40 vehicles on the lot as well as a nearby storage building. The peak wind speed of 140 mph was assigned at this car lot. A flea market type of business on Highway 121 just outside Mayfield was destroyed by winds near 135 mph. Once the tornado reached the northern edge of Mayfield, it tracked almost parallel to the Purchase Parkway (future Interstate 69). The center of the tornado stayed about one-half mile north of the parkway, crossing Kentucky Highways 131 and 301 prior to reaching the Marshall County line. The average path width was approximately 300 yards. Peak wind speeds were estimated near 140 mph. The tornado continued into Marshall County very close to where the parkway crosses the county line.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The peak wind speed of 140 mph was assigned at this car lot. A flea market type of business on Highway 121 just outside Mayfield was destroyed by winds near 135 mph. Once the tornado reached the northern edge of Mayfield, it tracked almost parallel to the Purchase Parkway (future Interstate 69). The center of the tornado stayed about one-half mile north of the parkway, crossing Kentucky Highways 131 and 301 prior to reaching the Marshall County line. The average path width was approximately 300 yards. Peak wind speeds were estimated near 140 mph. The tornado continued into Marshall County very close to where the parkway crosses the county line.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado crossed over Interstate 10 just west of 9th Avenue. EF-1 damage was noted primarily to hardwood trees in the area of Interstate 10 and 9th Avenue. Intensification was noted as it moved further east of 9th Avenue and east of Northpointe Boulevard. The roof was blown off of two homes, one on La Borde Lane and one on Gladstone Drive. Additional EF-2 damage to homes was observed further to the northeast on Tradewinds Drive. Two vehicles were overturned in this location. It was at this point that further intensification began. The tornado reached peak intensity as it moved over the Mooring Apartments on Old Spanish Trail and the General Electric plant. EF-3 damage was observed at two of the apartment buildings with major damage to the second story. EF-3 damage occurred at the GE plant where a warehouse was destroyed. Additional EF-3 damage was noted at the Grand Baroque townhomes on Scenic Highway where two unities were destroyed. The tornado then moved into Escambia Bay and produced additional damage once it moved into Santa Rosa County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 22.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first area of EF-2 damage was noted on Lansing Drive where significant roof damage was observed to a couple of homes along with snapped power poles and extensive tree damage. The tornado crossed over Interstate 10 just west of 9th Avenue. EF-1 damage was noted primarily to hardwood trees in the area of Interstate 10 and 9th Avenue. Intensification was noted as it moved further east of 9th Avenue and east of Northpointe Boulevard. The roof was blown off of two homes, one on La Borde Lane and one on Gladstone Drive. Additional EF-2 damage to homes was observed further to the northeast on Tradewinds Drive. Two vehicles were overturned in this location. It was at this point that further intensification began. The tornado reached peak intensity as it moved over the Mooring Apartments on Old Spanish Trail and the General Electric plant. EF-3 damage was observed at two of the apartment buildings with major damage to the second story. EF-3 damage occurred at the GE plant where a warehouse was destroyed. Additional EF-3 damage was noted at the Grand Baroque townhomes on Scenic Highway where two unities were destroyed. The tornado then moved into Escambia Bay and produced additional damage once it moved into Santa Rosa County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 22.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A cluster of thunderstorms that developed near the coast intersected a lingering surface trough and tapped deeper moisture.

The tornado initially touched down in the community of Landfall near Arboretum Drive and Fair Lakes Drive. Extensive damage was done to about 30 stately trees along Fair Lakes Drive, Marshland Drive, Inverary Way and Dundee Lakes Place. A few trees up to two feet in diameter were snapped off and numerous trees were uprooted. Several large limbs were blown out of trees and caused damage to one home on Dundee Lakes Place where windows were also blown out. A vehicle weighing more than 4000 pounds with two passengers inside was traveling on Fair Lakes Drive. The tornado lifted the car from the street and deposited it at an angle on the grass a few feet away. The vehicle did sustain damage, but the occupants were not injured. The tornado crossed Howe Creek and produced significant damage to approximately two dozen large trees in the Timber Creek neighborhood. Falling limbs resulted in one injury on Tree Lake Court. The tops of several trees were snapped off and many were uprooted. Minor shingle and fascia damage was noted to one home as well. The tornado then crossed Middle Sound Loop Road and caused extensive damage to numerous trees and several homes on Wellington Drive and East Bedford Road.

The tornado initially touched down in the community of Landfall near Arboretum Drive and Fair Lakes Drive. Extensive damage was done to about 30 stately trees along Fair Lakes Drive, Marshland Drive, Inverary Way and Dundee Lakes Place. A few trees up to two feet in diameter were snapped off and numerous trees were uprooted. Several large limbs were blown out of trees and caused damage to one home on Dundee Lakes Place where windows were also blown out. A vehicle weighing more than 4000 pounds with two passengers inside was traveling on Fair Lakes Drive. The tornado lifted the car from the street and deposited it at an angle on the grass a few feet away. The vehicle did sustain damage, but the occupants were not injured. The tornado crossed Howe Creek and produced significant damage to approximately two dozen large trees in the Timber Creek neighborhood. Falling limbs resulted in one injury on Tree Lake Court. The tops of several trees were snapped off and many were uprooted. Minor shingle and fascia damage was noted to one home as well. The tornado then crossed Middle Sound Loop Road and caused extensive damage to numerous trees and several homes on Wellington Drive and East Bedford Road. Dozens of trees up to two feet in diameter were uprooted or snapped. A large snapped pine tree fell through the roof of a home on East Bedford Road. The funnel lifted for the last time near the intersection of Middle Sound Loop Road and Buckeye Drive.

Very heavy rainfall and isolated hail occurred with the main area of storms. But these storms also produced a wide area of one half to two inches of rain by sunrise. ||The morning two events set the stage for flooding in central Minnesota as several additional waves of thunderstorms developed during the afternoon, and into the evening. By Tuesday morning, a wide area of three to six inches of rain fell from north of St. Cloud to Milaca and Mora. The highest totals were across northern Kanabec County where locally six to eight inches fell based on radar estimation. The Rum, Snake and Knife rivers spilled out of their banks and caused significant and widespread flooding. ||A secondary point related to this flooding event was that according to the Minnesota State Climatology Office, this storm, which continued into the morning hours of July 12th, was the largest mega-rain event since the Duluth flood of June 19-20, 2012. A mega-rain event is classified as a six-inch rainfall that covers at least a 1000 square miles, with a central core value of at least 8 inches. ||The secondary wave in the morning, weakened by the early afternoon.

It had a maximum width of 100 yards and traveled approximately 3.1 miles. The tornado caused a lot of tree damage, though three single family homes received significant roof damage, and a double wide manufactured home, and garage were flipped and rolled. Another garage and shed were destroyed near Highway 12 on the north side of town.||The tornado near Watkins was also rated an EF-2 with peak winds of 125 mph. It had a maximum width of 400 yards and traveled approximately 2.1 miles. One injury occurred with this tornado. The first significant damage was to a business along Highway 55 on the south side of town. The tornado then tracked across the highway and passed through the St. Anthony Cemetery before passing through the center of Watkins doing damage to structures and many trees. The most significant damage occurred between Stearns Ave and Meeker Ave where several homes had significant roof damage, and had detached sheds, and garages destroyed. The tornado exited the town and did further tree damage at a farmstead outside of town before lifting shortly thereafter.||The tornado north of Watkins was rated an EF-1 with peak winds of 105 mph. It had a maximum width of 250 yards and traveled approximately 4.2 miles. This tornado was spawned by the same storm that moved through Watkins. Multiple chaser videos showed the Watkins tornado lifted off the ground as it became occluded, with this tornadoes touchdown point made visible by the presence of corn laid down in the field south of the first homestead hit.

The storms moved across eastern Oklahoma during the evening hours. Prior to the storms moving into the area, the atmosphere ahead of the dry line in eastern Oklahoma had become very unstable. This instability, combined with very strong wind shear associated with a strong trough of low pressure that moved into the Southern Plains from the Southern Rockies, resulted in the development of supercell thunderstorms. One of these supercells produced multiple tornadoes as it tracked along and near an outflow boundary from morning thunderstorms, which had settled across southeastern Oklahoma by the afternoon.

The tornado made a turn to the east at the N4000 Road and maintained an eastward movement until dissipating before reaching the N4090 Road. The tornado destroyed at least three mobile homes. Two injuries occurred in one of the mobile homes, one of which was a critical injury. Numerous homes were damaged by this tornado, with the worst damage including major loss of the roof structure and collapse of a few exterior walls. Numerous outbuildings were also destroyed. A metal, high-voltage transmission tower/truss was destroyed, and numerous power poles were snapped. Many trees were snapped or uprooted in the path. Trees in several areas were reduced to shortened trunks with short stumps where large limbs previously existed. Based on this damage, maximum estimated wind in this segment of the tornado was 140 to 150 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Four tornadoes occurred with these storms during the afternoon, all of them in the Eckley and Wray area.  Three of the four tornadoes lasted less than 10 minutes.  The strongest and most destructive tornado developed on the northwest side of Wray and moved north-northeast.  There were no fatalities with this tornado, but there were 4 minor injuries.  Large hail also occurred with some of these storms.  The largest hail stone was 2.5 in diameter which fell near Alvin.  The strongest severe wind gust was estimated to be 65 MPH reported north of Seibert.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado developed just north of the Wray airport.  It remained semi-stationary for the first few minutes of its lifetime before moving north.  The tornado crossed Highway 385 just north of the CR 39 intersection.  As it crossed the highway it strewed barb wire fencing across the road, picked up a semi and the attached trailer, tossing them east of the highway.  Cargo from the trailer was blown across the highway.  A tractor parked near the highway was flipped on its side at this same location.  Near this same location a mobile home had the roof removed by the tornado.  Law enforcement reported around 40 electrical poles were down due to the tornado.  According to law enforcement four people impacted by the tornado had minor injuries.  The tornado's path was in the rural areas north of Wray.  The tornado ended before reaching CR 45 east of Highway 385.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 135.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It remained semi-stationary for the first few minutes of its lifetime before moving north.  The tornado crossed Highway 385 just north of the CR 39 intersection.  As it crossed the highway it strewed barb wire fencing across the road, picked up a semi and the attached trailer, tossing them east of the highway.  Cargo from the trailer was blown across the highway.  A tractor parked near the highway was flipped on its side at this same location.  Near this same location a mobile home had the roof removed by the tornado.  Law enforcement reported around 40 electrical poles were down due to the tornado.  According to law enforcement four people impacted by the tornado had minor injuries.  The tornado's path was in the rural areas north of Wray.  The tornado ended before reaching CR 45 east of Highway 385.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 135.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ���It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn���t go back.���||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged. In the worst cases, sections of road bed were washed away.  Public bridges and small private bridges were damaged or destroyed. Large debris piles collected against bridges. Countless vehicles were flooded.  Electricity and water were lost for days in the hardest hit flood areas.         ||The American Red Cross had over 800 workers helping at its peak.  They distributed over 7,500 cleanup kits and over 100,000 meals and snacks.  Many church based organizations and ordinary individual citizens volunteered their time and services to help in the flood recovery.  Nationally known celebrities and sport figures, with ties to West Virginia, also helped to raise awareness and increase donations for flood recovery.||The state transportation secretary estimated 8 million dollars in damage to roads in Clay County, 8 million dollars in Nicholas, over 13 million in Kanawha County.||Several schools were severely damaged by flood waters. This included in Clay County, White Elementary and the county bus garage. In Kanawha County, Herbert Hoover High School, Clendenin Elementary, Elk Valley Christian School, plus Bridge Elementary Schools were severely damaged.  Water from the Elk River crested about 7 feet deep in the first flood at Herbert Hoover High School. In Nicholas County. Richwood High and Middle School was severely damaged.  Moderate flood damage occurred to Clay High School and Elkview Middle School.  Minor flood damage occurred at Middle Birch Elementary School in Braxton County.  Minor flood damage also was seen in Ansted Elementary in Fayette County and Glade Elementary in Webster County.||A state of emergency was declared by Governor Tomblin.  At its peak deployment, around 650 members of the West Virginia Army National Guard and West Virginia Air National Guard were activated.  Major tasks assigned to the guard troops included delivering supplies to residents with no road access, and removal of flood debris.  Private contractors were also used for debris removal. In just Kanawha County, 15,000 tons of flood debris were collected.       ||A federal disaster was quickly declared by President Obama.  At least 8 counties were eligible from the events of June 23rd and 24th within the forecast area of the National Weather Service in Charleston.

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ���It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn���t go back.���||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged. In the worst cases, sections of road bed were washed away.  Public bridges and small private bridges were damaged or destroyed. Large debris piles collected against bridges. Countless vehicles were flooded.  Electricity and water were lost for days in the hardest hit flood areas.         ||The American Red Cross had over 800 workers helping at its peak.  They distributed over 7,500 cleanup kits and over 100,000 meals and snacks.  Many church based organizations and ordinary individual citizens volunteered their time and services to help in the flood recovery.  Nationally known celebrities and sport figures, with ties to West Virginia, also helped to raise awareness and increase donations for flood recovery.||The state transportation secretary estimated 8 million dollars in damage to roads in Clay County, 8 million dollars in Nicholas, over 13 million in Kanawha County.||Several schools were severely damaged by flood waters. This included in Clay County, White Elementary and the county bus garage. In Kanawha County, Herbert Hoover High School, Clendenin Elementary, Elk Valley Christian School, plus Bridge Elementary Schools were severely damaged.  Water from the Elk River crested about 7 feet deep in the first flood at Herbert Hoover High School. In Nicholas County. Richwood High and Middle School was severely damaged.  Moderate flood damage occurred to Clay High School and Elkview Middle School.  Minor flood damage occurred at Middle Birch Elementary School in Braxton County.  Minor flood damage also was seen in Ansted Elementary in Fayette County and Glade Elementary in Webster County.||A state of emergency was declared by Governor Tomblin.  At its peak deployment, around 650 members of the West Virginia Army National Guard and West Virginia Air National Guard were activated.  Major tasks assigned to the guard troops included delivering supplies to residents with no road access, and removal of flood debris.  Private contractors were also used for debris removal. In just Kanawha County, 15,000 tons of flood debris were collected.       ||A federal disaster was quickly declared by President Obama.

A very mild and unstable air mass was in place along with a strong southwesterly upper level jet.  These ingredients combined with a cold front and pre-frontal trough sweeping from west to east across the area sparked scattered supercell thunderstorms during the evening, a few of which were tornadic.  This was followed by a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) that occurred with the trough, which also was responsible for severe weather.  Beneficial rainfall occurred with this system with 2-5 inches reported.  Some of the rainfall fell fast enough to produce brief flash flooding in the Florence area during the evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The assessment team was able to connect the previous Rosalie track to the Ider track after observing significant roof damage to single family home with complete destruction to a barn on the property near the intersection of CR-345 and CR-78. Additional points were added along CR-330 to CR-117 (DeKalb Co.) after the team recorded snapped softwood and hardwood trees and damage to a large anchored shed.||Significant damage was observed from the tornado along CR-117 and CR-159. Numerous hardwood and softwood trees were either uprooted or snapped at the |trunk along CR-117 leading up to CR-159. The strongest winds of this tornado were recorded near this location. A one story day care center was completely destroyed and blown off its foundation. Preliminary info recorded 10 injuries at this location. The damage assessment team noted the structure was bolted the foundation, however the floor plates connecting to the foundation were observed to have some degree of degradation. This led to a preliminary assessment of a tornado of EF-3 strength with winds approximately 145 mph. *Update: of the 10 injuries, one individual has since passed away on 2/8/17. ||Between CR-117 and AL-75 in DeKalb County, numerous chicken farms were completely destroyed along. Several homes in the area sustained significant roof damage and two anchored mobiles homes were observed to have rolled. One unanchored mobile home was completely destroyed with scattered debris. ||Finally, the team traveled along CR-792 in the Deer Head Cove area (near the AL/GA|state line) and observed complete destruction to a well anchored and large metal |shed. Winds were estimated to be 111 MPH at this location. Numerous soft wood pine trees were snapped or uprooted up to the AL/GA state line.

Additional points were added along CR-330 to CR-117 (DeKalb Co.) after the team recorded snapped softwood and hardwood trees and damage to a large anchored shed.||Significant damage was observed from the tornado along CR-117 and CR-159. Numerous hardwood and softwood trees were either uprooted or snapped at the |trunk along CR-117 leading up to CR-159. The strongest winds of this tornado were recorded near this location. A one story day care center was completely destroyed and blown off its foundation. Preliminary info recorded 10 injuries at this location. The damage assessment team noted the structure was bolted the foundation, however the floor plates connecting to the foundation were observed to have some degree of degradation. This led to a preliminary assessment of a tornado of EF-3 strength with winds approximately 145 mph. *Update: of the 10 injuries, one individual has since passed away on 2/8/17. ||Between CR-117 and AL-75 in DeKalb County, numerous chicken farms were completely destroyed along. Several homes in the area sustained significant roof damage and two anchored mobiles homes were observed to have rolled. One unanchored mobile home was completely destroyed with scattered debris. ||Finally, the team traveled along CR-792 in the Deer Head Cove area (near the AL/GA|state line) and observed complete destruction to a well anchored and large metal |shed. Winds were estimated to be 111 MPH at this location. Numerous soft wood pine trees were snapped or uprooted up to the AL/GA state line. The team traveled into|nearby Dade County, observed minor debris, but no damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A double wide mobile home was completely destroyed and an adjacent church roof was heavily damaged. The tornado passed through a grove of trees snapping nearly all of them halfway up the trunk. The strong tornado passed through a farm and caused significant damage to a two story family home. This part of the tornado path was determined to be at the high end of the EF-2 rating. As the tornado continued along a northeasterly track, two additional homes were heavily damaged before moving along an unpopulated ridge. The tornado likely skipped along this ridge as it crossed Highway 127 and then crossed Highway 111. A mobile home roof was completely removed near the corner of Shell Road and Tri Mile Road along with numerous trees that were either uprooted or snapped. The damage track seemed to end near Snow Bird Lane and Raven Cliff Road. Rear flank downdraft damage was noted farther east along Lewis Chapel Road to about Laurelwood Trail. Major roof damage was seen along Natures Trail and Lewis Chapel Road where winds were estimated around 100 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Widespread heavy rain developed on October 8th and continued through early on October 9th as Matthew approached and moved offshore of the coast. Rainfall ranged from 2 to 4 inches on the southern beaches to 8 to 12 inches inland. This rain led to significant flash flooding over  much of eastern North Carolina during the afternoon of October 8th through the morning of October 9th. Many roads were washed out and impassable for days from the serious flash flooding. Devastating river flooding then occurred several days after Matthew as most main-stem rivers exceeded major flood levels. Strong winds of 40 to 60 mph inland and 60 to 80 mph along the coast occurred as Matthew passed offshore mainly during the evening of October 8th through the morning of the 9th. These winds led to numerous downed trees and power lines across the region with widespread power outages that lasted several days in some areas. Storm surge inundation was mainly 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the coast, however inundation of 3 to 5 feet above ground level was observed on the sound side of the Outer Banks. ||There were six confirmed fatalities across the area with five in Lenoir County and one in Pitt County. Dollar damages totals have not been completed but will likely exceed 200 million dollars with significant agricultural losses.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Car drove into severe flooding near Mozingo Road near V A O site C road.

There were 15 fatalities in Greenbrier County and widespread catastrophic damage across much of the county. Summers and Monroe counties had much less severe flash flooding. ||The two days prior to the event were quite wet as several rounds of thunderstorms traversed the area with rainfall of roughly 1 to 2 inches across much of Greenbrier County in the 48 hours ending at 0800 EDT on June 23rd. This left the ground quite moist and primed for more efficient runoff.  The synoptic setup for this event featured an upper level ridge over the central U.S. northwest flow across the eastern U.S. Several strong short-waves topped the ridge and dropped southeast across the Ohio Valley toward the central Appalachians with the strongest wave approaching on the morning of the 23rd of June. Satellite imagery showed a deep tap of tropical moisture into West Virginia and a strengthening upper level jet providing additional lift. A warm front was located just north of the area and became a focus for convection in the early morning hours of the 23rd. Up to an inch of rain had fallen across Summers and Greenbrier by 730 AM EDT. Late in the morning, renewed convection from the west entered the area. During the late morning to early afternoon convection continued to train across the same general area of southeast WV and far western VA with hourly rainfall rates of 1.50 to 2. One of the more reliable automated rain gauges at White Sulphur Springs, WV (SUPW2) measured 2.32 and 1.89 in consecutive hours from 1 to 3 PM EDT or 4.21 in 2 hours. The 2-hour, 1000-year ARI at this location per NOAA Atlas 14 is 3.88��� giving an indication of the intensity of the rain.   Toward the end of this time window is when intense flash flooding began across eastern parts of the county but earlier in the far west. Flash Flood Warnings (FFWs) were issued throughout the morning and afternoon and a rare Flash Flood Warning Emergency product was issued  for Greenbrier County by the NWS at 441 PM EDT as the extent of the disaster became apparent. ||Radar and rain gauge measurements showed as much as 8 to 10 inches (perhaps higher locally) fell in a band across central Greenbrier County. The bulk of the rain fell in less than 12 hours between 600 AM and 600 PM. The top five official rain gauge totals (24-hour amounts ending at 8 AM EDT, June 24th) included White Sulphur Springs COOP (WSUW2) 8.29, Lewisburg 3N COOP (LWBW2) 8.00, White Sulphur Springs DCP (SUPW2) 7.83, McCross 3E COOP (MCRW2) 6.54 and Williamsburg VFD IFLOWS (WMBW2) 5.37.  One personal weather station at Maxwelton measured 9.37 and there were several anecdotal reports of 10 or more inches. The 24-hour rainfall at White Sulphur Springs COOP, with fairly complete data back to around 1920 (and sporadic  back to 1888) was more than double the all-time daily record (4.00��� set in March, 1890). Lewisburg 3N COOP with data all the way back to around 1900 also demolished its all-time daily record of 4.06��� set in July, 1954. A point event analysis by the Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center (HDSC) indicated that the rainfall was in the .001 Annual Exceedance Probability (1,000 year Annual Recurrence Interval, or ARI) for a 24-hour period.||The gauged hydrologic response was astounding as small creeks fed rivers that rose almost like a flash flood. An IFLOWS river gage at Ronceverte (RONW2) on the Greenbrier River rose to flood stage of 15 feet by around 730 PM EDT and climbed another 8.2 feet by 1130 PM. The NWS forecast point on Greenbrier River at Alderson (ALDW2) rose very slowly through the afternoon of the 23rd but around 700 PM EDT massive runoff began reaching the USGS gage location. The river rose from just over 4 feet (discharge of 2,300 cfs or cubic ft. per second) at 700 PM to reach flood stage of 14 feet (40,000 cfs) just 2.5 hours later around 930 PM. The river continued an astronomical rate of rise reaching Major Flood Stage (19 feet, 63,000 cfs) by midnight June 24th, before cresting at 22 feet (80,700 cfs) at 430 AM EDT. This was the 3rd highest crest on record (data back to 1895) at Alderson, surpassed only by the January 1996 rain/snowmelt flood and November 1985 flood. According to the latest available USGS report on flood frequency for West Virginia streams the discharge at the Alderson gage was very close to the 0.01 Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) or 100-year annual recurrence interval. A similar extreme response occurred on the Greenbrier River at the Hilldale USGS gage (HLLW2) downstream of Alderson just above the confluence with the New River. It also had its 3rd highest crest (25.45 feet, Flood Stage 16 ft) and discharge (82,508 cfs) on record (data back to 1936) and was also very close to the .01 AEP or 100-year event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Unprecedented flash flooding occurred across large parts of Greenbrier County but especially in a swath across the central part of the county where an estimated 6 to 10 inches of rain fell in less than 12 hours. The first flood-related report was received at 100 PM EDT (1200 PM EST) as a portion of Highway 20 in western Greenbrier County became impassable south of Quinwood due to a mudslide and debris in the road. By 130 PM (1230 EST) there were several reports of flash flooding in the community of Rupert which required the evacuation of a nursing home and a vehicle rescue. Portions of Route 60 were closed between Rainelle and Rupert and severe flash flooding occurred along Big Clear Creek, a tributary of the Meadow River just north of Rupert. A number of homes of homes were badly damaged or destroyed along Big Clear Creek and several water rescues required in the Rupert area. The first flooding reports out of Rainelle in far western Greenbrier County were received at 155 PM (1255 EDT) and described people being trapped in cars and numerous water rescues. Several creeks emerge from the higher terrain surrounding Rainelle and converge in or near the town (Wolfpen Creek, Boggs Creek, Little Sewell Creek), the largest of which is Sewell Creek which then joins the Meadow River just northeast of town. The IFLOWS gage on the Meadow River near Hines (HNEW2) rose rapidly above its Flood Stage of 14 feet by 200 PM EDT and reached Major Flood Stage of 18 feet just two hours later, shortly before it ceased functioning at a stage of 18.8 feet while still rising. Flooding along the Meadow River was extensive with numerous homes and businesses affected. In addition, the rising Meadow River prevented Sewell Creek in Rainelle from discharging into the Meadow River which likely contributed to the rapidly rising water levels in Rainelle. Flooding was catastrophic in the town with water up to 8 feet deep or more and numerous homes flooded. There were four fatalities in Rainelle and three in Rupert, all due to asphyxiation (drowning). ||Meanwhile, numerous flood reports continued to be received although the 911 center and Emergency Management were completely overwhelmed with calls. The Greenbrier County Sheriff described 'complete chaos' across the county in a media report as dozens of roads were closed, damaged or destroyed and many water rescues were made from cars and structures. Especially hard hit was the White Sulphur Springs area in the eastern part of the county. Several small streams also descend rapidly from higher surrounding terrain and converge in or near White Sulphur Springs including Dry Creek and Wades Creek which join Howard Creek in the town, which itself is a large tributary of the Greenbrier River. All were transformed into raging torrents which tore through parts of the town taking trees, cars and even homes downstream. One of the more horrifying images was of a burning home being carried downstream on Howard Creek before colliding with a bridge. This creek runs through portions of the famous Greenbrier Resort and images of the normally tranquil stream converted into a massive river covering portions of the golf course were widely shared on social and conventional media. Howard Creek flooded long stretches of U.S. Highway 60 downstream of White Sulphur Springs, causing severe damage all along the way to its confluence with the Greenbrier River at Caldwell, six miles downstream. Parts of Route 60 were essentially destroyed and probably dozens of cars were swept into the creek and deposited along the way. There were seven fatalities in and around the White Sulphur Springs area, all but one from drowning. One person's body was found some 30 miles downstream on the Greenbrier River from where she was believed to have been swept into a creek that feeds the river. The body of a teenage girl from White Sulphur Springs was not found for over 6 weeks, eventually winding up in the Caldwell area on the Greenbrier River. There was significant flooding all along the Greenbrier River with Caldwell, Ronceverte and Alderson the hardest hit as the river rose at near flash-flood rates and crested in the Major Flood category (see Episode for details). Numerous homes were flooded in the town of Alderson (Pop: 1184), according to the Mayor. A state of emergency was declared for a number of counties in West Virginia during and after the event and a Major Federal Disaster for over  dozen counties was declared on June 25, 2016 by the President of the U.S. Fatalities in the county totaled 15 with an unknown number of injuries. There was over $5.5 million in public road/bridge damage in Greenbrier County and substantial damage to private roads and bridges. Preliminary data showed 319 homes destroyed and 353 damaged across the county, mostly in the Rainelle and White Sulphur Springs areas. In addition, 12 businesses were destroyed and 20 damaged along with numerous motor vehicles destroyed. Final damage totals for the event are not available from Emergency Management officials as of this writing but an estimate $40 million may not be unreasonable.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ���It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn���t go back.���||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged. In the worst cases, sections of road bed were washed away.  Public bridges and small private bridges were damaged or destroyed. Large debris piles collected against bridges. Countless vehicles were flooded.  Electricity and water were lost for days in the hardest hit flood areas.         ||The American Red Cross had over 800 workers helping at its peak.  They distributed over 7,500 cleanup kits and over 100,000 meals and snacks.  Many church based organizations and ordinary individual citizens volunteered their time and services to help in the flood recovery.  Nationally known celebrities and sport figures, with ties to West Virginia, also helped to raise awareness and increase donations for flood recovery.||The state transportation secretary estimated 8 million dollars in damage to roads in Clay County, 8 million dollars in Nicholas, over 13 million in Kanawha County.||Several schools were severely damaged by flood waters. This included in Clay County, White Elementary and the county bus garage. In Kanawha County, Herbert Hoover High School, Clendenin Elementary, Elk Valley Christian School, plus Bridge Elementary Schools were severely damaged.  Water from the Elk River crested about 7 feet deep in the first flood at Herbert Hoover High School. In Nicholas County. Richwood High and Middle School was severely damaged.  Moderate flood damage occurred to Clay High School and Elkview Middle School.  Minor flood damage occurred at Middle Birch Elementary School in Braxton County.  Minor flood damage also was seen in Ansted Elementary in Fayette County and Glade Elementary in Webster County.||A state of emergency was declared by Governor Tomblin.  At its peak deployment, around 650 members of the West Virginia Army National Guard and West Virginia Air National Guard were activated.  Major tasks assigned to the guard troops included delivering supplies to residents with no road access, and removal of flood debris.  Private contractors were also used for debris removal. In just Kanawha County, 15,000 tons of flood debris were collected.       ||A federal disaster was quickly declared by President Obama.  At least 8 counties were eligible from the events of June 23rd and 24th within the forecast area of the National Weather Service in Charleston. They included Jackson, Roane, Kanawha, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties.  See FEMA disaster number 4273-DR for more information.  Over 4900 individuals applied for federal assistance from those 8 counties, totaling over 20 million dollars.  Public assistance for debris removal, emergency protective services, roads, bridges, and schools, was over 50 million dollar in those same 8 counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flash flooding occurred in scattered locations, mostly in the northern half of the county.  In Ravenswood, a small stream along Utah Road called Lick Run is usually ankle deep. It rose 6 feet. A 4 year old toddler slipped into the water. The grandfather jumped in, but could not rescue him. His body was found the following day, about a quarter mile away. ||A preliminary damage assessment was done in this county.  It had 10 homes destroyed and about 2 dozen with damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Satellite imagery showed a deep tap of tropical moisture into West Virginia and a strengthening upper level jet providing additional lift. A warm front was located just north of the area and became a focus for convection in the early morning hours of the 23rd. During the late morning to early afternoon convection continued to train across the same general area of southeast WV and far western VA with hourly rainfall rates of 1.50 to 2 for several hours.||Radar and rain gauge measurements showed as much as 4 to 8 inches (perhaps higher locally) fell in a band across central Alleghany County. The bulk of the rain fell in less than 12 hours between 600 AM and 600 PM EDT. The Governor of Virginia declared a state of emergency in the City of Covington and Alleghany County.||The phenomenal runoff from creeks, streams and overland flow produced an extreme hydrologic response on larger rivers including the Jackson River. The river gage at Covington (CVGV2) rose over 10 feet in 5 hours to reach Flood Stage (17 feet) for the first time since September 2004 (during the remains of Hurricane Jeanne).  A River Flood Warning (FLW) was issued at 609 PM as the river was near 15 feet and the crest was only 4.5 hours later at 22.33 feet just below the Major Flood Stage of 23 feet. This was highest stage reached at the Covington gage since the November 1985 flood (23.31 feet) and 2nd highest since the construction of Gathright Dam in 1979. Gathright Dam was built to reduce flooding on the Jackson River but so much rain fell in the watershed below the dam that flooding still occurred at Covington. Numerous homes and several businesses in Covington suffered severe flood damage from the Jackson River.  At the same time Dunlap Creek (DLPV2), which drains 162 mi2 of western Alleghany County and empties into the Jackson River in Covington was also rising at an extreme rate, climbing from a stage of around 3 feet (445 cfs) at 200 PM to a record stage of 16.49 feet (30,300 cfs) in a little over 6 hours.  The previous record at this gage was 15.65 feet (27,400 cfs) set in June 1972 with the remains of Hurricane Agnes. Hydrological peak stage records at this gage date back to 1929. According to USGS flood frequency reports this flood was likely in excess of a 200-year (0.005 AEP) event on Dunlap Creek. There was extensive flooding along Dunlap Creek with roads and homes flooded and some requiring evacuations. Flooding continued downstream and a few hours later a River Flood Warning was issued for the upper James River including the forecast points at Lick Run (LIRV2) and Buchanan (BNNV2) both of which easily reached flood stage. At Lick Run the crest of 22.84 feet was the 10th highest on record (continuous records since 1925) and the highest since January 1996 (25.03 feet).  Per USGS data the 48,000 cfs discharge at Lick Run was roughly a 10-year (.10 AEP) flood event. At Buchanan the 42,900 cfs was merely somewhere between a 2- to 5-year event (0.5 to 0.2 AEP).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flash flooding was first reported in Alleghany County at 215 PM EDT (115 PM EST) as Indian Draft Road (Route 600) was closed. Numerous additional reports and social media reports continued to be received through the afternoon. Numerous small streams flooded including Wilson Creek which overflowed Route 629 (Douthat Park Road). The most serious flooding was along Dunlap Creek with runs through the southwestern portions of the county joining the Jackson River just north of Covington. More than 25 homes were badly damaged in the county most of them along Dunlap Creek which set a new flood of record (see Episode for details). Water was reported over Route 60 from Dunlap Creek in several areas. Two water rescues by boat were performed and several landslides were reported including one that was reported to have closed Pitzer Ridge Road (Route 657) east of Route 18.

Another person drowned south of Viroqua (Vernon County) when the driver of a truck pulling a cattle trailer attempted to drive through flood waters during the afternoon or evening of the 22nd. The truck and trailer became stuck in the flood waters, which filled the passenger compartment of the truck. The flooding occurred as several rounds of thunderstorms with heavy rain moved across southwest Wisconsin from the morning of September 21st into the morning of the 22nd. The heavy rain resulted in flash flooding across portions of Adams, Clark, Crawford, La Crosse, Monroe, Richland, Vernon and Trempealeau Counties. A train derailed near Ferryville (Crawford County) when the roadbed was washed away by flooding. Around 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled into the water from one of the locomotives. Two people had to be rescued near De Soto (Vernon County) and another in Sidie Hollow County Park southwest of Viroqua (Vernon County). Washouts and road closures occurred in Trempealeau, La Crosse, Vernon and Crawford Counties. In Vernon County alone, high water and flooding resulted in 90 road closures and 44 homes and business were destroyed. Public and private sector damages in Vernon County totaled almost $10 million. In Crawford County, 2 homes were destroyed with another 67 damaged with public and private sector damages totaling almost $5 million. Flooding on the Black River in Black River Falls (Jackson County) caused the hydroelectric dam to loose a gate when a large tree traveled over the dam. Several boats and docks that broke loose in Lake Arbutus also traveled over the dam. A state of emergency was declared in Clark, Crawford, Jackson and Vernon Counties. The Governor of Wisconsin declared a state of emergency for Adams, Clark, Crawford, Jackson, La Crosse, Monroe, Richland, Trempealeau and Vernon Counties. A federal disaster declaration was made for Adams, Clark, Crawford, Jackson, Juneau, La Crosse, Monroe and Vernon Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rain caused flash flooding to occur across much of Vernon County. One person was killed near Victory when a mudslide caused a home to slide down a hillside very early in the morning of the 22nd. Numerous other houses were damaged by rocks, debris and floodwaters in Victory when a culvert used to divert water around town became blocked. In and around De Soto, two people had to be rescued from flood waters and 15 people were evacuated from a trailer park. The flood waters also covered State Highway 35. Flooding along Coe Hollow Creek prompted officials to evacuate Sidie Hollow Park but not before one person had to be rescued. Flood waters from the Kickapoo River flooded the west side of La Farge and caused State Highway 131 to be closed both north and south of town. Flooding from the Kickapoo River also sent water spilling into Viola and Readstown. State Highway 82 was closed west of La Farge because of flood waters from Otter Creek. Street flooding occurred in Viroqua where the water was up to 4 feet deep on Main Street. A state of emergency was declared in the county and there were up to 90 roads closed due to flooding.

The main impact from these storms was flash flooding over Cheyenne, Decatur, Norton, and Graham counties where estimated rainfall amounts of up to ten inches fell.  Many roads in northern Cheyenne County had washouts three to four feet deep, with a few washouts eight to twelve feet deep.  Road crews had to remove silt off Highway 36 west of Bird City where water flowed over the road.  The worst of the flooding was over southern Norton and northern Graham counties where numerous roads were washed out and Lenora was flooded.  The flash flooding transitioned to flooding during the overnight hours as the moderate to heavy rainfall moved to the east.  Swift water rescues were conducted in southern Norton County.

One of these rescues involved a couple who under estimated the depth of the water over the highway and drove through the flood waters on Highway 9.  The vehicle was washed off the road and caught in a tree.  The couple escaped from the vehicle and climbed into the tree, remaining there until rescuers arrived.  There was one direct fatality from the flooding.  The individual was driving north from Graham County on county roads toward Lenora.  He drove into flood waters, under estimating their depth.  His vehicle was washed off the road.  His body was found a quarter mile away from the vehicle.  In general, the majority of the rainfall fell south of CR W.  Rainfall amounts of five to seven inches were common across southern Norton County.

The system tapped into deep tropical moisture resulting in very intense rainfall across a large portion of the area. Two-day rainfall totals of 10 inches or more were common across areas generally to the west and northwest of Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas. The heaviest rainfall occurred across a swath of East Baton Rouge, Livingston, and St. Helena Parishes, where 20 to 30 inches fell over a 48-hour period, topping the 0.1% annual exceedance probability. The heavy rainfall led to widespread flash flooding and record river flooding. Many of the broken records had been set during the flooding of April 1983. In total, 12 people died in southeast Louisiana as a result of the flooding. The event was also responsible for an estimated total of ten billion dollars in damage across southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi. This estimate includes impacts of both the initial flash flooding and the resultant river flooding.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Sixteen to twenty inches of rainfall over a 2 day period led to widespread flash flooding in St. Helena Parish. As water drained into area rivers, rapid rises and record flooding occurred along the Amite and Tickfaw Rivers. As floodwaters rose, numerous high water rescues were necessary across the parish. Road closures due to high water were common and over 400 homes and businesses suffered various degrees of damage. A section of Louisiana Highway 10 near the Coleman Town community was overtopped with some of the road washed out.  In Greensburg, flood waters rose high enough to enter the parish hospital. Two fatalities are attributed to the flash flooding. A 54 year old man drowned when his truck was submerged after being swept off a road east of Greensburg Friday afternoon. A 44 year old woman drowned when her vehicle was swept off Hwy 1045 near Montpelier Friday night.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 22.60M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Hot and humid conditions led to an unstable atmosphere. The instability along with the boundary caused a few severe thunderstorms to develop. Thunderstorms merged across Montgomery, Howard and Baltimore counties and led very heavy rainfall that led to flash flooding. Catastrophic flash flooding occurred in Ellicott City, MD the night of July 30th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The survey revealed clear signs of flooding both from the Patapsco River and from flash flooding within Ellicott City.  Signs of flooding, including damaged pavement, were observed as far up as the intersection of Rogers Avenue and Frederick Road, where Hudson Branch came out of its banks. From this location, eyewitnesses reported seeing water not only in the creek, but moving swiftly down Main Street beginning just after dark.  The intersection of Rogers Avenue and Frederick Road is about 140 feet higher in elevation than the lower part of Old Town Ellicott City. Erosion was noted on both the street side and the creek side of homes along Main Street in a portion of the 8500 block.||The next signs of damage were in the 8300 block of Main Street, with damage again observed both on the creek/river side and the street side of Main Street.  The creek/river side is where the most vehicles were impacted, in Lot D.||In the 8200 block, surveys and surveillance footage show water anywhere from 6 inches to two feet inside buildings on Main Street along with substantial damage to sidewalks and infrastructure outside the buildings.||The most significant damage observed was near 8100 Main Street, where the street curves slightly. Video surveillance footage reviewed after the event clearly indicates that water from the Tiber River was flowing through buildings on the south side of Main Street in this area, toward the street.||Closer to the Patapsco, damage continued with water marks observed 6-8 feet high on and in most buildings. The force of the floodwaters swept away the iconic Ellicott City clock as well as the historical flood marker that was attached to the railroad bridge.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 22.40M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The deputy was rushed to the hospital where he was hospitalized for kidney failure and other life-threatening problems associated with clinging to the tree in the flood waters. The deputy has since made a full recovery and returned to duty later that month.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This allowed a very warm and excessively humid air mass to be in place over the area.  As temperatures rose through the 80s and into the 90s, dewpoints were unusually high in the mid to upper 70s.  By the afternoon hours, this produced heat index values over 100 degrees in many valley areas, with some spots in the mid-Hudson Valley seeing heat index values approach 110 degrees.||At the same time, a surface cold front was approaching the area from the west.  Some clusters of thunderstorms developed in the early to mid afternoon hours across the Lake George-Saratoga Region, producing damage to trees and power lines.  In addition, one storm in the Lake George area contained a lightning strike, which injured multiple people huddled under a tree.||By the evening hours, a more organized line of thunderstorms moved from west to east across all of eastern Upstate New York.  This line produced widespread wind damage, with the most concentrated damage in the Pine Lake area of northwestern Fulton County. ||In addition to the gusty winds, the thunderstorms also produced a significant amount of cloud-to-ground lightning. Over 50,000 customers lost power at the height of the storms as a result of the gusty winds and lightning strikes.||Thunderstorms ended with the passage of the cold front during the overnight hours.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Fifteen people were injured at the Lake George Battlefield Park due to a lightning strike and needed to be hospitalized.

Upscale growth then occurred with storms forming into a quasi-linear convective system that pushed through central North Dakota and then the James River Valley. Strong thunderstorm winds accompanied the line of storms. Additional elevated storms then formed later in the night over southwest and south central North Dakota as a low level jet increased and an upper level trough approached, with storms continuing overnight.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A slow moving supercell resulted in an extended period of very large hail and damaging wind gusts in and around the city of Killdeer. Hail up to 3.25 inches in diameter completely covered the ground in many locations. The hail combined with wind gusts of 75 mph to cause extreme damage to buildings, trees, and vehicles in the city. At the Killdeer nursing home windows were broken out and four rooms were damaged to the point where they were not habitable. Two residents sustained minor injuries. The first was injured (direct injury) when they were struck by broken flying glass. The other person was injured (direct injury) as they were evacuating their living area due to broken windows and fell on a wet floor as rain and hail were pouring in. Every field light at the new football stadium was destroyed, and every bus at the school was significantly damaged.  Significant damage occurred to vehicles including those at a dealership.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
