While numerous reports of funnel clouds or tornado touchdowns were received, post-storm surveys from the air and ground indicated it was hard to distinguish tornado damage from strait line wind damage.

Millions of dollars in damage resulted from the biggest severe weather outbreak to affect the region in years.The storms began to develop early in the afternoon across north-central Wisconsin.  Hail the size of baseballs fell in Minocqua (Oneida co.), damaging nearly 200 vehicles.  As those storms moved southeast and weakened, a new supercell thunderstorm developed over Lincoln county.  This new storm produced wind damage in Tomahawk and softball size hail northeast of Merrill.  About 20 minutes later, a tornado developed in southeast Lincoln county and moved southeastward into Marathon county.  This tornado, rated F2, was on the ground for more than three miles.  It damaged several homes, vehicles and silos, and destroyed numerous barns, sheds and crops.  Twenty head of dairy cattle were killed or had to be destroyed.  As  the tornadic supercell moved southeast, it produced two other weak tornadoes.  Total damage to crops and property from five tornadoes, hail and straight-line winds in Marathon county alone topped $10 million.Another supercell thunderstorm produced a downburst swath of damage over three miles wide and 14 miles long from southeast Langlade county, through western Menominee county, into extreme north-central Shawano county.  Menominee county was especially hard hit, as tens of thousands of trees were felled in the heavily forested county.  Authorities estimated that nearly 25 million board feet of lumber was on the ground; it was hoped that much of it was going to be salvaged.  At the height of the storm, winds were estimated to be near 100 mph.  As the storm weakened and moved into north-central Shawano county, a 70 mph wind gust was measured near Morgan.  Another storm in western Shawano county produced a downburst which downed trees across the city of Wittenberg.  Part of a roof was blown off an apartment building in the downtown area, and several houses and businesses sustained damage from the fallen trees.  A Wittenberg man was injured by flying glass.  Lightning set a house on fire, destroying the second story, in the township of Germania.Another storm struck Waupaca county, producing high winds.  A power pole fell and hit a car in New London, injuring the driver.Shortly after 530 pm, a supercell thunderstorm produced numerous wind gusts over 65 mph across the Fox Valley, blowing over many trees, damaging buildings and causing a fatality.  A 36 year-old male was killed when a tree fell on his minivan in Oshkosh (Winnebago co.).  His young daughter was uninjured in the accident.  A wind gust to 82 mph was measured in Appleton (Outagamie co.), and a gust to 67 mph was recorded in Oshkosh.Thunderstorms over Waushara county produced flooding rains, a brief tornado, strong winds and hail.  Over five inches of rain fell in only three hours near Hancock, producing some basement and street flooding.  A brief tornado also touched down in an open field in Hancock.  Numerous trees and powerlines were blown down in Wautoma.A thunderstorm knocked trees and power lines down in Kiel (Calumet/Manitowoc co.), and damaged seven tents at a fair in Cleveland (Manitowoc co.).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The most impacting damage occurred in Frederick Co, where numerous trees and wires were blown down in the Winchester area.  One of those trees became an airborne missile, crashing through an automobile windshield and slightly injuring the 30-year old female driver.  In Clarke Co, several trees and large limbs were felled in the Berryville area, including one onto the historic home of George Washington's adopted daughter.  Numerous wires were reported down as well.Dozens of other trees and large limbs fell in western Loudoun co, northern Fauquier Co, and Arlington Co.  In western Loudoun Co, a large limb just missed striking a country inn; a picnic table was tossed from one yard to another.  The Northern Virginia Electric Cooperative reported 3800 customers were without power during the peak of the storm.  Some of the limbs that fell blocked roads; most notably federal route 340 near Berryville.In Arlington Co, a man and woman were struck by lightning in the Pentagon's parking lot; the man remained in serious condition that evening.  Large limbs fell onto the George Washington Parkway at Spout Run.

Two persons were injured in Mansfield Township when a tree came crashing down on the hood of their vehicle.  The other person, the son of a carnival worker, was injured by a flying limb in Hackettstown.   Numerous trees were uprooted.  Peak wind gusts averaged around 65 mph.  One thunderstorm caused wind damage in the southwestern part of the county in Harmony Township and  Phillipsburg.  The other thunderstorm caused a swath of damage in the northern half of the county in Allamuchy, Blairstown, Hackettstown, Hope, Independence, Knowlton and Mansfield Townships.Most of the structural damage to homes and vehicles were caused by fallen trees.  In Harmony Township, the damage was described as a disaster area.  Fallen trees closed three major roadways.  In Knowlton Township, the Clover Rest Home was evacuated because of downed wires.  In Hope Township, it was nearly impossible to find a piece of property that did not have wind damage.  Hardest hit were the Locust Lake Road and Mount Hermon Road areas.  One resident in that area had 17 uprooted trees on their property.  Most of the township also lost power.   The large cross on the roof of St John's Methodist Church was torn from the steeple and thrust into the church's roof.  At the Triple Brook Mobile Home Park, campers were overturned and tents were ripped.  The area was nearly evacuated.  In Phillipsburg, downed power lines started a house fire. In Hackettstown alone hundreds of trees were uprooted.  The steeple of the St. James Episcopal Church was damaged and a house on Grand Avenue suffered extensive wind damage.Throughout central and northwest New Jersey about 78,000 GPU customers lost power.  About 50,000 customers still had no power the morning of the 19th (Saturday).  The number was down to 16,000 the (Sunday) evening of the 20th (6,000  in Warren County), 1,000 the afternoon of the 21st (Monday) and the final 94 in Phillipsburg were back on line on the 22nd (Tuesday).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The front initiated many severe thunderstorms and three tornadoes in Columbia County.  In Columbia County near Copake Lake, an F1 tornado produced minor damage to two houses, scattered parts of a barn across county highway 7A  and downed many trees and wires.  In Columbia County near Canaan, two tornadoes produced extensive damage.  The F1 tornado formed just southwest of Beebe Pond, moved northeast and terminated near the intersection of state routes 295 and 22.  The tornado damaged several residences and moved a car port.  The F2  tornado initiated near the intersection of state routes 295 and 22 and moved eastward across the New York border into Berkshire County Massachusetts where it ended as an F1 tornado.  At the County Caretaker Lawn and Garden Center, four large greenhouses incurred structural damage.  On Shaker Ridge Road, a newly constructed three story home had the roof completely blown off along with the rear exterior wall.  The detached garage was blown off the foundation and destroyed.  Since this area is forested, many trees and wires were downed by the tornadoes resulting in power outages.  At the South Albany Airport near Selkirk, thunderstorm winds destroyed a Cessna 172 and a vintage1940's Luscombe 8E.  The winds also ripped a roof off a garage and downed several trees.  In Schoharie County at Charlotteville, straight line winds rolled over a mobile home with five people inside.  A  second mobile home which was unoccupied was lifted on top of the rolled over mobile home.  The five people sustained  injuries.  In Rensselaer County at Stephentown, thunderstorm winds lifted a barn and dropped it on East Road.  Many trees and power lines were also downed by the wind.  The thunderstorms also produced hail in parts of Schoharie, Washington, Albany and Columbia Counties.  A combination of damaging winds and lightning, left fifteen to twenty thousand people without power across eastern New York.  A lifeguard at the Northhampton Beach State Campsite in Northville was struck by lightning.  The individual was hospitalized and released with no serious injuries.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The second line of thunderstorms moved over the area during the evening.  For the day, these thunderstorms caused two deaths and 24 injuries.Both lines of severe thunderstorms produced high winds.  In addition, the first line produced large hail.Here are selected wind gusts from Western Suffolk County with the passage of the first line:o  60 mph at both Babylon and Farmingdale Airport.o  58 mph at Bohemia.Significant structural damage (several roofs were blown off businesses) resulted in five injuries in Deer Park.

Millions of dollars in damage resulted from the biggest severe weather outbreak to affect the region in years.The storms began to develop early in the afternoon across north-central Wisconsin.  Hail the size of baseballs fell in Minocqua (Oneida co.), damaging nearly 200 vehicles.  As those storms moved southeast and weakened, a new supercell thunderstorm developed over Lincoln county.  This new storm produced wind damage in Tomahawk and softball size hail northeast of Merrill.  About 20 minutes later, a tornado developed in southeast Lincoln county and moved southeastward into Marathon county.  This tornado, rated F2, was on the ground for more than three miles.  It damaged several homes, vehicles and silos, and destroyed numerous barns, sheds and crops.  Twenty head of dairy cattle were killed or had to be destroyed.  As  the tornadic supercell moved southeast, it produced two other weak tornadoes.  Total damage to crops and property from five tornadoes, hail and straight-line winds in Marathon county alone topped $10 million.Another supercell thunderstorm produced a downburst swath of damage over three miles wide and 14 miles long from southeast Langlade county, through western Menominee county, into extreme north-central Shawano county.  Menominee county was especially hard hit, as tens of thousands of trees were felled in the heavily forested county.  Authorities estimated that nearly 25 million board feet of lumber was on the ground; it was hoped that much of it was going to be salvaged.  At the height of the storm, winds were estimated to be near 100 mph.  As the storm weakened and moved into north-central Shawano county, a 70 mph wind gust was measured near Morgan.  Another storm in western Shawano county produced a downburst which downed trees across the city of Wittenberg.  Part of a roof was blown off an apartment building in the downtown area, and several houses and businesses sustained damage from the fallen trees.  A Wittenberg man was injured by flying glass.  Lightning set a house on fire, destroying the second story, in the township of Germania.Another storm struck Waupaca county, producing high winds.  A power pole fell and hit a car in New London, injuring the driver.Shortly after 530 pm, a supercell thunderstorm produced numerous wind gusts over 65 mph across the Fox Valley, blowing over many trees, damaging buildings and causing a fatality.  A 36 year-old male was killed when a tree fell on his minivan in Oshkosh (Winnebago co.).  His young daughter was uninjured in the accident.  A wind gust to 82 mph was measured in Appleton (Outagamie co.), and a gust to 67 mph was recorded in Oshkosh.Thunderstorms over Waushara county produced flooding rains, a brief tornado, strong winds and hail.  Over five inches of rain fell in only three hours near Hancock, producing some basement and street flooding.  A brief tornado also touched down in an open field in Hancock.  Numerous trees and powerlines were blown down in Wautoma.A thunderstorm knocked trees and power lines down in Kiel (Calumet/Manitowoc co.), and damaged seven tents at a fair in Cleveland (Manitowoc co.).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Millions of dollars in damage resulted from the biggest severe weather outbreak to affect the region in years.The storms began to develop early in the afternoon across north-central Wisconsin.  Hail the size of baseballs fell in Minocqua (Oneida co.), damaging nearly 200 vehicles.  As those storms moved southeast and weakened, a new supercell thunderstorm developed over Lincoln county.  This new storm produced wind damage in Tomahawk and softball size hail northeast of Merrill.  About 20 minutes later, a tornado developed in southeast Lincoln county and moved southeastward into Marathon county.  This tornado, rated F2, was on the ground for more than three miles.  It damaged several homes, vehicles and silos, and destroyed numerous barns, sheds and crops.  Twenty head of dairy cattle were killed or had to be destroyed.  As  the tornadic supercell moved southeast, it produced two other weak tornadoes.  Total damage to crops and property from five tornadoes, hail and straight-line winds in Marathon county alone topped $10 million.Another supercell thunderstorm produced a downburst swath of damage over three miles wide and 14 miles long from southeast Langlade county, through western Menominee county, into extreme north-central Shawano county.  Menominee county was especially hard hit, as tens of thousands of trees were felled in the heavily forested county.  Authorities estimated that nearly 25 million board feet of lumber was on the ground; it was hoped that much of it was going to be salvaged.  At the height of the storm, winds were estimated to be near 100 mph.  As the storm weakened and moved into north-central Shawano county, a 70 mph wind gust was measured near Morgan.  Another storm in western Shawano county produced a downburst which downed trees across the city of Wittenberg.  Part of a roof was blown off an apartment building in the downtown area, and several houses and businesses sustained damage from the fallen trees.  A Wittenberg man was injured by flying glass.  Lightning set a house on fire, destroying the second story, in the township of Germania.Another storm struck Waupaca county, producing high winds.  A power pole fell and hit a car in New London, injuring the driver.Shortly after 530 pm, a supercell thunderstorm produced numerous wind gusts over 65 mph across the Fox Valley, blowing over many trees, damaging buildings and causing a fatality.  A 36 year-old male was killed when a tree fell on his minivan in Oshkosh (Winnebago co.).  His young daughter was uninjured in the accident.  A wind gust to 82 mph was measured in Appleton (Outagamie co.), and a gust to 67 mph was recorded in Oshkosh.Thunderstorms over Waushara county produced flooding rains, a brief tornado, strong winds and hail.  Over five inches of rain fell in only three hours near Hancock, producing some basement and street flooding.  A brief tornado also touched down in an open field in Hancock.  Numerous trees and powerlines were blown down in Wautoma.A thunderstorm knocked trees and power lines down in Kiel (Calumet/Manitowoc co.), and damaged seven tents at a fair in Cleveland (Manitowoc co.).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This storm produced a large swath of straight line wind damage as it crossed through the NW suburbs...the heart of downtown Houston...the ship channel...and the Bay Area communities.  When this storm crossed Loop 610 near US 290 on the NW side...radar indicated sufficient rotation for possible tornadoes.  This signature continued until the storm was over the downtown area.  While numerous reports of funnel clouds or tornado touchdowns were received, post-storm surveys from the air and ground indicated it was hard to distinguish tornado damage from strait line wind damage.  Storm spotters and emergency management officials reported widespread damage to windows, billboard and powerlines along the storms' path.  Eight minor injuries were reported from flying glass from blown in windows at two downtown office buildings.  In addition, HL&P reported up to 192,000 customers without power in the wake of the storm.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> 6 minor injuries due to flying broken glass at One Shell Plaza in downtown Houston.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 30K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Wind gusts were estimated in excess of 80 mph in Readington Township.  Downed trees caused most of the damage to homes and vehicles.   In Flemington, a driver suffered spine and head injuries after a tree landed on its vehicle.  In Readington Township, portions of the Interstate Iron Works building collapsed.  High winds damaged the roof and several sections fell inside the plant.  Eight main roads within the township were closed because of fallen trees.  An uprooted walnut tree pulled up a tombstone from 1863.  Trees came down on two occupied vehicles, but no one was hurt.  At least nine vehicles within the township were damaged by fallen trees.  In Clinton Township, there was considerable utility pole damage on U.S. Route 22.  Three occupied vehicles were hit by fallen trees, but there were no injuries.  The hardest hit streets in Clinton included Halsted, Lehigh and West Main.Throughout central and northwest New Jersey about 78,000 (out of a possible 490,000) GPU customers lost power.  About 50,000 customers still had no power the morning of the 19th (Saturday).  The number was down to 16,000 the (Sunday) evening of the 20th (9,000  in Hunterdon County), 1,000 the afternoon of the 21st (Monday) and the final 94 (in Warren County) were back on line on the 22nd (Tuesday).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The most notable damage occurred along the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay during the middle of the evening, when a microburst containing estimated winds of up to 90 mph destroyed two barns, and lifted a gas station pump canopy off its moorings, in Deale.The first event occurred in extreme northern Montgomery Co at around 4:15 PM, when a chapel at a religious summer camp was struck by lightning and burned to the ground.  Thankfully, campers were gone for the summer - normally the chapel would be filled at that hour.  About one hour later, lightning struck a 26-foot sailboat on the Chesapeake Bay just east of St Margarets, causing minor injuries to two men aboard.  The same storm produced gusty winds which caused at least two other vessels to become distressed.  One of the boats, an 18-footer, reportedly sank near Greenbury Point.Another cell moved into northern Montgomery Co at around 5:30 PM, dropping 3/4 to 7/8 inch diameter hail and knocking down small trees and large limbs in the Olney/Ashton area.  During the early evening hours, thunderstorms became a bit more organized across northern Maryland.  The line drifted south and east through the evening, producing frequent lightning, brief downpours, and several instances of damage.  In eastern Washington Co, at least four trees fell onto local roads between Sharpsburg and Hagerstown.  Soon after, numerous large limbs, some trees, and power lines were knocked down in the Whites Ferry area of Montgomery Co, as well as in portions of Frederick City.Additional damage occurred across northern Maryland between 7:15 and 8 PM.  In southern Carroll Co, a tree fell onto a house in Winfield.  At least a dozen medium-sized tree limbs fell near Eldersburg, where an observer recorded a gust of 69 mph.  In Baltimore Co, emergency management officials reported numerous trees, limbs, and power lines down, several blocking area roadways.  Two trees were blown down in neighboring Harford Co; other trees and large limbs were blown down in eastern Howard Co from Columbia to Ellicott City.Damage in Glen Burnie and the Linthicum area included at least 20 affected trees, a damaged shed and fence, and downed wires.  a man was slightly injured when a large limb fell onto his automobile in Glen Burnie.  Wind gusts at nearby BWI airport were as high as 53 mph.  The heavy rain may have contributed to a three-car pile up in Glen Burnie, in which all 15 passengers sustained minor injuries.  Excessive speed and hydroplaning were the likely culprits.In all, over 30,000 Maryland residents were without power as a result of the storms, including 28,800 in the Baltimore Gas and Electric service area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The northeast quarter of the county suffered the least damage.  Three persons were injured.  A 20-year-old man was seriously injured when he was buried by falling limbs at the Flanders Valley Golf Course in Mount Olive.  The damaging wind gusts injured a teenager by making her lose control of the vehicle she was driving and slammed it into a utility pole.  A 43-year-old woman was injured in Long Hill Township when a tree fell on her vehicle near the intersection of Mountain and Basking Ridge Roads.  One person was also injured in Flanders during the clean-up on Saturday.  Peak wind gusts were estimated at around 65 mph.  Most of the damage to homes and vehicles were caused by the fallen trees.  Several homes had trees come crashing through their roofs.  The downed trees and wires closed many roads.  The downed wires also ignited several fires.In Roxbury Township, over 100 trees were uprooted with Succasunna and Kenvil hit very hard.  Emergency personnel responded to 37 calls and there were about 30 small wire fires throughout the township.  A female driver and her passenger narrowly escaped injury after a tree fell on her vehicle.  One home in Succasunna lost its roof.  In Mount Olive Township, U.S. Route 206 was closed for 18 hours.  100 year old/50 foot high trees were uprooted throughout most of the township.  At least half of Mount Olive lost power.  According to published reports no areas within the township were "spared".  The wind was so strong it blew a 13 inch bass out of Budd Lake.  Most of the power was also out in Rockaway Township.  Downed trees closed four major roads in Mendham Township, 10 roads in Washington Township and 6 roads in Harding Township.  Emergency personnel responded to 175 calls in Long Hill Township.  The Morris County Municipal Utilities Authority issued mandatory water use restrictions to its 10,000 customers after the storms knocked out power to their wells.Throughout central and northwest New Jersey 78,000 of the 490,000 GPU customers lost power.  About 50,000 customers still had no power the morning of the 19th (Saturday).  The number was down to 16,000 the (Sunday) evening of the 20th and 1,000 the afternoon of the 21st (Monday).

The mobile home park is located one mile northeast of the U.S. Highway 131/Stadium Street (Business I-94) interchange.     One injury (a broken wrist) was caused when a microburst approximately 150 yards long and 50 yards wide struck the park. The first damage was noted on Stadium Street at the Burger King and Lee's Restaurant. Two light poles were downed at a Burger King restaurant. The Lee's Restaurant sign was broken with large fragments of 1 to 2 feet driven into the front siding of the restaurant. Some shingles and siding were also blown off.     To the northeast, about a dozen mobile homes were pushed off foundations or received major roof damage. Two homes were completely destroyed, one of which was tied down. In the tied down mobile home, the wind ripped off the upper portions of the home, leaving only debris and the flooring. Five people were in the home at the time of the incident, one of whom was a teenage male injured with a broken wrist. The second destroyed trailer was not tied down and the back half of the trailer was broken and twisted onto its side. Debris was blown over 1/4 mile away, where a 2X4 was embedded at a downward angle into the side of a home.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Reports of large hail, flash flooding, damaging severe winds, and four tornadoes were received.  The first tornado, and the only tornado that caused damage, moved from west of Wakita to south of Wakita in Grant County. Because the damage was limited to power poles and trees, the tornado was rated as F0. The second and third tornadoes, both brief and rated F0, were reported near Deer Creek (also in Grant County) by the county sheriff's office.  The fourth and final tornado was observed west of Blackwell in Kay County by a county spotter.  Once again, no damage resulted and the tornado was rated F0.Severe straight-line winds officially measured at up to 81 mph (near Weatherford in Custer County) caused widespread and extensive damage in portions of western Oklahoma.  Beckham and Custer Counties were particularly hard-hit with major damage in Erick, Sayre, Elk City, Arapaho, Weatherford, Binger, and Clinton. Other wind damage also occurred in Wakita and near Medford in Grant County, in Canute and Cordell in Washita County, and in Oklahoma City in Oklahoma County.The largest hail was reported southwest of Renfrow in Grant County, where hail as large as golf balls fell. Flash flooding also occurred as storms moved repeatedly across parts of north-central Oklahoma producing very heavy rain.  Reports of flash flooding were received from Grant County in and around Medford, most of southern Kay County, and Noble County near Red Rock and Perry.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Severe thunderstorm winds estimated at up to 90 mph caused widespread damage and one injury in Binger.

It produced high winds that caused scattered damage in several locations.  The heaviest damage occurred on Staten Island and in Jersey City, NJ.A survey was conducted on Staten Island later Tuesday afternoon.  It was determined that damage was caused by straight line winds.  A roof was blown off a two family house with damage occurring to several trees and a satellite dish.  Eyewitnesses stated that this damage occurred before the rain arrived from the thunderstorm.  A few eyewitnesses reported seeing funnel clouds.  It was determined that the damage was caused by a strong gust front about 10 miles in advance of the line of thunderstorms.  The funnel clouds reported were actually small vortices called "gustnadoes."  These vortices sometimes accompany strong gust fronts.Examples of damage include:For Staten Island:  The roof of a car dealership at 1590 Hyland Blvd. partially collapsed and caused damage to some vehicles in the back lot.For the Bronx:  A tree fell onto a house and utility cables at 5932 and 5934 Liebig Street.  The roof, windows, gutters, and sidewalks of both homes were damaged.For Manhattan:  The front support wall of a structure located at 327 West 112th Street collapsed.Two men were struck by lightning while on a roof in Yonkers (Westchester County).In other areas, thunderstorms produced high winds that downed trees and power lines.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The winds knocked down numerous trees and powerlines leaving the entire town without power.  The high winds were also blamed for blowing down a wall on an equipment building under construction along with the new Texas Department of transportation building on FM 1845.  The wall was 250 feet long and built with concrete blocks.  The winds sent trees up to 20 feet in diameter crashing into houses and carports which collapsed onto cars.  A 300 foot tower at Farmers Academy that serves Mt. Pleasant's cable TV system was blown over.  Ninety-five (95) percent of all the trees and tall structures above 30 feet in height fell to the southeast.  Minor damage occurred to a supermarket in town leaving the people trapped inside after the power went out.  At least 5 county roads were closed, two trailer homes were damaged significantly and one woman was injured when she was struck by a shopping chart at a grocery store.  In the city alone, at least 70 structures were damaged to some extent.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

No hail was reported, lightning was present and the rain was not heavy.  Wind damage was reported county wide with the more severe damage occurring in two separate tracks contained within ten miles either side of Interstate 16 west to east across the county.        The northernmost track of damage was to trees and buildings from Dudley eastward to approximately 3 miles east southeast of East Dublin.  This damage track ended near a helicopter hangar on Georgia Highway 29 south.  The hangar and helicopter inside were damaged.  A farm house, barn and out buildings a short distance away were also damaged.  Two large Pecan trees were pushed over in the same general area, and the tops of several trees were snapped off.        At approximately 1145 pm EDT, a mobile home located almost 2 miles east of Dexter was torn from its tie downs and blown off its blocks.  It rolled over onto two automobiles, which sustained heavy damages, and moved 30 to 40 feet away.  An eighteen month old girl sustained injuries, but was released from the hospital the next day.  This damage track continued eastward to Georgia Highway 199 south, about 9 miles southeast of East Dublin.  Here one mobile home was blown loose from its tie downs, tipped over on its side and was destroyed.  A nearby modular home was damaged when a large tree limb was blown onto it.  There were minor injuries at this location.  A woman was treated for a leg injury.  Additional damage was reported just off Georgia Highway 199.  A house was damaged and power lines snapped.  Tree limbs were also blocking the road.Upon inspection by a National Weather Service employee all damage was classified as straightline winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In Terry County, the Emergency Operations Center reported roof damage to mobile homes, along with trees and power poles down due to high wind.  Sixty-five to seventy mph wind gusts over Lubbock County caused a cinder block structure under construction to topple in the northern part of the city  of Lubbock at the Lubbock Country Club.   The high wind caused damage at Lubbock International Airport where a 30 square yard section of the terminal building was blown off and numerous power lines were also blown down.  The storms also caused one minor injury in Garza County where a truck driver had his unfilled 18-wheel truck blown off Highway 84.  An isolated thunderstorm over  the extreme southern Texas Panhandle produced small hail and strong wind that caused damage to crops in  Hall County near the town of Memphis.  Overall, approximately 100,000 acres of cotton were destroyed in Yoakum, Terry, and Hockley Counties due to small hail and strong wind.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A porch was blown down at a residence northeast of Lamont (Lafayette Co.).   Urban street flooding occurred in New Glarus due to 4.5 to 5.0 inches of rain in 3 hours.  No damage was noted due to this flooding.   Flag poles were bent and flags blown off in La Valle (Sauk Co.) besides the usual reports of large branches downed.    In the Spring Green area a couple farm outbuildings and a residence were damaged.   Strong thunderstorm winds split a large tree in in Chenequa (Waukesha Co.) which then fell on a residents porch and injured a woman.  Intense rainfall also resulted in urban street flooding in North Freedom  (Sauk Co.).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first tornado moved through mostly open country, flattening a few out buildings along it's 3.5 mile path.  The second formed as the first one dissipated, and continued moving east through Apple Valley, south of Waalew Road.  Damage was sporadic as this twister was rather narrow and did not make contact with the ground continuously.  Several power poles were blown down, small structures destroyed, and the roof was ripped off of a garage.  Arcing power lines set several blazes which were quickly extinguished by fire fighters.  A microburst followed, which ripped a 55 foot awning from a mobile home and blew it against a car, pinning, and slightly injuring a young girl.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The microburst, which had a width of about 1/3 mile, snapped hundreds of mainly soft  wood trees and large limbs.  However, some of the trees fell onto homes and vehicles, causing substantial damage.  In Potomac, a vehicle was crushed by a falling oak tree.  The driver, waiting out the storm along the side of a road, was killed instantly.  Numerous large limbs and dozens of small trees were snapped and/or uprooted in Potomac.Farther east, at least 50 trees and limbs were snapped, most of them evergreens, at the Bethesda Country Club.  Scattered light damage continued through North Chevy Chase, then damage increased again in the Woodside section of Silver Spring.   Unfortunately, at least four homes sustained substantial damage from fallen trees in Silver Spring.  The heaviest damage occurred at the intersection of Highland and Second Avenue, where three oak trees and limbs combined to cause major damage to one home whose second story was smashed to the ground.  The next-door neighbor's home had a snapped oak crash into its garage.  Damage to the other two homes was not quite as severe.  At the intersection of Spring Street and Second Ave., an uprooted locust tree smashed into the side wall, chimney, and roof.  Another home, located at the intersection of Georgia Ave. and Noyes Drive, suffered minor roof damage from a fallen tree.  An adjacent shed was crushed by a snapped large silver maple tree.The damage lightened up as the storm moved into the Takoma Park neighborhoods just east of Silver Spring.  In all, the combination of wind and lightning cut power to 37,500 customers in the Potomac Electric Power Co service area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A 53 year-old-male from Denville died of a heart attack after being hospitalized for injuries sustained from being hit by a four foot wide tree limb while retrieving the mail.  Morris County was the second hardest hit county in northwest New Jersey this afternoon.  There were so many downed wires along New Jersey State Route 10  that it looked like spaghetti to observers.  Trees fell across and blocked the southbound lanes of Interstate 287.  Mountain Lakes Borough had 36 reports of downed trees.  In Montville Township, a 100-year-old tree punched a hole in the roof of one home.  In Boonton Township one house was so badly damaged by fallen trees that authorities feared it might have to be condemned.  Numerous downed trees and wires were also reported in Chatham, Denville, Montville and Rockaway.  This squall line caused numerous power outages throughout the northern half of New Jersey as falling trees took down electrical wires.  About 97,000 GPU customers lost power that day and 16,000 customers in Sussex and Morris Counties still did not have power restored on the morning of the 18th.  Three thousand of these customers were in Montville Township.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Most of the wind damage occurred in the northeast half of the county.   Other reports of downed trees in the rest of the county came mainly from Greendell and Stillwater Township. A 64-year-old man was killed by a falling tree outside of his home in Green Township.  Franklin Borough was one of the hardest hit locations within the county.  A limited state of emergency was declared.  New Jersey State Route 23 was closed as were five other major roadways within the borough.  Several trees fell on and damaged homes.  Siding was ripped from a few homes and a couple of decks and railings were ripped away from other homes.  Part of Hardin Lumber's roof was blown away.  In addition to the wind damage, the frequent lightning ignited two houses on fire.  Sussex Borough was also hard hit and also declared a state of emergency.  Six major roads were closed because of fallen trees, some through the 17th.  A couple of planes at Sussex County Airport were flipped over.  Pieces of these planes were found in the woods.  Trees as high as 150 feet were uprooted.  In Sparta Township, two major roads were also closed (including County Road 517).  Other locations that reported wind damage in the county included Fredon Township,  Hopatcong,  Lafayette Township, Vernon and Wantage.   In Vernon, the damaging winds wreaked havoc at the Vernon Day celebration and scattered debris all over Vernon Crossings Fields.  This squall line caused numerous power outages throughout the northern half of New Jersey as falling trees took down electrical wires.  About 97,000 GPU customers lost power that day in the northern half of the state.  About 16,000 customers in Sussex and Morris Counties still did not have power restored to them on the morning of the 18th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The showers continuously developed off the coast, and  moved inland over central portions of Orange County, starting before daybreak on the sixth, and lasting until the early morning hours on the seventh.  Rainfall generally ranged from 4 to 8 inches  across the area, resulting in widespread flooding.  One observer in Mission Viejo reported 10 inches of rain from this event.   The hardest hit area was the coastal plain southwest of the Santa Ana Mountains.  It was the heaviest rain recorded in at least 70 years.  Collapsing hillsides, and raging water, triggered flooding that forced scores of people to flee their homes, while others climbed atop stalled automobiles to escape the rising waters.   A Local State of Emergency was declared, as mud and debris flows damaged hundreds of homes and businesses, and halted transportation.  Storm debris littered the coastline.  Some areas, like the Rhine Channel in Newport Bay, were clogged to the point where they resembled a landfill.  Total damage estimates for the county included $5.6 million to private homes and businesses, and over $12 million to public facilities, and for debris clean-up.  Some heavy rain did spill over the Santa Ana Mountains, resulting in flooding in the community of El Cerrito, in western Riverside County.  Over 4 inches of rain caused moderate to heavy damage to 8 homes and and minor damage to 10 others.  Farther north in the Victor Valley of San Bernardino County, heavy rains caused local flooding in many communities.  Heavy downpours in Adelanto shortly after midnight, flooded an apartment complex, forcing residents to evacuate, and sent a river of mud and water a foot deep running down some streets.  During the evening of the sixth, a pair of teenage lobster fisherman were caught in a storm a mile west of the beach at North Island Naval Air Station.  Swells more than 6 feet high capsized their 18-foot skiff.  They were rescued several hours later with cuts and bruises.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This second tornado injured 1 person,  damaged 17 homes, and 3  farm buildings.  One home sustained major damage, and a  pole barn was destroyed.  After nightfall the storm's forces took the form of damaging lightning,  heavy rains and additional destructive winds.  The Jefferson County fair closed early due to the storms.  Six inches of rain in 3 hours caused urban street flooding in Dane County with standing water 6 to 8 inches deep in roads around Sun Prairie. Later, heavy rain measuring 1.93 inches caused street flooding in Sheboygan (Sheboygan Co) and flooded the basement of the public High School.

It appears that a microburst hit Hinsdale and both a microburst and weak tornado affected the town of Swanzey, just south of Keene, in Cheshire County.  A horse barn was destroyed and an ice arena damaged at the Cheshire Fairgrounds.  Pieces of aluminum were wrapped around street lamps and two-by-fours were driven into the metal sides and roof of the ice arena.  One person was slightly injured by flying glass fragments when her car windows were blown in.  Many trees were uprooted or blown down.  Damage was estimated at approximately $500,000 at the Fairgrounds.  There was evidence of both straight-line wind damage and some rotation associated with this storm.In Hillsborough County,  a tornado touched down in the western portion of the town of Greenfield just to the west of Otter Lake.  It then moved to the northeast, damaging a sawmill, destroying a recycling facility, and damaging some buildings at a campground.  Wood and aluminum buildings were torn apart or blown over.  Many large trees were broken off near their bases and hundreds more had their tops broken off.  There were no injuries reported.Trees were reported blown down in Marlborough and a microburst may have occurred in nearby Dublin, where numerous trees and tree limbs were blown down along the shore of the Howe Reservoir.   All of the aforementioned damage was along a path cut by the same thunderstorm complex.  However, trees also were reported blown down in the towns of Walpole and Marlow in northern Cheshire County from a separate cluster of thunderstorms.About 1,700 electric customers in the Monadnock Region lost power during the storms.  Most of the outages occurred in the towns of Marlborough, Marlow, Richmond, Swanzey, and Winchester.  Another 100 lost power in Walpole.

The F4 tornado struck the Southridge Subdivision, near Barfield, TN, at 503 PM. The tornado caused 18 injuries and 4.7 million dollars in property  damages. One person had to be hospitalized overnight. The last time an F4 tornado struck Middle Tennessee was on May 18, 1995. The path length of the tornado was 6.5 miles with its intensity reaching F4 and its maximum width of 300 yards.44 homes were destroyed and 47 other homes were damaged in the Barfield area. There was also damage to a Middle School, Food Lion Supermarket and to the Chalet Apartments.The tornado first touched down on Yeargan Road, about 6 miles southwest of Murfreesboro,  with an intensity of F1 and path width of 100 yards. At this location, a sheet metal roof was peeled back off a barn and a couple of trees were broken off. Also close by, a trailer was lifted off its foundation and overturned. Several trees were uprooted in the area. The tornado proceeded northeast and increased to F2 intensity with a width of 300 yards. As it struck the community of Barfield, an entire roof was lifted off a house, several homes were partially destroyed, and a barn was totally destroyed. The tornado crossed the West Fork of the Stones River and struck the Southridge Subdivision. At this time the tornado increased to a maximum intensity of F4 with its width remaining at 300 yards. About half a dozen homes were totally destroyed. The tornado then struck a large apartment complex just west of U.S. Hwy 231 on the south side of Murfreesboro. The tornado produced some structural damage and extensive roof damage as it weakened to F1 intensity and its width decreased to 150 yards. The tornado then crossed U.S. Hwy 231 and the Indian Wells Golf Course. Large trees were uprooted and structural damage occurred to several businesses as it approached I-24. The tornado continued moving to the northeast across I-24 snapping and uprooting trees as it narrowed to 50 yards wide. On the southeast side of Murfreesboro near the intersection of Elam Road and U.S. Hwy 41, and near Brandyville Road and East Rutherford Boulevard, the tornado uprooted numerous trees and damaged the roofs of several homes. It was at this point the track of the tornado ended as it lifted back into the clouds. Newspaper accounts told stories of people going to a basement, or an interior room of a house such as a bathroom or closet for safety. The low casualties from this tornado indicated all the preparedness activities of the National Weather Service for many years certainly paid off.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.7M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The F4 tornado struck the Southridge Subdivision, near Barfield, TN, at 503 PM. The tornado caused 18 injuries and 4.7 million dollars in property  damages. One person had to be hospitalized overnight. The last time an F4 tornado struck Middle Tennessee was on May 18, 1995. The path length of the tornado was 6.5 miles with its intensity reaching F4 and its maximum width of 300 yards.44 homes were destroyed and 47 other homes were damaged in the Barfield area. There was also damage to a Middle School, Food Lion Supermarket and to the Chalet Apartments.The tornado first touched down on Yeargan Road, about 6 miles southwest of Murfreesboro,  with an intensity of F1 and path width of 100 yards. At this location, a sheet metal roof was peeled back off a barn and a couple of trees were broken off. Also close by, a trailer was lifted off its foundation and overturned. Several trees were uprooted in the area. The tornado proceeded northeast and increased to F2 intensity with a width of 300 yards. As it struck the community of Barfield, an entire roof was lifted off a house, several homes were partially destroyed, and a barn was totally destroyed. The tornado crossed the West Fork of the Stones River and struck the Southridge Subdivision. At this time the tornado increased to a maximum intensity of F4 with its width remaining at 300 yards. About half a dozen homes were totally destroyed. The tornado then struck a large apartment complex just west of U.S. Hwy 231 on the south side of Murfreesboro. The tornado produced some structural damage and extensive roof damage as it weakened to F1 intensity and its width decreased to 150 yards. The tornado then crossed U.S. Hwy 231 and the Indian Wells Golf Course. Large trees were uprooted and structural damage occurred to several businesses as it approached I-24. The tornado continued moving to the northeast across I-24 snapping and uprooting trees as it narrowed to 50 yards wide. On the southeast side of Murfreesboro near the intersection of Elam Road and U.S. Hwy 41, and near Brandyville Road and East Rutherford Boulevard, the tornado uprooted numerous trees and damaged the roofs of several homes. It was at this point the track of the tornado ended as it lifted back into the clouds. Newspaper accounts told stories of people going to a basement, or an interior room of a house such as a bathroom or closet for safety. The low casualties from this tornado indicated all the preparedness activities of the National Weather Service for many years certainly paid off.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.7M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In all, thirteen tornadoes were confirmed, including an F2 tornado that tracked for 6 miles through McClain County southwest of Purcell.   Some minor injuries were reported with one of the tornadoes, but no fatalities or serious injuries occurred. Reports of 3-inch hail, severe straight-line winds, and lightning damage were also received.One particularly strong supercell storm tracked across central Oklahoma, reaching its maximum strength  and producing 3 tornadoes and extensive straight-line wind damage over Grady and McClain Counties.  What follows here is an excerpt from a damage survey conducted by a National Weather Service meteorologist on May 26th, the day after the storm. "A large severe thunderstorm moved through northern and central Grady County into central and southern McClain County during the late afternoon on Sunday, 25 May 1997.  Several reports were received immediately after the storm indicating significant wind damage, especially in southern McClain County southwest of Purcell.   There also were numerous confirmed tornado sightings by storm spotters, chasers, local emergency management officials, and local residents.Findings indicate that 3 tornadoes occurred in this area.  Most of the damage, and all of the significant structural damage, resulted from the first two tornadoes. Widespread tree damage in some areas, especially in McClain County, was attributed to straight-line winds.The first tornado, rated F1, began 3 miles northeast of Tabler at 15:14 CST and tracked just south of due east for about 2.5 miles before dissipating 2.5 miles SSW of Middleberg at 15:24 CST. Structural damage was confined to a dairy farm near the beginning of the track; otherwise, this tornado remained over mostly open country.The second and more significant tornado, rated F2, began 5 miles east of Criner, or 7 miles WSW of downtown Purcell, in southern McClain County.  The beginning time of this tornado is less certain but is believed to be near or just after 16:00 CST.  This tornado also tracked just south of due east for 6 miles, ending about 4 miles NW of Wayne or 4 miles S of downtown Purcell at around 16:24 CST. Numerous power lines were downed, prompting the temporary closing of both Highways 24 and 74 for a time Sunday evening.  At least 18 dwellings, including mobile homes and permanent dwellings, were destroyed or suffered major damage.   This probably was a multiple-vortex tornado, at least in its latter stages, based on eyewitness reports. A third small tornado, rated F0, formed around 16:32 CST and  lasted about one or two minutes.  It damaged an outbuilding and a few trees 2 miles NNE of Wayne in Southern McClain County, about 4 miles east of where the second tornado ended. No one was killed or seriously injured by any of the tornadoes, but several minor injuries were reported. "The remaining 10 tornadoes were associated with other severe thunderstorms, mainly across central and southern Oklahoma.  The strongest of these occurred south of Duncan in Stephens County at 17:36 CST.  Spotter and damage reports rated this as an F1 tornado.  The remaining 9 tornadoes were all rated F0 and resulted in little or no damage.  In chronological order, these tornadoes occurred on the Caddo Comanche County line between Cyril and Fletcher (16:27CST), south of Maysville in Garvin County (17:28 CST), east of Joy in Murray County (18:07 CST), south of Stratford in Garvin County (18:13 CST), east of Roff in Pontotoc County (18:53 CST), northeast of Mill Creek in Johnston County (19:20 CST), west-northwest of Madill in Marshall County, (19:43 CST), north of Tupelo in Coal County (19:48 CST), and northwest of Newkirk in Kay County (21:10 CST). Severe straight-line winds were estimated at up to 80 mph (southwest of Fittstown in Pontotoc County). Wind damage from thunderstorm winds occurred north of Tabler in Grady County, southwest of Purcell in McClain County, in Wynnewood in Garvin County, west of Hardy in Kay County, and west of Antlers in Pushmataha County. Hail up to 3 inches in diameter fell south of Stratford in Garvin County, and lightning damage was reported south of Duncan in Stephens County. See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This description was taken almost entirely, and with minimal editing, from a damage survey conducted Monday May 26th (Memorial Day), the day after the tornado, by a National Weather Service meteorologist.This tornado, rated F2, began 5 miles east of Criner, or 7 miles west-southwest of downtown Purcell, in southern McClain County.  The beginning time of this tornado is not entirely certain but is believed to be near or just after 16:00 CST.  This tornado tracked just south of due east for 6 miles, ending about 4 miles northwest of Wayne or 4 miles south of downtown Purcell at around 16:24 CST. At its widest, the damage path was estimated to be 3/4 mile wide.  Numerous power lines were downed, prompting the temporary closing of both Highways 24 and 74 for a time during the evening.  At least 18 dwellings, including mobile homes and permanent dwellings, were destroyed or suffered major damage.   This probably was a multiple-vortex tornado, at least in its latter stages, based on eyewitness reports.  No one was killed or seriously injured by this tornado, but two minor injuries were reported. Damage began along a concentrated path from along Highway 24 around 3 miles south and 1 mile east of Woody Chapel (which is located at the intersection of Highways 39 and 24 about 3 miles south of Washington).  Details are described below, highlighting six areas along the damage track.Along Hwy 24, 5 miles east of Criner, sheet metal was scattered over about a 1/4 to 1/2 mile path, apparently the remnants of a destroyed outbuilding.  Several large trees were toppled or heavily damaged in this area.  Damage was F1.  Tree damage also was noted over a larger area 1 mile west of this location (or 3 miles south of Woody Chapel on Highway 24), along with a few pieces of sheet metal debris.  Since damage in this area was more minor (small to medium size branches broken) and notconcentrated, straight-line winds were considered the likely source.  Also along Hwy 24, from Hwy 112 southward for about a mile, power lines were downed along a 1/4 to 1/2 mile stretch of the road. Considerable debris was found from fallen trees, metal outbuildings, etc. Damage was F1.  About 1 mile east of Hwy 24 and 1 mile south of Hwy 112, a home was unroofed. Widespread but mostly minor tree damage was noted, with trees uprooted and/or branches snapped off.  Aside from the home with the damaged roof, there were few if any other manmade structures in the area.  Damage probably was F1, but an exact determination could not be made since the roof was being repaired at the time of the survey.On Emu Road, 1/2 to 1 mile south of Hwy 112 and 2 miles east of Hwy 24, one permanent home was destroyed.  Numerous large trees were downed - some snapped off, and others uprooted. Several of the uprooted trees fell toward the northwest, others to the southwest.  Damage was considered F2. At Highway 74 and Horse Road, (3.5 to 4.5 miles east of Hwy 24 and 1 mile south of Hwy 112), the worst damage and widest damage path (about 3/4 mile wide) were in this area.  Power lines were downed along Hwy 74 for nearly a mile.  Numerous large trees were snapped off or uprooted.  In one area between the two roads, nearly every tree suffered some kind of significant damage. Two mobile homes were destroyed along Horse Road. One was blown east and landed across the street near a church.  The other rolled three times and landed 50 to 100 feet northeast of its original location.  Two women, a mother and daughter, were inside the second mobile home and were lucky to escape with only minor injuries.  Metal outbuildings, satellite dishes, fences, and at least one pickup truck were destroyed - mostly by impacts from other blown objects.   However, the church, which was brick, sustained only minor structural damage to the exterior, as the roof was intact and only a few shingles were missing.  (Broken windows in the church led to more substantial damage on the interior as rain and wind entered the building.)  Damage in this area was considered F2, but the fact that the church escaped with such minor damage to its exterior suggests either a lower rating or the possibility of a multiple-vortex tornado. At least one eyewitness indicated a second tornado.  Although the entire damage track appeared consistent and more-or-less continuous, suggesting only one tornado, the eyewitness account and the observed gradients in damage intensity suggest that this probably was a multiple-vortex tornado, at least in its latter stages.From 1/4 to 1/2 mile east of Horse Road, a large home suffered major damage, with most of the second floor destroyed.  Downed trees were widespread.  Damage was rated F2.  Another home immediately east of this location lost part of its roof.  But farther east, near Interstate 35, several homes were undamaged and no significant damage could be found - except for a lone uprooted tree immediately west of the interstate.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> .9M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

There also were numerous confirmed tornado sightings by storm spotters, chasers, local emergency management officials, and local residents.Findings indicate that 3 tornadoes occurred in this area.  Most of the damage, and all of the significant structural damage, resulted from the first two tornadoes. Widespread tree damage in some areas, especially in McClain County, was attributed to straight-line winds.The first tornado, rated F1, began 3 miles northeast of Tabler at 15:14 CST and tracked just south of due east for about 2.5 miles before dissipating 2.5 miles SSW of Middleberg at 15:24 CST. Structural damage was confined to a dairy farm near the beginning of the track; otherwise, this tornado remained over mostly open country.The second and more significant tornado, rated F2, began 5 miles east of Criner, or 7 miles WSW of downtown Purcell, in southern McClain County.  The beginning time of this tornado is less certain but is believed to be near or just after 16:00 CST.  This tornado also tracked just south of due east for 6 miles, ending about 4 miles NW of Wayne or 4 miles S of downtown Purcell at around 16:24 CST. Numerous power lines were downed, prompting the temporary closing of both Highways 24 and 74 for a time Sunday evening.  At least 18 dwellings, including mobile homes and permanent dwellings, were destroyed or suffered major damage.   This probably was a multiple-vortex tornado, at least in its latter stages, based on eyewitness reports. A third small tornado, rated F0, formed around 16:32 CST and  lasted about one or two minutes.  It damaged an outbuilding and a few trees 2 miles NNE of Wayne in Southern McClain County, about 4 miles east of where the second tornado ended. No one was killed or seriously injured by any of the tornadoes, but several minor injuries were reported. "The remaining 10 tornadoes were associated with other severe thunderstorms, mainly across central and southern Oklahoma.  The strongest of these occurred south of Duncan in Stephens County at 17:36 CST.  Spotter and damage reports rated this as an F1 tornado.  The remaining 9 tornadoes were all rated F0 and resulted in little or no damage.  In chronological order, these tornadoes occurred on the Caddo Comanche County line between Cyril and Fletcher (16:27CST), south of Maysville in Garvin County (17:28 CST), east of Joy in Murray County (18:07 CST), south of Stratford in Garvin County (18:13 CST), east of Roff in Pontotoc County (18:53 CST), northeast of Mill Creek in Johnston County (19:20 CST), west-northwest of Madill in Marshall County, (19:43 CST), north of Tupelo in Coal County (19:48 CST), and northwest of Newkirk in Kay County (21:10 CST). Severe straight-line winds were estimated at up to 80 mph (southwest of Fittstown in Pontotoc County). Wind damage from thunderstorm winds occurred north of Tabler in Grady County, southwest of Purcell in McClain County, in Wynnewood in Garvin County, west of Hardy in Kay County, and west of Antlers in Pushmataha County. Hail up to 3 inches in diameter fell south of Stratford in Garvin County, and lightning damage was reported south of Duncan in Stephens County. See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This description was taken almost entirely, and with minimal editing, from a damage survey conducted Monday May 26th (Memorial Day), the day after the tornado, by a National Weather Service meteorologist.This tornado, rated F2, began 5 miles east of Criner, or 7 miles west-southwest of downtown Purcell, in southern McClain County.  The beginning time of this tornado is not entirely certain but is believed to be near or just after 16:00 CST.  This tornado tracked just south of due east for 6 miles, ending about 4 miles northwest of Wayne or 4 miles south of downtown Purcell at around 16:24 CST. At its widest, the damage path was estimated to be 3/4 mile wide.  Numerous power lines were downed, prompting the temporary closing of both Highways 24 and 74 for a time during the evening.  At least 18 dwellings, including mobile homes and permanent dwellings, were destroyed or suffered major damage.   This probably was a multiple-vortex tornado, at least in its latter stages, based on eyewitness reports.  No one was killed or seriously injured by this tornado, but two minor injuries were reported. Damage began along a concentrated path from along Highway 24 around 3 miles south and 1 mile east of Woody Chapel (which is located at the intersection of Highways 39 and 24 about 3 miles south of Washington).  Details are described below, highlighting six areas along the damage track.Along Hwy 24, 5 miles east of Criner, sheet metal was scattered over about a 1/4 to 1/2 mile path, apparently the remnants of a destroyed outbuilding.  Several large trees were toppled or heavily damaged in this area.  Damage was F1.  Tree damage also was noted over a larger area 1 mile west of this location (or 3 miles south of Woody Chapel on Highway 24), along with a few pieces of sheet metal debris.  Since damage in this area was more minor (small to medium size branches broken) and notconcentrated, straight-line winds were considered the likely source.  Also along Hwy 24, from Hwy 112 southward for about a mile, power lines were downed along a 1/4 to 1/2 mile stretch of the road. Considerable debris was found from fallen trees, metal outbuildings, etc. Damage was F1.  About 1 mile east of Hwy 24 and 1 mile south of Hwy 112, a home was unroofed. Widespread but mostly minor tree damage was noted, with trees uprooted and/or branches snapped off.  Aside from the home with the damaged roof, there were few if any other manmade structures in the area.  Damage probably was F1, but an exact determination could not be made since the roof was being repaired at the time of the survey.On Emu Road, 1/2 to 1 mile south of Hwy 112 and 2 miles east of Hwy 24, one permanent home was destroyed.  Numerous large trees were downed - some snapped off, and others uprooted. Several of the uprooted trees fell toward the northwest, others to the southwest.  Damage was considered F2. At Highway 74 and Horse Road, (3.5 to 4.5 miles east of Hwy 24 and 1 mile south of Hwy 112), the worst damage and widest damage path (about 3/4 mile wide) were in this area.  Power lines were downed along Hwy 74 for nearly a mile.  Numerous large trees were snapped off or uprooted.  In one area between the two roads, nearly every tree suffered some kind of significant damage. Two mobile homes were destroyed along Horse Road. One was blown east and landed across the street near a church.  The other rolled three times and landed 50 to 100 feet northeast of its original location.  Two women, a mother and daughter, were inside the second mobile home and were lucky to escape with only minor injuries.  Metal outbuildings, satellite dishes, fences, and at least one pickup truck were destroyed - mostly by impacts from other blown objects.   However, the church, which was brick, sustained only minor structural damage to the exterior, as the roof was intact and only a few shingles were missing.  (Broken windows in the church led to more substantial damage on the interior as rain and wind entered the building.)  Damage in this area was considered F2, but the fact that the church escaped with such minor damage to its exterior suggests either a lower rating or the possibility of a multiple-vortex tornado. At least one eyewitness indicated a second tornado.  Although the entire damage track appeared consistent and more-or-less continuous, suggesting only one tornado, the eyewitness account and the observed gradients in damage intensity suggest that this probably was a multiple-vortex tornado, at least in its latter stages.From 1/4 to 1/2 mile east of Horse Road, a large home suffered major damage, with most of the second floor destroyed.  Downed trees were widespread.  Damage was rated F2.  Another home immediately east of this location lost part of its roof.  But farther east, near Interstate 35, several homes were undamaged and no significant damage could be found - except for a lone uprooted tree immediately west of the interstate.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> .9M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado tracked northeastward and damaged or destroyed a number of homes and businesses in the area of Arch Street Pike and Dixon Road in the south part of Little Rock.  One person was killed in the same area when the building he was in seeking shelter was destroyed.  Numerous trees and power lines were also blown down.  The tornado continued to produce damage as it moved northeastward, but weakened and partially lifted as it approached the intersection of Highway 65 and Dixon Road.  At this location, a building was destroyed and the tops of some trees were removed.The tornado reemerged near the College Station area around 349 pm CST, causing widespread damage.  Many frame homes were either damaged or destroyed.  4 people were killed in the College Station area.  A number of residents noted that there was a tremendous amount of flying debris.  The tornado crossed I-440 and passed very close to Little Rock National Airport.  The airport was closed for several hours after the storm passed, due to a large amount of debris on the runways.  A hotel and a UPS Distribution Center near the airport sustained some damage.  The tornado eventually lifted soon after it crossed the Arkansas River.Much of the damage along the path of the tornado was F2 and F3.  However, some structural damage along the path was consistent with an F4 rating.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado tracked northeastward and damaged or destroyed a number of homes and businesses in the area of Arch Street Pike and Dixon Road in the south part of Little Rock.  One person was killed in the same area when the building he was in seeking shelter was destroyed.  Numerous trees and power lines were also blown down.  The tornado continued to produce damage as it moved northeastward, but weakened and partially lifted as it approached the intersection of Highway 65 and Dixon Road.  At this location, a building was destroyed and the tops of some trees were removed.The tornado reemerged near the College Station area around 349 pm CST, causing widespread damage.  Many frame homes were either damaged or destroyed.  4 people were killed in the College Station area.  A number of residents noted that there was a tremendous amount of flying debris.  The tornado crossed I-440 and passed very close to Little Rock National Airport.  The airport was closed for several hours after the storm passed, due to a large amount of debris on the runways.  A hotel and a UPS Distribution Center near the airport sustained some damage.  The tornado eventually lifted soon after it crossed the Arkansas River.Much of the damage along the path of the tornado was F2 and F3.  However, some structural damage along the path was consistent with an F4 rating.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A band of storms moved across the area bringing large hail to many counties.  Ahead of the band, however, an isolated tornadic supercell moved from Lynn County northeast across Crosby and Dickens Counties.  One of its tornadoes struck a lone, double-wide mobile home about one-half mile west of White River Lake (or about 6 miles NNE of Kalgary) in Crosby County, killing one 78 year-old male and injuring a 73 year-old female.  The couple was preparing to leave for shelter just as the tornado struck.  It totally demolished the structure and damaged a vehicle.  This same cell had caused tornadoes in southern and eastern Lynn County earlier (as reported by chasers and spotters), and proceeded to cause other tornadoes in Dickens and eastern Crosby Counties (as reported by spotters and local law enforcement).  Near Afton (Dickens Co.), a trailer was damaged, the roof of a cotton gin was ripped off, and a chimney collapsed due to a tornado.At almost the same time as the White River Lake tornado, severe winds caused damage to the Liberty Acres community just northeast of Lubbock International Airport.  Several houses were damaged (one severely) and several mobile homes were damaged (one severely), too.  The winds also knocked down four utility poles and a few trees (one of which damaged a car).  Although some people believed this storm was a tornado, a damage survey by researchers from Texas Tech's wind engineering group, as well as one by NWS officials, proved inconclusive.Minutes before the storm damaged Liberty Acres, it dropped golfball-size hail over  west parts of the City of Lubbock, damaging 3,000 to 4,000 homes as well as a few thousand vehicles.  Damages from the hail were estimated at more than $30 million.A tornado west of Plainview uprooted trees and damaged two barns.Note:  The tornado description below was added in 2005 after the report was relayed to the NWS as a result of other requests.  As the report is delayed, there is no F-rating assigned an no damage amounts have been reported.  The tornado report is included for the integrity of the database and climatological research.A tornado was reported approximately 2 miles to the northwest of Canyon Valley around 9 pm.  A residence was completely destroyed and was located 1/2 mile north of County Road 238.  The tornado is reportedly separate from the White River Lake tornado described above.  Debris from the home was scattered up to 6 miles from the residence and cedar trees where uprooted and large sandstone rocks were moved.  The debris path was reported to be an estimated 1/2 mile wide with utility poles snapped and carried four to five hundred yards south of the house.  A very heavy and anchored deer stand was blown over and damaged 1/2 mile north of the house.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These touched down, then dissipated in order.The first tornado in Williamson County formed near 2:25 pm CST and built rapidly to F2 strength.  It survived for approximately 8 minutes, often returning briefly to a roped and tilted feature before it died.  This tornado was followed by a second that formed near 2:35 pm CST.  It built quickly into a multi-vortex tornado that appeared to be near F2 strength as well.  This dissipated after only 4 minutes.  The final tornado from this same supercell, , the Jarrell Tornado, developed as a small...rope-shaped tornado, touching down around 2:40 pm CST inside the Williamson County line northwest of Jarrell.  From film and eyewitness accounts, it expanded quickly into a very large vortex nearly 1/2 mile in width. Observations recounted by eyewitnesses indicated that the damage path may not have been made strictly by one tornado.  A number of eyewitnesses reported seeing several small, rope-like funnels before the character of the tornado changed drastically into the killer tornado.   Ground damage patterns in the Double Creek Subdivision also suggested this possibility. The tornado crossed CR 308, CR 305, and then CR 307.  Where the tornado crossed each of these county roads, approximately 525 feet of asphalt was ripped off each of the roadways.  This particular destruction was believed to be very close to the centerline of the tornado circulation. As the tornado crossed the intersection of  CR 305 and 307, a business on the corner was destroyed.  The tornado moved into the Double Creek area at this point with total destruction.  F5 destruction continued from shortly after its formation until very close to the end of the damage path.The tornado began a brief turn toward the southeast as it entered the Double Creek subdivision and the surrounding area, moving very slowly.  It reached the subdivision at 3:48 pm.  This time is based on a clock found at a destroyed residence in the extreme northwest corner of the subdivision and the home believed to be the first struck by the tornado.   Here, it widened to it maximum width of three-quarters of a mile.  From the air, the ground appearance changed abruptly in the vicinity of CR 308 and continued until very near the end of the path.  No definitive circulation patterns or suction spots were evident, but there was the noted obvious change in the appearance of the ground.  In the Double Creek area, approximately 40 structures were totally destroyed.  One of the most striking signs in approaching this area was the distinct lack of debris of any size.  Closer inspection showed lots of little debris but no sign of large items.  It was estimated that several dozen vehicles had been in the subdivision and removed by the tornado.  Nearly 300 cattle grazing in a pasture near the subdivision were also killed, with many of them tossed and blown for over 1/4 mile.  At least half a dozen cars were identified from the air lying in the open areas, most of them flattened and encrusted with mud and grass.  Trees in the subdivision were completely stripped of bark.  Later ground survey revealed that most of the debris that was left in the area was extremely small indicating the power of the tornadic wind.  All 27 deaths associated with the Jarrell tornado occurred in the Double Creek area.  Eyewitnesses reported that it appeared to have slowed down as it entered the subdivision, and that may account for the nearly total destruction that took place.After passing through the Double Creek area, the tornado shifted its track again slightly, moving toward the south-southwest across CR 309 and into a heavily wooded area of cedar trees.  The total destruction of the tornado ends abruptly shortly after entering the wooded area.  However, a small swath of tree damage on the north side of the main damage path suggested the possibility of a multiple vortex pattern.  No other evidence of multiple vortices was observed.The sequence of  weather phenomenon reported with this tornado was exactly opposite of that often reported- the tornado first appeared, followed by nearly calm conditions, then hail, followed by rain and finally brief, gusty winds.  This is attributed to the fact that the parent supercell was moving toward the southwest for most of its life.  The storm essentially "backed into" the area as it moved.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It first touched down about 3.5 miles north of Cedar Park at a location 0.6 miles south of CR 178 and 1.4 miles east  of  the intersection of US 183 and CR 178.  The initial damage was to trees, however, the ground survey revealed damage nearby to a church and a trucking company.  The aerial survey did not reflect this damage as being in line with the damage path.  It is quite possible this damage was caused by strong wind near the tornado.  The beginning point was in a relatively open area with damage primarily to a few trees and minor shingle damage to one house.The tornado moved south-southwestward skirting a residential area before it crossed CR 180 immediately east of US 183.    A historic train located on the north side of CR 180 just to the east of US 183 was in the direct path of the tornado.  While the engine remained on the track, a coal tender converted to hold diesel fuel and weighing approximately 65,000 pounds including the 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel was flipped over and thrown a short distance.Continuing across CR180, it entered a shopping center where it weakened and pushed inward slightly the north wall of a grocery store.  It also pushed large metal doors inward that were built to open toward the outside.  Damage at this point had been generally F2 with brief F3 as the tornado knocked the train tender off the track and damaged the wall and doors of the food store.  It tore off much of a weakly supported roof of a grocery store.  The manager of the store, who had been a victim of the Wichita Falls Tornado of 1979, saw the approaching tornado, and made an announcement to all in the store to meet him in the middle of the store.  He then led everyone he could gather into the meat locker.  This very quick and decisive action probably saved several lives.  The tornado crossed US 183 causing additional damage to a number of businesses.  One business on the west side of US 183 lost nearly the entire roof.  Most damage to other businesses was believed to be minor.  After crossing US 183 the tornado moved across Marquis Lane and North Park Circle moving through an area with widely scattered housing and a relative abundance of trees.  Again, most damage to structures in this area was minor.From North Park Circle the tornado moved into the northwestern portion of Buttercup Creek, a subdivision of well constructed homes.  Damage to homes was irregular with one house losing a roof but the house next door losing only shingles.  Two homes in the area were nearly destroyed an one damaged when a pickup truck was lifted and tossed against its front wall.  Eleven homes were destroyed, with damage reported to over 100  homes.

It first touched down about 3.5 miles north of Cedar Park at a location 0.6 miles south of CR 178 and 1.4 miles east  of  the intersection of US 183 and CR 178.  The initial damage was to trees, however, the ground survey revealed damage nearby to a church and a trucking company.  The aerial survey did not reflect this damage as being in line with the damage path.  It is quite possible this damage was caused by strong wind near the tornado.  The beginning point was in a relatively open area with damage primarily to a few trees and minor shingle damage to one house.The tornado moved south-southwestward skirting a residential area before it crossed CR 180 immediately east of US 183.    A historic train located on the north side of CR 180 just to the east of US 183 was in the direct path of the tornado.  While the engine remained on the track, a coal tender converted to hold diesel fuel and weighing approximately 65,000 pounds including the 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel was flipped over and thrown a short distance.Continuing across CR180, it entered a shopping center where it weakened and pushed inward slightly the north wall of a grocery store.  It also pushed large metal doors inward that were built to open toward the outside.  Damage at this point had been generally F2 with brief F3 as the tornado knocked the train tender off the track and damaged the wall and doors of the food store.  It tore off much of a weakly supported roof of a grocery store.  The manager of the store, who had been a victim of the Wichita Falls Tornado of 1979, saw the approaching tornado, and made an announcement to all in the store to meet him in the middle of the store.  He then led everyone he could gather into the meat locker.  This very quick and decisive action probably saved several lives.  The tornado crossed US 183 causing additional damage to a number of businesses.  One business on the west side of US 183 lost nearly the entire roof.  Most damage to other businesses was believed to be minor.  After crossing US 183 the tornado moved across Marquis Lane and North Park Circle moving through an area with widely scattered housing and a relative abundance of trees.  Again, most damage to structures in this area was minor.From North Park Circle the tornado moved into the northwestern portion of Buttercup Creek, a subdivision of well constructed homes.  Damage to homes was irregular with one house losing a roof but the house next door losing only shingles.  Two homes in the area were nearly destroyed an one damaged when a pickup truck was lifted and tossed against its front wall.  Eleven homes were destroyed, with damage reported to over 100  homes.  The damage level ranged from F0 to F2.  At this point, the tornado track was taking a gentle right turn as the tornado track became more southwesterly.  The tornado moved into a wooded area crossing into Travis County before ending 1.1 miles from Lake Travis.  Damage in the wooded area was irregular ranging from near total destruction of all trees to sections with about 10 percent of the trees down.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 70M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

While numerous trees were twisted and uprooted in this area, several structures sustained only what appeared to be minor damage that would be no more than F0.  The tornado was initially moving westward as it moved into rough terrain.  A number of structures sustained varying damage until the tornado reached Bee Creek Road.  At that location, a Southwest Bell building housing telephone switching equipment was destroyed.  The building was well constructed and was one of several buildings which indicated at F4 rating for this tornado.  Bee Creek Road takes a bend close to the telephone building and across the street a house was destroyed with walls knocked down.Approximately 2.2 miles from the lake, the tornado path takes a distinct dog leg turn toward the southwest.  The point at which this dog-leg turn occurred also corresponds with a knoll.  Trees and buildings at the top of the knoll were destroyed.  After the dog-leg turn, the tornado assumed a heading of 250 degrees and crossed a major power distribution line.  One steel tower was destroyed bringing all lines to the ground.  The tornado remained on the 250 degree heading moving through the area described as the Hazy Hills subdivision.  Numerous houses and several mobile homes were totally destroyed.  Several houses survived but sustained major damage making them totally uninhabitable.The only death associated with this tornado occurred here when one man was killed.  He lived in a mobile home that was demolished and his vehicle was tossed several hundred feet.  Other survey team members were unable to learn whether he was in the mobile home or had left it to drive away.The tornado continued west-southwest moving across State Road (SR) 71.  A number of well built homes in the Hazy Hills subdivision were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Crossing SR 71, the tornado moved into another subdivision with widely separated houses in the Lick Creek valley, a steep walled creek that feeds into the Pedernales River.  One stone-walled house located just north of Pedernales Drive and west of SR 71 was completely deroofed.  Other structures in this subdivision sustained roof damage in the F2 range.  After following the terrain into the creek it climbed another rise in the land before ending shortly after passing the crest of the small hill.  As the tornado ended, damage was minimal to trees.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Moving into the yard, a chicken coop was completely destroyed, a barn had a tin roof badly damaged, with pieces of the tin ripped off and blown eastward about 30-40 yards against trees.

A pine tree was lifted from elsewhere and dropped into the yard along side an apple and oak tree.  A few shingles were lifted from the south side of the house and blown into the front yard and across Maple Grove Church.On the east side of Maple Grove Church Road, at the intersection of Valley Drive, a house had a few pieces of vinyl peeled from the front wall above the garage.  Twenty yards away, a mobile home was pushed from its foundation.  Fifty yards up the hill a mailbox was blown down, and the underpinnings were torn from a mobile home.  Another 30 yards west, another mobile home was rolled down a hill and destroyed.  Eyewitnesses reported that this occurred at approximately 615 pm EDT.  One person was thrown approximately 20-30 yards to the northeast, while up to five others were inside the mobile home as it bounced and rolled down the hill.  At least one injury (broken arm, cuts and bruises) was reported at this site.  A trap was ripped off of the frame, leaving it exposed however all of the installed plumbing was intact.Along this path, there were indications that the tornado lifted and touched down several times.  The tornado moved across an open field beyond the trailer where it finally lifted and moved over a wooded area.A short distance away a second tornado touched down along Georgia Highway 282.  Most of the damage from this short-lived portion was to a wooded area.  Numerous Pine trees were uprooted and snapped.  At least one home suffered structural damage from fallen trees.  Although no injuries were reported here, officials were worried about an infant who was hooked up to a heart monitor.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> .1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first touched down on the west side of Maple Grove Church Road.  A few tree tops were broken on the outskirts of a yard.  Moving into the yard, a chicken coop was completely destroyed, a barn had a tin roof badly damaged, with pieces of the tin ripped off and blown eastward about 30-40 yards against trees.  Also along this line, was a garage that was totally removed from its foundation and destroyed.  The south side of the yard had three trees that were blown down pointing west.  A pine tree was lifted from elsewhere and dropped into the yard along side an apple and oak tree.  A few shingles were lifted from the south side of the house and blown into the front yard and across Maple Grove Church.On the east side of Maple Grove Church Road, at the intersection of Valley Drive, a house had a few pieces of vinyl peeled from the front wall above the garage.  Twenty yards away, a mobile home was pushed from its foundation.  Fifty yards up the hill a mailbox was blown down, and the underpinnings were torn from a mobile home.  Another 30 yards west, another mobile home was rolled down a hill and destroyed.  Eyewitnesses reported that this occurred at approximately 615 pm EDT.  One person was thrown approximately 20-30 yards to the northeast, while up to five others were inside the mobile home as it bounced and rolled down the hill.  At least one injury (broken arm, cuts and bruises) was reported at this site.  A trap was ripped off of the frame, leaving it exposed however all of the installed plumbing was intact.Along this path, there were indications that the tornado lifted and touched down several times.  The tornado moved across an open field beyond the trailer where it finally lifted and moved over a wooded area.A short distance away a second tornado touched down along Georgia Highway 282.  Most of the damage from this short-lived portion was to a wooded area.  Numerous Pine trees were uprooted and snapped.  At least one home suffered structural damage from fallen trees.  Although no injuries were reported here, officials were worried about an infant who was hooked up to a heart monitor.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> .1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado moved northeastward into Jacksonport where there was a considerable loss of trees and damage to homes and businesses. One person was killed in a mobile home that was destroyed.  A riverboat also suffered considerable damage when it was blown into a partially flooded area on the shoreline.  As the tornado continued to move northeastward, it caused roof and structural damage to a number of buildings.  A lot of trees were also blown down as well.  The tornado crossed Highway 67 about a mile south of Tuckerman and skirted the southeast part of town.  Several miles northeast of Tuckerman, on Highway 224, the tornado caused more damage to several homes.  About 7 miles northeast of Tuckerman, there was quite a bit of tree damage.  Some tops of trees were also removed, indicating that the tornado was aloft at times.  The tornado downed more trees and power lines in the last 3 or 4 miles it was on the ground in Jackson County.  The tornado exited Jackson County 5.5 miles east of Swifton at 413 pm CST.  Damage along the path of the tornado was consistent with an F2 rating.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado was first observed by the State Police on Interstate Highway 12 west of  Covington. From data collected on a ground, damage survey by the National Weather Service, the tornado moved on a path slightly north of due east. The tornado moved across the downtown area of Covington and continued east for nearly 2 miles before lifting off the ground.  Most of the damage along path indicated F1 damage, however, several areas near downtown Covington were classified as F2 damage. Parish officials reported 43 injuries were reported with tornado, though most were relatively minor. Six persons required and overnight stay in a hospital, including three pregnant women. Most of the damage to homes was due to large pine trees which had been toppled onto houses. In downtown Covington, a few large buildings lost roofs, had windows blown out, or suffered substantial damage. A large parish building suffered $500,000 damage. Media reports indicated cleanup would cost several million dollars. Just east of the downtown area, several cars were lifted and moved tens of feet by the tornado, and an empty tractor-trailer truck rig was blown over. Nearly 50 cars in a parking lot had their windows blown out by debris or by rapid pressure drop. The same parent thunderstorm spawned another tornado just south of Talisheek damaging a barn and a house. The damage path length at Talisheek was estimated.   American Red Cross reports indicated 69 single family homes were destroyed or had major damage in St. Tammany Parish.

The tornado first touched down 1 mile west of Derry.  The tornado completely destroyed a large tier of metal stadium bleachers at a high school football field and wrapped them against a utility pole.  A nearby roof of a business was damaged and a mobile home was completely destroyed and a few mobile homes sustained damage.  The tornado then tracked through a rural area, damaging some farm buildings and downing field corn.  The tornado continued its rapid (estimated forward speed 50-60 miles per hour) northeast track and caused significant damage in a mobile home park  in Derry.  The tornado crossed Route 217 and downed trees across railroad tracks and then entered a residential area in Millwood.  One frame house in Millwood was  severely damaged and part of a room addition collapsed and trapped a resident, who was treated at the scene.  A resident of a mobile home sustained minor injuries as well. Numerous trees were uprooted and large branches and power lines were downed along the track of the storm. One home along Route 217 had a branch embedded into the house siding.  The tornado was estimated to have wind speeds of between 90 and 120 miles per hour, briefly attaining an F-2 rating on the Fujita Tornado Scale.  All tolled, 7-8 mobile homes were destroyed (3 totally decimated), 10-12 sustained major damage, 15-18 sustained minor damage. One frame house was heavily damaged and about 10 sustained minor damage.  One car was destroyed when a tree fell on it.  Parked next to the auto was another car with two occupants that were not injured.  About 10 other cars were damaged.  An open-air church in Millwood was also heavily damaged.

The tornado first touched down 1 mile west of Derry.  The tornado completely destroyed a large tier of metal stadium bleachers at a high school football field and wrapped them against a utility pole.  A nearby roof of a business was damaged and a mobile home was completely destroyed and a few mobile homes sustained damage.  The tornado then tracked through a rural area, damaging some farm buildings and downing field corn.  The tornado continued its rapid (estimated forward speed 50-60 miles per hour) northeast track and caused significant damage in a mobile home park  in Derry.  The tornado crossed Route 217 and downed trees across railroad tracks and then entered a residential area in Millwood.  One frame house in Millwood was  severely damaged and part of a room addition collapsed and trapped a resident, who was treated at the scene.  A resident of a mobile home sustained minor injuries as well. Numerous trees were uprooted and large branches and power lines were downed along the track of the storm. One home along Route 217 had a branch embedded into the house siding.  The tornado was estimated to have wind speeds of between 90 and 120 miles per hour, briefly attaining an F-2 rating on the Fujita Tornado Scale.  All tolled, 7-8 mobile homes were destroyed (3 totally decimated), 10-12 sustained major damage, 15-18 sustained minor damage. One frame house was heavily damaged and about 10 sustained minor damage.  One car was destroyed when a tree fell on it.  Parked next to the auto was another car with two occupants that were not injured.  About 10 other cars were damaged.  An open-air church in Millwood was also heavily damaged.   The tornado appeared to have dissipated as it entered the heavily wooded slopes of the Chestnut Ridge.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 800K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado moved east northeast at about 50 mph damaging several homes and downing trees and power lines. It lifted just west of Highway 1 after passing Chisholm Elementary School. The tornado then struck New Smyrna Beach High School producing Fujita Scale F1 damage. As the tornado intensified to a strong F3 category, it passed thorough the Venetian VIllas subdivision and the Diamond Head Condominiums. A number of large well built homes were destroyed.  Many of the units in the 10 story Diamond Head Condominiums received major damage as high winds blew out exterior glass walls and blew furniture into the adjoining Indian River Lagoon. The tornado then crossed the Intracoastal Waterway and passed over the barrier island between Robinson Road and East Street where a number of large well built homes were almost completely destroyed. The tornado then moved over the Atlantic Ocean. In all 32 people were injured, six requiring hospitalisation. Thirty one homes were destroyed and 290 were damaged.

The tornado moved east northeast at about 50 mph damaging several homes and downing trees and power lines. It lifted just west of Highway 1 after passing Chisholm Elementary School. The tornado then struck New Smyrna Beach High School producing Fujita Scale F1 damage. As the tornado intensified to a strong F3 category, it passed thorough the Venetian VIllas subdivision and the Diamond Head Condominiums. A number of large well built homes were destroyed.  Many of the units in the 10 story Diamond Head Condominiums received major damage as high winds blew out exterior glass walls and blew furniture into the adjoining Indian River Lagoon. The tornado then crossed the Intracoastal Waterway and passed over the barrier island between Robinson Road and East Street where a number of large well built homes were almost completely destroyed. The tornado then moved over the Atlantic Ocean. In all 32 people were injured, six requiring hospitalisation. Thirty one homes were destroyed and 290 were damaged. Damage estimates were near 14 million dollars.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 14M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado first briefly touched down along River Road  near the Barton community where trees were blown down.  The tornado touched down again near Grain Elevator Road blowing down several century old Live Oak trees.  The oak trees fell around a home which sustained only minor damage.  The tornado touched down again just west of State Road 63 where it destroyed two mobile homes and caused major damage to another.  Trees and some outbuildings were also damaged.  The tornado again briefly touched down along Barton Agricola Road where trees were blown down.   The tornado then touched down in the Howell community on the edge of George county.  Trees  were blown down along County Road 612 where a mobile home was completely destroyed and another damaged.  Six persons in the destroyed mobile home were injured.  Most of the damage from the tornado was in the F0 range with F1 damage occurring with the destruction of the mobile homes in the Barton and Howell communities.  A total of seven people were injured with two admitted to a hospital where they were later released.  The tornado then moved into Mobile county just west of Wilmer.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 90K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Five men were caught outside, trying to move their vehicles from harm's way.   Four were thrown about by the tornado and received minor injuries.  Six women in the ranch house were unhurt.  The tornado moved northeast and blew a vehicle off Highway 194.  The occupant received minor injuries.  It destroyed a stream level monitor on the other side of the highway, then ripped through a line of trees before moving into barren country.  Eyewitnesses said the tornado remained intact for most of the 35 mile track northeast to just south of Highway 96 in Kiowa county.

The tornado began about 7 miles west of Las Animas.  Eleven people were in the direct path of the tornado as it hit a ranch house and adjacent outbuildings.  Five men were caught outside, trying to move their vehicles from harm's way.   Four were thrown about by the tornado and received minor injuries.  Six women in the ranch house were unhurt.  The tornado moved northeast and blew a vehicle off Highway 194.  The occupant received minor injuries.  It destroyed a stream level monitor on the other side of the highway, then ripped through a line of trees before moving into barren country.  Eyewitnesses said the tornado remained intact for most of the 35 mile track northeast to just south of Highway 96 in Kiowa county.  Owing to the nearly uninhabited, barren landscape, little if any damage occurred beyond Highway 194 in Bent county.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This storm had a continuous track of damaging winds and hail for 33 miles.  This track could have been longer, but in this desolate area, no other reports were available.  Although there was F1 scale damage, there were no confirmed tornado sightings.  Most of the significant damage was thought to have come from Rear-flank downdrafts, due to the location to the proximity of the large hail.  The storm was moving to the ESE at 45-50 mph, so forward-flank downdrafts could have caused some of the damage as well due to the summation of outflow speed and translational speed.  Along Highway 118 the fringe-to-fringe damage path was 8 miles wide--also suggesting large-scale outflow was a contributor to the damage.An unobstructed view from the northeast allowed people in the Midland/Odessa area to see the upper half of the storm from about 200 miles away just before sunset.  The storm tower showed strong signs of rotation (in the form of large bands) even from this distance.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> North of where the RFD winds caused damage, hail up to softball size smashed car windshields and pummelled a couple of houses.  One gentleman, who was attempting to close a window, was injured when hail broke the window and caused several facial lacerations.  He was taken  by private vehicle to the Alpine Hospital.  A second man suffered minor cuts on his legs.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
