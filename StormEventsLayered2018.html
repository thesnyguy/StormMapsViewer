Another round of training storms developed the night of the 16th, fed by a moist low-level jet. Training storms and slow storm motion led to heavy rainfall across Douglas, Bayfield, Ashland and Iron counties. Three day rainfall amounts of 6-10 inches were common through these counties with a vast majority of it falling during the night of the 16th into the 17th. Areas of central Bayfield county saw in excess of 15 inches or rainfall during this event. This led to historic flooding focused in the Drummond, Grand View and Benoit areas of Bayfield County, along with the Foxboro, Chaffey and Dairyland areas of western Douglas County. The KDLH radar failed during the evening of June 16th and frequent lighting prevented the restoration of service until after daybreak on the 17th, resulting in the main radar covering this event not being available. One man was killed after his vehicle left the road and went into a ditch filled with 6-8 feet of water near the Bad River south of Ashland. Additionally, one or more microbursts were reported in central Sawyer County near Grindstone Lake resulting in tree damage and damage to homes. One man was killed when a tree fell on his camper near the town of Edgewater. The runoff from the storms continued to cause problems into the new week as it led to significant rises on area rivers and additional flooding. Damages estimates of $95,706 for Ashland County, $3,988,546 for Bayfield County, $66,180 for Burnett County, $3,875,140 for Douglas County, and $701,922 for Iron County, totaling $8,727,494.

At this point, the bowing line of storms stretched from southern Manitoba down into northeast South Dakota.

Most of the storms were sub-severe with occasional gusts of 40 to 50 mph noted on airport ASOS/AWOS sites. Other thunderstorms began to develop across south central Minnesota and moved northward toward the Twin Cities area. ||By the mid to late afternoon, temperatures rose into the 90s with CAPE values of 1500-2000 J/Kg. Due to weak wind shear, most of the storms were outflow dominant, but occasional severe wind gusts occurred with the stronger cores. Two storms produced significant wind damage near Geneva, north of Albert Lea, Minnesota, and Hutchinson, Minnesota. A turkey barn was destroyed near Geneva, and three people were injured but recovered from their injuries. Around Hutchinson, there were numerous reports of downed trees and power lines. Some of the trees caused damage to homes.  The local emergency manager in McLeod County determined that there were about 5-6 houses in Hutchinson that received structural damage from trees.||In addition, McLeod County declared a state of emergency on May 30, 2018 as a result of these high winds. An initial damage assessment was conducted and determined that there was about $54,000 in estimated public assistance damages.||Other storms produced an occasional hail stone up to quarter size. However, most of the storms were only producing dime to nickel size hail with wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A NWS storm survey indicated that a severe downburst wind, with an estimated wind of 80 mph, occurred from near the intersection of 310th Street, and 820th Avenue, |north-northeast for approximately one mile.

First was a wave of strong to severe storms during the morning hours across much of northern Iowa, followed by a subsequent wave of storms across southern Iowa. Respectively, the storms produced primarily severe hail and then severe winds and heavy rainfall.  ||Environmentally, the setup was relatively prime for organized convection and to a degree, training storms.  A relatively stationary front (slowly drifting southward later in the day) laid across Iowa from southwest to northeast throughout the day on the 28th. On the warm side of the boundary,  MUCAPE values were in excess of 2000 J/kg already early in the morning, growing to 3000-4000 J/kg by the afternoon. Other supporting factors for organized convection were present as well, including 40 to 50+ kts of effective bulk shear, hail CAPE in excess of 600 J/kg (especially in the morning round), and effective storm relative helicity around or in excess of 200 m2/s2. Understandably, composite indices such as the significant hail parameter and the supercell composite parameter returned values that raised concerns for severe weather potential. ||At the end of the day, reports were split into two distinct areas. The first was large hail over northern Iowa with the early morning convection, followed by damaging winds and heavy rainfall with the afternoon and evening convection over southern Iowa.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Law enforcement reported a semi-truck blown over by winds on Interstate 35.

This particular event featured a complex of thunderstorms that resulted in wind damage along a track nearly 400 miles long, originating in Central Tennessee and ending along the Gulf Coast. The southward movement of these storms was driven by clockwise flow around a ridge of high pressure centered over the Central United States.  In Central Alabama, the storms moved through during peak daytime heating with a very unstable air mass in place. CAPE values of 4,000-5,000 J/kg were common while bulk wind shear values were low due to the proximity of the upper ridge. Steep low-level lapse rates aided in momentum transfer of strong winds aloft to the surface. Wind damage occurred not only with the thunderstorms, but with the outflow as well.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Lineville city police reported a fatality when a large tree fell on a moving vehicle.

Initially, thunderstorms were supercells, and formed along a warm front that lifted through North Dakota in the afternoon and evening hours. One of the supercell thunderstorms produced flash flooding in Dunn and Mercer counties, while another produced 3.50 inch diameter hail over Wells County. During the evening and overnight hours a line of intense thunderstorms developed along a cold front that swept into western North Dakota, and tracked eastward across the state. Widespread wind damage occurred throughout much of western and central North Dakota, but the strongest winds centralized generally along and about 20 miles north and south of Highway 200, where episodes of microburst enhanced winds occurred. Within this corridor, many grain bins were lost, farm buildings and campers damaged or destroyed, and trees uprooted or snapped. The greatest wind damage occurred near Stanton, Mercer County, where a microburst with estimated 130 mph winds destroyed a farm. One fatality occurred at Heckers Lake in McLean County as an individual was outside a camper, and the camper tipped over onto him.

However, bottomland roads and cropland outside the floodwall were submerged. The cropland was mostly dormant this early in the season. Kentucky Highway 94 was closed in the bottomlands west of Hickman, along with several other state roads. The Dorena, MO to Hickman, KY ferry was closed due to the fast river currents and water over roads.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The heaviest rainfall held over the Redwood, and Cottonwood river basin for several hours. Several of the flash flooding parameters, including flash flood guidance, and return period for a 6 hour rainfall event, were extreme. The suggested return period for such an event in six hours was well over 200 years. ||Over 50 township and country roads were affected by the flood waters. Due to the numerous county roads and bridges that were impassable, the national guard was called in to help those who were isolated due to flood waters. ||By the time the rainfall tapered off Tuesday morning, rainfall amounts ranged from a measured high of 10.50 inches near Wabasso, to several measured amounts of 5 to 9 inches from Belview and Delhi, south and southwest to Redwood Falls, Lucan, to around Walnut Grove, and Lamberton. ||In addition to the flash flooding that inundated the area,  the heavy rains that fell on July 3 caused major flooding on rivers in southwest Minnesota. The Cottonwood River at New Ulm had its second highest crest of record, with 19.64 feet on July 6th. The record crest there is 20.86 feet set on April 8, 1965. The Redwood River at Marshall set a record crest of 17.41 feet on July 3, breaking the old record of 17.09 feet from September 25, 2010. There was extensive flooding in Redwood county with basements flooding and water closing roads. Tracy, Lamberton and Springfield were some of the hardest hit towns due to road closures and detours from flooded farmland. ||Another unfortunate cause from the flooding was an apparent drowning. An individual's car was found completely underwater in a ditch in Hector Township. The vehicle was unoccupied when it was pulled from the water. The body from the vehicle was found two days later in a ditch upstream from the location of the car. ||Governor Dayton declared an emergency for several counties hit by this storm, and storms from the previous month including; Blue Earth, Brown, Faribault, Freeborn, Martin, Mille Lacs, Nicollet, Redwood, Renville, Sibley, Stearns, Stevens, Waseca and Watonwan counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flood waters slowly receded from excessive rainfall that occurred Tuesday morning.

The sixth named storm, third hurricane, and the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Florence originated from a strong tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on August 30, 2018. Florence became a tropical depression near Cape Verde on August 31 and progressed west-northwest, becoming a Tropical Storm on September 1. Florence strengthened rapidly on September 4���5, becoming a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. Florence weakened to a tropical storm by September 7, but the system regained hurricane strength on September 9 and major hurricane status with winds of 140 mph on September 10. However, increasing wind shear caused the storm's winds to gradually weaken over the next few days. However, the storm's wind field continued to grow. By the evening of September 13, Florence had been downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. Hurricane Florence made landfall near Wrightsville Beach early on Saturday September 15, and weakened further as it slowly moved inland.||Florence produced extensive wind damage along the North Carolina coast from Cape Lookout, across Carteret, Onslow, Pender and New Hanover counties. Thousands of downed trees caused widespread power outages to nearly all of eastern North Carolina.

The bigger impact from this prolonged rainfall event came from local river and stream flooding. Several streams entered the moderate to major flooding category. The 4 day event spanning Oct 6-9 resulted in the greatest 4 day rain total in recorded Kansas City History.

An environment favorable for significant severe thunderstorms developed as a low-amplitude upper-level trough moved into the region with a deepening surface low passing across far north Alabama.  These two features resulted in a deep column of strong wind shear with 0-6km Bulk Shear values of 60-70 knots.

The tornado first touched down west of US Highway 431 north of town of Wellington, where it rapidly intensified and widened. It snapped and uprooted numerous trees along US Highway 431. Several homes were damaged by the falling trees. The tornado proceeded eastward across Websters Road and Broughton Road with scattered tree damage. As the tornado crossed Old Sulphur Springs Road, two homes were damaged with scores of trees snapped or uprooted. At Angel Station Road, the tornado filled the valley from one side to the other and caused extensive tree and home damage. An electrical transmission tower line was toppled at this point, but it was believed that flying debris compromised the structure. The tornado continued eastward and destroyed the sanctuary at West Point Baptist Church. Additional structures were severely damaged at the church. The tornado entered the City of Jacksonville where it gained strength into the EF3 category, with winds around 140 mph. It removed most of the roof and the top floor of two buildings in an apartment complex. The tornado affected the entire campus of Jacksonville State University. Several buildings sustained significant damage. The most intense winds remained north of the campus however, mowing down trees and causing direct damage to homes. As the tornado crossed Highway 21, it caused caused major damage to the Merrill Building. It then moved into a highly populated zone, where scores of homes suffered major damage and rendered uninhabitable. The tornado maintained its strength as it crossed Choccolocco Mountain, and winds funneled up the valley uprooting or snapping trees. It caused major damage to a number of homes on the mountainside. Damaged continued all the way up to just south of the peak of the mountain. As the tornado moved down the eastern side of Choccolocco Mountain, it narrowed substantially and became stronger once it reached the valley below. Stands of trees were wiped out with trunks snapped relatively close to ground level. Perhaps the most intense damage along the entire track occurred along Hollingsworth Road, where a site built home was completely destroyed with only a portion of one interior wall left standing. Debris from this home was blown downstream across a field with some evidence of wind rowing. Hay bales adjacent to the home, estimated at 800 pounds each, were thrown up to 300 yards to the east.

Most of the severe weather was along and south of a Paducah to Madisonville line. North of that line, serious flash flooding resulted in a fatality. A surface low pressure center tracked rapidly north-northeast from Arkansas to the upper Mississippi Valley, dragging a warm front north across western Kentucky. Instability was adequate for tornadoes and severe storms in the presence of very strong wind shear.

The tornado was videoed as it continued east northeast across a field north of Bill Taylor Road, where it overturned an irrigation pivot. The tornado then crossed Middle Road, flipping a mobile home on its side and atop a vehicle. Four occupants of the mobile home sustained minor injuries. Numerous trees were snapped at this location as well. The tornado reached its widest point as it continued eastward across Newlight Road, causing minor damage to two mobile homes and a shed, and damaging the roof of another house. The tornado then crossed Big Creek into Franklin Parish, and ended as it crossed US Highway 425 just north of Baskin. Here, trees were damaged and a home sustained minor damage.

Debris from this tornado also shattered the windows at Moffitt Mazda on Old Minden Road. The tornado strengthened near the Heart of Bossier Shopping Center and Benton Road where it uprooted several trees as it moved east northeast towards Pierre Bossier Mall.

These storms exhibited rotation almost immediately, and began producing tornadoes across northern Louisiana. Two tornadoes occurred in the NWS Jackson forecast area in association with a cell that tracked from near Rayville, LA north northeastward along the Boeuf River. These storms also produced strong wind as they continued into southeast Arkansas. Overnight, as the cold front associated with the storm system began to advance eastward, a quasi-linear convective system developed over the ArkLaTex and advanced eastward. These storms reached the western portion of the NWS Jackson forecast area after 2:30 am on Saturday, April 14th. Six tornadoes occurred during the early morning hours across southeast Arkansas and northeast Louisiana in association with this line of storms. The storms continued to produce damaging straight-line winds, knocking down trees and power lines in many areas, through the morning hours as it continued eastward into Mississippi.

The tornado reached its strongest intensity of EF2 strength as it neared 23rd Street. Here it snapped a couple of power poles, along with multiple hardwood and softwood trees. In addition, it tore the roof off of an apartment building and a portion of a building at Magnolia Middle School. Video evidence also indicated the tornado tore the roof off of a home near Grandview Avenue along with the loss of some exterior walls. The tornado continued to track northeast and generally followed Highway 45. Damage mainly consisted of trees being snapped or uprooted. Some of these trees fell onto homes. The tornado lifted near Willowlake Road. Maximum estimated wind speed was 115 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was only the third EF3 tornado to occur in the NWS Blacksburg forecast since 1950, and was the longest track tornado within the state of Virginia for the NWS Blacksburg forecast area. The tornado reached its peak intensity with estimated maximum winds of 150 MPH as it crossed Route 130 and entered the town of Elon.  A total of 166 homes suffered damage, and 22 of those homes were considered a total loss.  A motor home was carried about thirty feet and tipped over.  The hardest hit locations were along Nottaway Drive and Deerfield Drive.  Seven people were injured and taken to the hospital from Elon.  As the tornado continued north-northeastward out of Elon, it snapped or uprooted hundreds of trees and caused more minor roof damage to homes.  At 6:25 PM EST, the tornado finally lifted as it began to head up Shady Mountain Ridge, which is about five and a half miles west-northwest of Amherst.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It is the first time ever since storm data records began in 1950 that a tornado struck inside the city limits of Lynchburg.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the third and final segment of a tornado that touched down just south of Waterlink Road near Timberlake in Campbell County at 6:00 PM EST. The tornado crossed through the independent city of Lynchburg and eventually tracked over the James River into Amherst County at 6:08 PM EST.  This was only the third EF3 tornado to occur in the NWS Blacksburg forecast since 1950, and was the longest track tornado within the state of Virginia for the NWS Blacksburg forecast area. The tornado reached its peak intensity with estimated maximum winds of 150 MPH as it crossed Route 130 and entered the town of Elon.  A total of 166 homes suffered damage, and 22 of those homes were considered a total loss.  A motor home was carried about thirty feet and tipped over.  The hardest hit locations were along Nottaway Drive and Deerfield Drive.  Seven people were injured and taken to the hospital from Elon.  As the tornado continued north-northeastward out of Elon, it snapped or uprooted hundreds of trees and caused more minor roof damage to homes.  At 6:25 PM EST, the tornado finally lifted as it began to head up Shady Mountain Ridge, which is about five and a half miles west-northwest of Amherst.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A low pressure system situated northwest of the state slid to the northeast throughout the day, eventually moving into western and central Minnesota. Given its fairly mature frontal situation, an occluded front dropped into northwest Iowa with the warm front extending E/SE from central Iowa and the cold front dropping back to the SW. At the surface within the warm sector observations were favorable with temperatures into the mid 80s and dew points in the low to mid 70s. Looking in more detail, lifted condensation levels were quite low with values under 750 meters, MUCAPE values were modest in the 1000-3000 J/kg range, effective bulk shear was in excess of 40 kts, and effective storm relative helicity was around 200 m2/s2 to name a few. Resulting composite indices correctly highlighted an increased chance for supercells and tornadic potential as seen with supercell composite values in excess of 12 and significant tornado parameter values in the 3 to 5 range in the afternoon. All of which taking into account the general setup, understandably unable to account for storms potentially tapping into additional shear and helicity generated from rooting themselves along outflow boundaries. ||The result was a sizable tornado outbreak across Iowa, including more than a dozen confirmed tornadoes. The tornadoes of most note occurred in the NE Des Moines Metro (specifically Bondurant), Pella, and Marshalltown. The Bondurant area actually experienced two tornadoes, which were concurrently on the ground, but fortunately only one actually caused damage (EF2) within town. The Pella tornado tacked on the north side of town, directly hitting the Vermeer plant, causing EF3 damage. The Marshalltown tornado entered the town from the NW and tracked into the downtown area before exiting and weakening east of town. Widespread damage was experienced in Marshalltown including to the Lennox plant and the County Courthouse.

This made it the largest December tornado outbreak in the state of Illinois since 1957, and the third largest tornado outbreak across Illinois in any month since 1950.  Within the National Weather Service Lincoln County Warning Area (CWA), 20 tornadoes touched down...with the most significant being an EF-3 tornado that tore through the city of Taylorville in Christian County.  Despite several communities being directly impacted and experiencing major damage, there were no fatalities reported.  The severe weather was caused by a deep area of low pressure that tracked from eastern Kansas into north-central Illinois.

It hit a farmstead, destroying 3 barns and severely damaging 4 other out buildings.  The tornado was rated EF2 at this location with maximum wind speeds of 112 mph. The tornado continued moving northeastward, hitting several other outbuildings and snapping trees. The tree and outbuilding damage was classified as EF1 damage with wind speeds of 100-110mph. As the tornado continued to the northeast it snapped more large trees and then hit a log home, removing 25-50% of the roof material. It also snapped many other trees on this property and destroyed a couple of small outbuildings, throwing the debris northward into a field. The tornado was rated EF2 at this location with wind speeds of 115mph. The tornado continued northeastward and moved into a wooded area, snapping and uprooting hundreds of trees along its path. It then curved north-northeastward and moved into Hewittville, a small community on the southern edge of Taylorville. Here the tornado destroyed or severely damaged multiple houses. The first house the tornado hit lost most exterior walls and the entire roof, except for the roof over the attached garage, which was on the north side of the house. It also destroyed a second garage on the property and then completely destroyed a mobile home across the street. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds around 150mph at this location. The tornado continued north-northeastward, destroying a barn, pushing an unanchored home off its foundation and completely destroying another mobile home. This mobile home was partially anchored by wood posts set in slots on a concrete foundation over a basement and crawl space. The resident of this home was badly injured and was found unconscious, trapped under debris in the crawl space. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds of 140mph at this location. As the tornado continued, it snapped and uprooted many more trees and took down power lines and power poles. Many more homes were damaged, to a lesser extent than the first few on the south end of town, with some damage to the homes coming from trees or tree branches falling on the homes. As the tornado moved into the northern part of Hewittville, the wind speeds seemed to increase, completely destroying another home and destroying a large, old building that had been part of an old rail-yard. The tornado also damaged other homes and garages in this area. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds of 155mph at this location. As the tornado tracked north-northeastward, it moved into Taylorville, taking down more trees, power lines/poles, and damaging multiple houses. Several homes lost roofs and garages. The tornado continued through Taylorville damaging other homes and several businesses on West Spresser St. and was rated EF2 with wind speeds of 120-125mph at this point. As the tornado crossed Hwy 29 into the northern part of town, it weakened considerably, with the damage becoming less severe and more sporadic.  The tornado dissipated 1.8 miles north of Taylorville at 5:25 PM CST.  In total, the tornado impacted 506 structures...including major damage to 61 homes and 7 businesses and complete destruction of 28 homes.  Total damage was estimated at $118.9 million.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 118.90M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system spawned at least 10 tornadoes across Middle Tennessee that occurred in the darkness of night, including an EF-2 tornado that struck the Christiana area of Rutherford County, which unfortunately killed one woman and injured three others. Other tornadoes in this outbreak affected central Kentucky, northern and central Alabama, Mississippi and northern Louisiana. This tornado outbreak was the worst to affect Middle Tennessee since the December 23, 2015 tornado outbreak, which also occurred at night during the secondary severe weather season that occurs in the fall and early winter.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Christiana tornado first touched down in far northern Bedford County southwest of Kimmons Road at Longview Road, damaging an outbuilding and blowing down a few trees. This small but very intense tornado moved northeast and quickly increased in intensity to EF-2 as it approached the Bedford/Rutherford County line, severely damaging two homes on the south side of Kingdom Road/Midland Fosterville Road. The tornado then crossed the road into Rutherford County, where a small but well-built brick home had its roof blown off and brick walls blown in. One wall fell onto the homeowner causing minor injuries. Further to the northeast on Williams Road, one barn was heavily damaged and another completely destroyed. The narrow but strong EF-2 tornado continued northeast, carving a well-defined path through forests before striking a new 3000 square foot home on the west side of Midland Crescent Road. This large house, which was poorly attached to its cinder-block foundation, was lifted almost completely intact, flipped upside down, and rotated 90 degrees as it was blown to the north-northwest. One woman inside the home was killed. Numerous trees continued to be blown down further to the northeast across Jones Road. Upon reaching Rock Springs Midland Road, another home that was built in the 1800s took a direct hit from the tornado, losing its roof and all of the third story. The homeowners inside received the warning and took appropriate shelter on the lowest floor, escaping uninjured. Two silos and a barn just north of the home were de-roofed, and several nearby trees were blown down. Curving more to the east-northeast, two 70 foot-tall silos and two sheet metal barns located northwest of Rock Springs Midland Road at Gray Fox Drive were completely destroyed. Another smaller barn was destroyed and adjacent home received roof damage north of Eagle Creek Road. As the tornado crossed a northward bend in Rock Springs Road, a detached garage was completely destroyed while a home suffered minor roof damage. Further to the east, an outbuilding and mobile home were heavily damaged, with debris being blown up to 200 yards to the east. The tornado continued east-northeast, causing minor exterior damage to a home and damaging the roof of a barn. Approaching Rock Springs Midland Road, the tornado completely destroyed a small home on the south side of the roadway, with debris being blown in a cyclonic curved path 200 yards off to the east. The tornado finally weakened to EF-1 as it crossed Rock Springs Midland Road yet again, overturning an old, small mobile home on the north side of the road just west of Highway 231. Two women inside the mobile home were injured. The tornado weakened further as it continued east of Highway 231 where part of the roof of a barn was blown off and several trees were blown down. A few more trees and outbuildings were damaged along Highway 269 and Christiana Lowe Road before the tornado lifted just east of Woodfin Road. The total path length for this tornado in both Bedford and Rutherford Counties was 10.49 miles. The end point and path of this tornado was extended by 2 miles further eastward in May 2020 due to newly available high resolution satellite imagery.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.39M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The other two tornadoes struck rural areas and resulted in mainly tree damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado touched down in a field on the eastern edge of Conneautville and tracked eastward roughly parallel to Highway 198.  The tornado quickly strengthened to EF2 intensity and destroyed a duplex.  A nursing home was also damaged and lost large sections of roofing.  Residents of the nursing home were in the process of being moved to the interior of the building when the tornado struck.  Only one minor injury was reported. The tornado damaged several other homes and structures before lifting near the intersection of Carr Road and Norrisville Road. The maximum winds were estimated up to 115 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 750.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The most intense portions of the system were able to generate localized severe damaging winds and tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado touched down in Baltimore City at about 9:42 PM EDT on Friday evening, November 2, 2018. Initial damage was to a tractor trailer which was blown over on Interstate 95 just north of the Fort McHenry Tunnel. A few trees were topped just west of the interstate, and a fence line blew over on South Newkirk Street just to the east. This damage is consistent with winds of about 70 MPH.||The tornado tracked generally eastward roughly parallel to Holabird Avenue. It blew in large garage doors on both side of the building at Flexi-Van Leasing facility, consistent with wind speeds over 90 MPH.||As it continued eastward, it impacted the north building of the Amazon sorting facility, reaching a peak intensity of around 105 MPH. It blew the roof off a portion of the building, including iron rafters. With the loss of the roof, the eight inch concrete wall panels pushed in and collapsed into the building towards the north end of the west wall. Two fatalities occurred inside the building with the wall collapse. About a dozen truck trailers were pushed over, moved, or rolled by the wind. Two of the trailers were noted to have been blown in an opposite direction of the wind that toppled the wall. Several light stanchions and signs were blown over, and several car windows were blown out by flying debris. Radar data from the FAA's Terminal Doppler Weather Radar near Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport indicated this was around 9:43 PM EDT, and this is when the strongest velocity signature was noted.||The tornado continued east along the south side of Holabird Avenue, uprooting several large trees, and snapping dozens of large branches, consistent with winds of about 80 MPH.||Damage along the entire path was mainly convergent, and while much of the damage was from west-southwest to east-northeast, there were several notable exceptions of damage in differing directions.

Initial damage was to a tractor trailer which was blown over on Interstate 95 just north of the Fort McHenry Tunnel. A few trees were topped just west of the interstate, and a fence line blew over on South Newkirk Street just to the east. This damage is consistent with winds of about 70 MPH.||The tornado tracked generally eastward roughly parallel to Holabird Avenue. It blew in large garage doors on both side of the building at Flexi-Van Leasing facility, consistent with wind speeds over 90 MPH.||As it continued eastward, it impacted the north building of the Amazon sorting facility, reaching a peak intensity of around 105 MPH. It blew the roof off a portion of the building, including iron rafters. With the loss of the roof, the eight inch concrete wall panels pushed in and collapsed into the building towards the north end of the west wall. Two fatalities occurred inside the building with the wall collapse. About a dozen truck trailers were pushed over, moved, or rolled by the wind. Two of the trailers were noted to have been blown in an opposite direction of the wind that toppled the wall. Several light stanchions and signs were blown over, and several car windows were blown out by flying debris. Radar data from the FAA's Terminal Doppler Weather Radar near Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport indicated this was around 9:43 PM EDT, and this is when the strongest velocity signature was noted.||The tornado continued east along the south side of Holabird Avenue, uprooting several large trees, and snapping dozens of large branches, consistent with winds of about 80 MPH.||Damage along the entire path was mainly convergent, and while much of the damage was from west-southwest to east-northeast, there were several notable exceptions of damage in differing directions. An eyewitness fire fighter outside the Baltimore City Fire Department Engine 50 firehouse in the area saw the swirling debris and funnel cloud as it passed. The tornado lifted as it reached the intersection with Dundalk Avenue, which according to radar would have been at about 9:44 PM EDT.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the tornado tracked northeastward along Peachland Lane, it caused widespread major damage to a pecan orchard and a few large farm buildings.

The most significant damage occurred with a cluster of homes located north of Highway 84 in the Chevey Chase community, along Loop Road and at the intersection of Gregory and Grisby roads. In this area, two mobile homes sustained significant damage with one well-anchored home being shifted off of its foundation, while another well-anchored home was lifted up and then rolled over on its side. A family was inside the latter home, and one member interviewed by the survey team described a harrowing experience that resulted in another family member fracturing their arm. Other injuries were limited to minor scrapes and bruises. Other single family homes in the area had minor roof damage and significant damage to sheds. The highest rating of high-end EF-1 with an estimated maximum wind speed of 110 mph was based on the mobile home damage, and this was generally consistent with the degree of tree damage along the entire track. While the wooden power poles could technically fit EF-2 strength, their age and integrity did not impress the survey team. The maximum path width of the tornado was 900 yards in Concordia Parish along with the highest wind speeds of 110 mph.

Another round of training storms developed the night of the 16th, fed by a moist low-level jet. Training storms and slow storm motion led to heavy rainfall across Douglas, Bayfield, Ashland and Iron counties. Three day rainfall amounts of 6-10 inches were common through these counties with a vast majority of it falling during the night of the 16th into the 17th. Areas of central Bayfield county saw in excess of 15 inches or rainfall during this event. This led to historic flooding focused in the Drummond, Grand View and Benoit areas of Bayfield County, along with the Foxboro, Chaffey and Dairyland areas of western Douglas County. The KDLH radar failed during the evening of June 16th and frequent lighting prevented the restoration of service until after daybreak on the 17th, resulting in the main radar covering this event not being available. One man was killed after his vehicle left the road and went into a ditch filled with 6-8 feet of water near the Bad River south of Ashland. Additionally, one or more microbursts were reported in central Sawyer County near Grindstone Lake resulting in tree damage and damage to homes. One man was killed when a tree fell on his camper near the town of Edgewater. The runoff from the storms continued to cause problems into the new week as it led to significant rises on area rivers and additional flooding. Damages estimates of $95,706 for Ashland County, $3,988,546 for Bayfield County, $66,180 for Burnett County, $3,875,140 for Douglas County, and $701,922 for Iron County, totaling $8,727,494.

A one-year-old boy drowned when his parent drove a vehicle around a barricade and into a swollen creek on Highway 218.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It carried copious amounts of moisture as it continued to rotate while slowly moving north.  In Kentucky, the outer bands of the system brought showers and thunderstorms that produced isolated wind damage September 5 and 6.   By September 8th, Gordon was centered in southeast Missouri with much of its moisture and energy in the Ohio River Valley interacted with a stationary front. This produced efficient rainfall that caused flash flooding, and the environmental shear was strong enough to produce two tornadoes along the Ohio River in southern Indiana and north-central Kentucky.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A Yellow Cab taxi driver tried to drive through standing water underneath a railroad overpass at 13th Street and Oak Street.

The NOAA Precipitation Frequency Atlas indicated a 1000-year recurrence interval for rainfall  amounts of the magnitude which occurred during this event. The Houghton County emergency manager reported that nearly all roads were impassable in central and southern Houghton County. Many homes and businesses were flooded throughout the area, particularly in Houghton/Hancock where one fatality occurred when a basement collapsed at a home on Canal Road.  The Administration Building at Michigan Tech University also sustained flood damage. Governor Rick Snyder declared a state of disaster for Houghton County a day after the flooding occurred and damage estimates from flooding are currently over $100 million. Recovery efforts will be ongoing over Houghton County for the next several months.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

By the afternoon, it had made its way into central portions of the state, draping itself in a southwest to northeast fashion. Ahead of the front, the convective environment was ripe, with MUCAPE values in excess of 4000 J/kg and effective shear in the 30 to 40 kt range, with best values near the front.  While there was reason for concern with regards to severe weather, such has hail and damaging winds, there was also strong concern for an area of west-central, north central or central Iowa to receive heavy rainfall with the boundary placement, potential outflow boundary locations, low level jet initiation, and a very moist environment.  There was expectation for storms to be slow moving or training initially along the frontal boundary with propagation vectors opposing mean flow.||Initially storms fired up in the early afternoon across parts of northwest and north central Iowa in the very unstable environment, producing severe hail and wind damage. Fortunately, given their progressive nature, no water issues were seen with that round of convection. As the afternoon progressed, convection increased across northern areas, but remained quiet further south into central and southern Iowa. The initial northern convection pushed out an outflow boundary that made its way into the I-80 corridor, acting as another area for convective initiation. By the late evening, convection had fired up along the parent frontal boundary as well as portions of the aforementioned outflow boundary, producing marginally severe storms in most cases. By the time the low level jet kicked in, areas around Des Moines had already received a couple inches of rain, and now found the area in line for much more. Overall motion of storms was northeastward, but with nearly stationary frontal and outflow boundaries, backbuilding was induced by the low level jet, which resulted in copious amounts of heavy rainfall right on top of the Des Moines metro and surrounding areas. While some damaging wind was still ongoing, the primary concern was for heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and eventually a flash flood emergency. The Des Moines metro area took on widespread amounts of 6 or more inches, including a few reports of nearly 10 inches.  The main impacts revolved around flash flooding and the flash flood emergency with sewer systems and local streams absolutely overwhelmed. Dozens of vehicles were flooded or stranded, with numerous water rescues performed. Many streams were out of their banks, and an individual was swept away and killed during the flash flooding. One home had flooding and a gas leak that lead to an explosion of the home. Luckily all occupants had already been evacuated. Two streams with NWS stream gauge observations, Four Mile Creek and Walnut Creek, set all-time crest records.  Countless basements and businesses were flooded across the metro area and dozens of homes were completely flooded out on the southeast side where Four Mile Creek flooding was the worst. Two businesses had roof collapses from the heavy rain as well. The flash flooding and stream flooding continued into the overnight hours on July 1, so another entry is made in July 2018 for this event as well.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Emergency manager reported multiple water rescues across Ankeny, Johnston, Des Moines and Urbandale.

State of Emergencies were declared with hundreds of homes flooded and hundreds of citizens evacuated or stranded in the flood waters.  The flash flooding of streets and creeks on the west side of Madison resulted in the drowning death of one man. The already high levels of the Yahara Chain of Lakes reached record levels for the end of August into early September. This resulted in sustained flooding in sections of the isthmus in Madison and lakeshore areas of Lake Monona and Lake Waubesa. In addition to the historic flash flooding, one EF0 tornado occurred in Delavan in Walworth Co. A couple firefighters were indirectly struck by lightning and suffered minor injuries in Cross Plains. Lightning also was the cause of a house fire near Cross Plains.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The widespread flash flooding of creeks and streets in Middleton, Verona, and the west side of Madison resulted in dozens of flooded or stranded vehicles, over 50 water rescues, and hundreds of citizens stranded in place. One drowning death occurred when a man attempted to escape the flood waters by exiting his vehicle. Many city streets were closed including major thoroughfares. 70 residences in the village of Shorewood Hills suffered water damage with 15 families displaced from their homes. Basement flooding was common in Madison and suburbs to the west and south. Water rescues were also executed just west of Verona on County Highway PD due to flash flooding of the Sugar River. Some rural roads south of Madison and Verona were closed due to flooding from the Sugar River or other creeks, including portions of highway 69. Flood waters at Morey Airport in Middleton tipped over a 500 gallon tank of gasoline and a 1,000 gallon tank of jet fuel. The gas tank leaked and was contained by a containment berm.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In fact, very heavy rainfall moved north into Kimble County from Edwards County, up the South Llano River watershed area during the early morning hours of Monday, October 8.  ||About eight to 12 inches of rain fell on already saturated ground, causing major flooding over the banks of Cedar Creek and the South Llano River.  A ranging flash flood on the South Llano flooded out an RV Park located on the South Llano River in Junction, drowning four campers.  The water level at the RV Park on the South Llano River was estimated at around 21 feet.  Earlier in the morning, the South Llano River at telegraph had risen to 35 feet before the gauge failed.  The gauge reading at the Llano River near Junction measured 31.53 feet on October 8.||Additional heavy rain fell across West Central Texas and resulted in flooding and flash flooding across the area.  The following counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration for the September through October flooding:  Brown, Callahan, Edwards, Haskell, Jones, Kimble, Mason, Nolan, San Saba, Shackelord, Sutton, Taylor and Throckmorton.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Some rural residents were trapped in their homes by a major flash flood on the S. Llano River and Cedar Creek, in some cases requiring them to be rescued. Others awoke to find water in their homes and were able to evacuate themselves.||The Above and Beyond RV Resort, located adjacent to the South Llano River, was completely flooded, washing RVs and motor vehicles down stream, trapping people who sought refuge in trees in the park, and carrying some down the river. First responders who arrived at the scene before daylight, heard people, who they were unable to see in trees and on top of RVs, calling for help.  They threw life preservers to the victims in the water. ||Miraculously, a woman who was staying at the RV park was carried about 23 river miles downstream before being rescued near Yates Crossing.  She was slightly injured. At least two others were injured.  ||Old Cedar Creek flows into the South Llano River just a few hundred yards above the park. In the early hours of Monday morning, the normally small creek came expanded to 300 yards in size and poured volumes of water into the S. Llano.  This water seemed to have arrived just prior to the wall of water from the South Llano.  Rescue workers said they could hear the sound of a roar with a wall of water coming down the river. ||Authorities have reported that 40-45 people were evacuated and 19 people were rescued by helicopter or swift water rescue boats.  There were three men and one woman who drowned.  Some of these victims did all they could to help others evacuate the RV Park.||Cost of road damage was estimated at 9 million dollars.

During the daylight hours of the 7th, precipitation to the east of the NJ Turnpike/Interstate 95 turned over to snow, as colder air worked in from the north and west. ||The snow fell heavy at times away from the coast.  Snowfall amounts near the Turnpike generally ranged from 6 to 12 inches, with a sharp decrease to the southeast. Further northwest, 12 to 24 inches was observed across large parts of Somerset, Hunterdon, Morris, and Sussex Counties.||The snow contained large amounts of liquid, making it heavy and wet. This resulted in downed trees, limbs, and wires, leading to numerous power outages across portions of New Jersey, especially where the heaviest snow was reported. Many customers were still without power from the previous storm when this storm struck. Governor Murphy estimated about 350,000 customers state-wide lost power as a result of this second storm.||There were numerous reports of lightning associated with the precipitation in New Jersey, mainly southeast of the Turnpike. This included thunderstorms with heavy rainfall closer to the coast, and thunder with heavy snowfall further inland. In Ocean County, a person was struck by lightning in Manchester Township, and a lightning strike led to a house fire in Ship Bottom.||Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency which went into effect at 8 PM Tuesday March 6th.||Flights were cancelled at all the major airports due to the storm, and Amtrak cancelled at least some Wednesday service.||An accident involving ten tractor-trailers closed all four lanes of the New Jersey bound span of the Delaware Memorial Bridge for over two hours on Wednesday, March 7th.  Large amounts of snow that accumulated in a short period of time was blamed for the crash. The trucks did not actually crash into each other, rather they got stuck in the snow as they were climbing the ramp on the east-bound bridge.||Minor flooding was reported along some portions of the New Jersey coast, particularly north of Atlantic City, but there were no major problems.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A broad area of low pressure extending from the Ohio Valley to the Piedmont of South Carolina consolidated off the Virginia Capes during the early morning of March 7th.

At 1721 LST, a man was found unconscious by his neighbors on a small pontoon boat at his home on Lake Owen, on the 40000th block of Long Island Drive in Umatilla. The neighbors called the Lake County Sheriffs Office, and first responders transported the man to a local hospital where he was pronounced deceased. The medical examiners office determined the cause of death to be electrocution, and this is further supported by burn marks found on the seat and floor of the boat. NWS Melbourne meteorologists determined the lightning strike occurred around 1258 LST, this was confirmed by reports from the neighbors who heard loud bang of the strike many hours before finding the deceased man on his boat.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This made it the largest December tornado outbreak in the state of Illinois since 1957, and the third largest tornado outbreak across Illinois in any month since 1950.  Within the National Weather Service Lincoln County Warning Area (CWA), 20 tornadoes touched down...with the most significant being an EF-3 tornado that tore through the city of Taylorville in Christian County.  Despite several communities being directly impacted and experiencing major damage, there were no fatalities reported.  The severe weather was caused by a deep area of low pressure that tracked from eastern Kansas into north-central Illinois.  Warm air surging northward ahead of the low allowed temperatures to soar into the upper 50s and lower 60s, resulting in a narrow corridor of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values of 500-1000J/kg ahead of an approaching occluded front.  Thanks to ample low-level wind shear, numerous supercell thunderstorms developed within the instability axis by mid to late afternoon.  Many of the storms produced tornadoes over the next several hours before the storms gradually weakened by mid-evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A lightning strike injured a person in Huntsville in Schuyler County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Typically, thunderstorms across the lower Arizona deserts bring strong gusty winds along with heavy rain, but in this instance the stronger storms produced episodes of large hail. The cooler atmospheric conditions, with lower freezing levels, allowed the large hail to reach the ground. Numerous reports of large hail were received from trained spotters, the public and local broadcast media. The largest hailstones ranged in diameter from 1 inch to nearly 2 inches. In some instances the large hailstones produced damage; according to the public, golf ball sized hail damaged the windows of a car and a home about 2 miles from the town of Coolidge. No injuries were reported due to the large hail.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Thunderstorms with very large hail developed to the southeast of the greater Phoenix area during the afternoon hours on October 21st. Some of the stronger storms produced hail with diameters well in excess of one inch and they affected the areas around the town of Coolidge. According to a report from the public, at 1628MST golf ball sized hailstones fell about 2 miles northeast of Coolidge and they resulted in property damage to a car and house window. At the nearby Lonestar Equestrian Center, the large hail caused minor injuries to some of the horses, and gashed the head of one of the cowboys during a roping contest. The center is located near the intersection of Attaway Road and Coolidge Avenue. The diameter of the largest hailstones was 1.75 inches. At the same time, local broadcast media reported additional large hail about 4 miles northeast of Coolidge. The media relayed a public report indicating that half-dollar sized hail had fallen in Valley Farms; the diameter of the largest hailstones was 1.25 inches.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
