While warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico filtered north and encompassed the region, a series of potent upper level disturbances began lifting northeast across the Lower Mississippi River Valley. This set the stage for multiple rounds of torrential rains that fell almost continuously across the ArkLaMiss from March 8th through March 12th. These prolonged torrential rains resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding across the region, with numerous area rivers reaching moderate and major flood stages. Floodwaters damaged numerous homes, businesses, and closed many primary and secondary roads across the region, with some secondary roads washed out. ||As the storm system finally exited the region late on the 12th, another fast moving, compact storm system followed in its wake during the evening of March 13th. This system brought another round of heavy rain to the Delta region, in addition to several reports of hail and damaging straight line winds. Tornadoes were spawned by this system as well, which included one that affected Chicot County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado started on the southwest side of Dermott just west of Buckner Lane. Here several trees were snapped. As it crossed Buckner, six power poles were taken down. It then crossed Trotter Street, where more trees were snapped with others uprooted. A fence was laid down as well. A few homes here had minor roof damage where shingles were blown off. The tornado then tracked across US Highway 165 where it moved through open field. It tracked into the South Delta Regional Correctional Facility. Quite a bit of damage was done to the facility as it took a direct hit. Several large sections of the outer fence were torn down. Five buildings on the south side of the complex sustained roof damage where shingles and sheet paper were removed. The gym building, a metal structure, was heavily damaged where a large section of wall was removed. The main building of the complex suffered roof damage where roughly half of the roof was lifted or had parts removed. The roof is not a typical roof; it has several layers. Large portions of the foam insulation were pulled out along with several sections of a thin roof covering. A couple of the guard watch towers had the windows blown out and some minor damage. One employee was injured trying to exit a tower and broke a leg. The tornado then moved into a wooded area, where trees were snapped and a metal carport was thrown and destroyed. As the tornado crossed Highway 35, many more trees were damaged. One home sustained minor roof damage on the south side of the highway. The tornado crossed US Highway 65 and snapped more trees. It then continued through a large wooded area and farmland and it moved into Desha County. It then crossed Highway 159 where many more trees were snapped and uprooted. Where it crossed Highway 159, a home sustained some minor roof damage and had the wood framed shed destroyed. A few power lines were down here as well. The tornado continued northeast into a wooded area where more trees were damaged. Though the tornado likely dissipated a bit farther east, no access was available to that area due to flooding. The total path length was 9.2 miles, with 2.6 miles of that in Desha County. The maximum estimated winds were 105 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

From there, it continued on a northeastward path across a large part of Pickens County. The tornado was caught live on Camera by local media just after it crossed the intersection of Hwy 32 and County Road 1, just west of Cochrane. It continued northeast to the Cochrane Campground on the Tombigbee River, where scores of trees were snapped, causing minor damage to one of the buildings on the campground. The tornado first reached EF-2 magnitude as it crossed private wooded land just south of County Road 78 snapping and uprooting hundreds of trees. As the tornado crossed Huff-Barnett Road, it mowed down a wide swath of trees, with a distinct classic convergence pattern of tree fall just east of Beaver Creek. The tornado continued northeastward across Al Hwy 14 causing damage to the federal prison, and then moved on to the Martin Luther King Road/Sapp community northwest of Aliceville. Here, the tornado reached its highest rated damage. Many of the homes in this portion of the Sapp community received some extent of damage, and several were destroyed. From there, the weakening tornado continued northeastward roughly parallel to AL Hwy 17 over open and forested rural Pickens County until it passed just west of Carrollton. The tornado reintensified and broadened somewhat, with a more significant tree-fall causing damage to a few homes on the west side of Carrollton. The tornado continued on the same northeastward path gradually weakening over rural areas before lifting near Herbert Windle Road southwest of Reform.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado first reached EF-2 magnitude as it crossed private wooded land just south of County Road 78 snapping and uprooting hundreds of trees. As the tornado crossed Huff-Barnett Road, it mowed down a wide swath of trees, with a distinct classic convergence pattern of tree fall just east of Beaver Creek. The tornado continued northeastward across Al Hwy 14 causing damage to the federal prison, and then moved on to the Martin Luther King Road/Sapp community northwest of Aliceville. Here, the tornado reached its highest rated damage. Many of the homes in this portion of the Sapp community received some extent of damage, and several were destroyed. From there, the weakening tornado continued northeastward roughly parallel to AL Hwy 17 over open and forested rural Pickens County until it passed just west of Carrollton. The tornado reintensified and broadened somewhat, with a more significant tree-fall causing damage to a few homes on the west side of Carrollton. The tornado continued on the same northeastward path gradually weakening over rural areas before lifting near Herbert Windle Road southwest of Reform.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado then continued on a continuous path for nearly 16 miles across much of northwestern Calhoun County. Initial damage northwest of Edison, GA in northwestern Calhoun County was largely limited to downed or snapped trees. As the tornado neared Georgia Highway 216, there was an area of more concentrated damage along Magnolia Road. Two single wide mobile homes were destroyed at this location along with numerous snapped pine trees. Damage in this area was consistent with EF-1 damage or a maximum wind of around 100-105 mph. For the following four miles of the track, damage was once again limited to mostly downed or snapped trees. More significant damage occurred east of the Ichawaynochaway Creek north of Georgia Highway 37 near Dickey, GA. On Country Club Road, a single family residence was damaged, with a portion of the exterior brick wall collapsed, large sections of the roof removed, and debris blown 100-200 yards from the structure. Large trees near the residence were uprooted or snapped. Across the road, a double wide mobile home had some sections of walls and roof removed, and it was blown off its foundation by a couple feet. Additional large, healthy trees were snapped and uprooted at that location. Damage in this area was consistent with high end EF-1 to low end EF-2 damage, with a maximum wind of 110-120 mph. Even more significant damage occurred further east along the Dickey Bypass. Numerous trees in this area were snapped and uprooted. Along the south side of the road, a double-wide mobile home was completely obliterated with debris blown across the road about 50 yards or more into a tree line. This mobile home was strapped and anchored to the ground in several locations, with the anchors sticking into the ground approximately a foot. The mobile home frame separated completely and wrapped around a nearby tree. Numerous hardwood trees near the home were snapped. Damage at this location was the most intense along the track of this tornado and was consistent with strong EF-2 damage, with a maximum wind of 125 to 130 mph. Analysis of the damage patterns suggests that this mobile home may have been hit by a subvortex in the tornado, as debris was blown across the path of the tornado to the north. Most of the debris along the rest of the path tended to be blown in a more easterly direction. Just to the east of that residence, another house was damaged, with a small portion of the roof removed. The residents stated that the roof had separated from the walls, but set down again in a slightly different location. Almost all the pine trees near this house were snapped. The tree damage continued to the east for about another mile, with a medium sized shed or outbuilding also destroyed near the end of the tornado path.

On March 30th an upper level storm system moved into the region from the Southern Plains. It was accompanied by a slow moving cold front extending from a large surface low across the Central Plains into the middle Mississippi Valley.||A warm moisture rich air mass from the Gulf of Mexico moved into the region as a warm front lifted northward on the 30th. A series of potent upper level disturbances crossed the region through the 31st, bringing a rapid increase in wind aloft and resulting in an unstable environment that contained high levels of wind shear.

Two EF-1 Tornadoes occurred in Chicot County, one of which resulted in an injury.

An outbuilding was damaged at this location as well and a pontoon boat was blown several yards. The tornado continued through the center of Dermott intermittently snapping and uprooting trees and breaking a couple utility poles along the path. Minor roof damage occurred at a senior care facility, an abandoned trailer was damaged, and a fence was blown down. On the east side of down, a light pole was blown over at a baseball field and a small billboard was blown over. As the tornado crossed the intersection of AR Highway 35 and US Highway 165, several construction cones were blown away. The tornado reached its strongest point in a field north of Highway 35, where a farm equipment shed was demolished. Heavy foundation blocks and farm trailers were moved. Debris was scattered at least a half mile to the north through fields and across US Highway 165. The tornado lifted shortly thereafter.

The initial round of thunderstorms occurred early in the afternoon over northwest Kentucky. These storms, which produced a major hailstorm and flash flood in the Owensboro area, were triggered by a weak upper-level low over northern Illinois. This initial round of thunderstorms produced an outflow of cooler air that settled south into southwest Kentucky. By mid-afternoon, isolated supercells with tornadoes fired up along the leading edge of cooler air. Strong westerly upper-level winds associated with the upper-level low over Illinois provided ample wind shear for supercells. A southwest wind flow of moist and unstable air in the lower levels of the atmosphere provided fuel for the storms. Low-level winds up to around 40 knots enhanced low-level wind shear, providing a favorable environment for tornadoes. The supercells lingered well into the evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Dozens of structures were destroyed, including mobile homes, businesses, barns, and garages. Several homes received major damage or were destroyed. Many dozens of other homes and businesses received minor damage, mainly loss of shingles and fascia. Several dozen cars were damaged or destroyed. Some cars were tossed around and lofted atop other cars or structures. Thousands of trees were snapped, uprooted, or broken. The tornado was captured on video or camera by numerous individuals. The tornado appeared to have more than one vortex at several different points along its path. The tornado moved through some residential and commercial neighborhoods just outside the northern city limits of Mayfield. A car dealership on U.S. Highway 45 right near the city limit received extensive damage, including the loss of almost all 40 vehicles on the lot as well as a nearby storage building. The peak wind speed of 140 mph was assigned at this car lot. A flea market type of business on Highway 121 just outside Mayfield was destroyed by winds near 135 mph. Once the tornado reached the northern edge of Mayfield, it tracked almost parallel to the Purchase Parkway (future Interstate 69). The center of the tornado stayed about one-half mile north of the parkway, crossing Kentucky Highways 131 and 301 prior to reaching the Marshall County line. The average path width was approximately 300 yards. Peak wind speeds were estimated near 140 mph. The tornado continued into Marshall County very close to where the parkway crosses the county line.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The peak wind speed of 140 mph was assigned at this car lot. A flea market type of business on Highway 121 just outside Mayfield was destroyed by winds near 135 mph. Once the tornado reached the northern edge of Mayfield, it tracked almost parallel to the Purchase Parkway (future Interstate 69). The center of the tornado stayed about one-half mile north of the parkway, crossing Kentucky Highways 131 and 301 prior to reaching the Marshall County line. The average path width was approximately 300 yards. Peak wind speeds were estimated near 140 mph. The tornado continued into Marshall County very close to where the parkway crosses the county line.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado crossed over Interstate 10 just west of 9th Avenue. EF-1 damage was noted primarily to hardwood trees in the area of Interstate 10 and 9th Avenue. Intensification was noted as it moved further east of 9th Avenue and east of Northpointe Boulevard. The roof was blown off of two homes, one on La Borde Lane and one on Gladstone Drive. Additional EF-2 damage to homes was observed further to the northeast on Tradewinds Drive. Two vehicles were overturned in this location. It was at this point that further intensification began. The tornado reached peak intensity as it moved over the Mooring Apartments on Old Spanish Trail and the General Electric plant. EF-3 damage was observed at two of the apartment buildings with major damage to the second story. EF-3 damage occurred at the GE plant where a warehouse was destroyed. Additional EF-3 damage was noted at the Grand Baroque townhomes on Scenic Highway where two unities were destroyed. The tornado then moved into Escambia Bay and produced additional damage once it moved into Santa Rosa County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 22.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The highest impact across the Florida Panhandle was from a strong tornado that impacted the Pensacola metro. Some flooding was also experienced.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado first touched down southwest of Creighton Road and quickly strengthened as it moved northeast. The first area of EF-2 damage was noted on Lansing Drive where significant roof damage was observed to a couple of homes along with snapped power poles and extensive tree damage. The tornado crossed over Interstate 10 just west of 9th Avenue. EF-1 damage was noted primarily to hardwood trees in the area of Interstate 10 and 9th Avenue. Intensification was noted as it moved further east of 9th Avenue and east of Northpointe Boulevard. The roof was blown off of two homes, one on La Borde Lane and one on Gladstone Drive. Additional EF-2 damage to homes was observed further to the northeast on Tradewinds Drive. Two vehicles were overturned in this location. It was at this point that further intensification began. The tornado reached peak intensity as it moved over the Mooring Apartments on Old Spanish Trail and the General Electric plant. EF-3 damage was observed at two of the apartment buildings with major damage to the second story. EF-3 damage occurred at the GE plant where a warehouse was destroyed. Additional EF-3 damage was noted at the Grand Baroque townhomes on Scenic Highway where two unities were destroyed. The tornado then moved into Escambia Bay and produced additional damage once it moved into Santa Rosa County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 22.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A cluster of thunderstorms that developed near the coast intersected a lingering surface trough and tapped deeper moisture.

The tornado initially touched down in the community of Landfall near Arboretum Drive and Fair Lakes Drive. Extensive damage was done to about 30 stately trees along Fair Lakes Drive, Marshland Drive, Inverary Way and Dundee Lakes Place. A few trees up to two feet in diameter were snapped off and numerous trees were uprooted. Several large limbs were blown out of trees and caused damage to one home on Dundee Lakes Place where windows were also blown out. A vehicle weighing more than 4000 pounds with two passengers inside was traveling on Fair Lakes Drive. The tornado lifted the car from the street and deposited it at an angle on the grass a few feet away. The vehicle did sustain damage, but the occupants were not injured. The tornado crossed Howe Creek and produced significant damage to approximately two dozen large trees in the Timber Creek neighborhood. Falling limbs resulted in one injury on Tree Lake Court. The tops of several trees were snapped off and many were uprooted. Minor shingle and fascia damage was noted to one home as well. The tornado then crossed Middle Sound Loop Road and caused extensive damage to numerous trees and several homes on Wellington Drive and East Bedford Road.

The tornado initially touched down in the community of Landfall near Arboretum Drive and Fair Lakes Drive. Extensive damage was done to about 30 stately trees along Fair Lakes Drive, Marshland Drive, Inverary Way and Dundee Lakes Place. A few trees up to two feet in diameter were snapped off and numerous trees were uprooted. Several large limbs were blown out of trees and caused damage to one home on Dundee Lakes Place where windows were also blown out. A vehicle weighing more than 4000 pounds with two passengers inside was traveling on Fair Lakes Drive. The tornado lifted the car from the street and deposited it at an angle on the grass a few feet away. The vehicle did sustain damage, but the occupants were not injured. The tornado crossed Howe Creek and produced significant damage to approximately two dozen large trees in the Timber Creek neighborhood. Falling limbs resulted in one injury on Tree Lake Court. The tops of several trees were snapped off and many were uprooted. Minor shingle and fascia damage was noted to one home as well. The tornado then crossed Middle Sound Loop Road and caused extensive damage to numerous trees and several homes on Wellington Drive and East Bedford Road. Dozens of trees up to two feet in diameter were uprooted or snapped. A large snapped pine tree fell through the roof of a home on East Bedford Road. The funnel lifted for the last time near the intersection of Middle Sound Loop Road and Buckeye Drive.

Very heavy rainfall and isolated hail occurred with the main area of storms. But these storms also produced a wide area of one half to two inches of rain by sunrise. ||The morning two events set the stage for flooding in central Minnesota as several additional waves of thunderstorms developed during the afternoon, and into the evening. By Tuesday morning, a wide area of three to six inches of rain fell from north of St. Cloud to Milaca and Mora. The highest totals were across northern Kanabec County where locally six to eight inches fell based on radar estimation. The Rum, Snake and Knife rivers spilled out of their banks and caused significant and widespread flooding. ||A secondary point related to this flooding event was that according to the Minnesota State Climatology Office, this storm, which continued into the morning hours of July 12th, was the largest mega-rain event since the Duluth flood of June 19-20, 2012. A mega-rain event is classified as a six-inch rainfall that covers at least a 1000 square miles, with a central core value of at least 8 inches. ||The secondary wave in the morning, weakened by the early afternoon. An isolated thunderstorms developed near Litchfield where an outflow boundary held from the previous morning storms.  These storms moved slowly northward and produced three tornadoes along this boundary. The first tornado occurred near Litchfield, the second near Watkins, and the third north of Watkins. ||The tornado near Litchfield was rated an EF-2 with peak winds of 115 mph. It had a maximum width of 100 yards and traveled approximately 3.1 miles. The tornado caused a lot of tree damage, though three single family homes received significant roof damage, and a double wide manufactured home, and garage were flipped and rolled. Another garage and shed were destroyed near Highway 12 on the north side of town.||The tornado near Watkins was also rated an EF-2 with peak winds of 125 mph. It had a maximum width of 400 yards and traveled approximately 2.1 miles. One injury occurred with this tornado. The first significant damage was to a business along Highway 55 on the south side of town. The tornado then tracked across the highway and passed through the St. Anthony Cemetery before passing through the center of Watkins doing damage to structures and many trees. The most significant damage occurred between Stearns Ave and Meeker Ave where several homes had significant roof damage, and had detached sheds, and garages destroyed. The tornado exited the town and did further tree damage at a farmstead outside of town before lifting shortly thereafter.||The tornado north of Watkins was rated an EF-1 with peak winds of 105 mph. It had a maximum width of 250 yards and traveled approximately 4.2 miles. This tornado was spawned by the same storm that moved through Watkins. Multiple chaser videos showed the Watkins tornado lifted off the ground as it became occluded, with this tornadoes touchdown point made visible by the presence of corn laid down in the field south of the first homestead hit. This was about two-thirds of mile north- northeast of where the Watkins tornado lifted.

The storms moved across eastern Oklahoma during the evening hours. Prior to the storms moving into the area, the atmosphere ahead of the dry line in eastern Oklahoma had become very unstable. This instability, combined with very strong wind shear associated with a strong trough of low pressure that moved into the Southern Plains from the Southern Rockies, resulted in the development of supercell thunderstorms. One of these supercells produced multiple tornadoes as it tracked along and near an outflow boundary from morning thunderstorms, which had settled across southeastern Oklahoma by the afternoon.

The tornado made a turn to the east at the N4000 Road and maintained an eastward movement until dissipating before reaching the N4090 Road. The tornado destroyed at least three mobile homes. Two injuries occurred in one of the mobile homes, one of which was a critical injury. Numerous homes were damaged by this tornado, with the worst damage including major loss of the roof structure and collapse of a few exterior walls. Numerous outbuildings were also destroyed. A metal, high-voltage transmission tower/truss was destroyed, and numerous power poles were snapped. Many trees were snapped or uprooted in the path. Trees in several areas were reduced to shortened trunks with short stumps where large limbs previously existed. Based on this damage, maximum estimated wind in this segment of the tornado was 140 to 150 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Four tornadoes occurred with these storms during the afternoon, all of them in the Eckley and Wray area.  Three of the four tornadoes lasted less than 10 minutes.  The strongest and most destructive tornado developed on the northwest side of Wray and moved north-northeast.  There were no fatalities with this tornado, but there were 4 minor injuries.  Large hail also occurred with some of these storms.  The largest hail stone was 2.5 in diameter which fell near Alvin.  The strongest severe wind gust was estimated to be 65 MPH reported north of Seibert.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado developed just north of the Wray airport.  It remained semi-stationary for the first few minutes of its lifetime before moving north.  The tornado crossed Highway 385 just north of the CR 39 intersection.  As it crossed the highway it strewed barb wire fencing across the road, picked up a semi and the attached trailer, tossing them east of the highway.  Cargo from the trailer was blown across the highway.  A tractor parked near the highway was flipped on its side at this same location.  Near this same location a mobile home had the roof removed by the tornado.  Law enforcement reported around 40 electrical poles were down due to the tornado.  According to law enforcement four people impacted by the tornado had minor injuries.  The tornado's path was in the rural areas north of Wray.  The tornado ended before reaching CR 45 east of Highway 385.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 135.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It remained semi-stationary for the first few minutes of its lifetime before moving north.  The tornado crossed Highway 385 just north of the CR 39 intersection.  As it crossed the highway it strewed barb wire fencing across the road, picked up a semi and the attached trailer, tossing them east of the highway.  Cargo from the trailer was blown across the highway.  A tractor parked near the highway was flipped on its side at this same location.  Near this same location a mobile home had the roof removed by the tornado.  Law enforcement reported around 40 electrical poles were down due to the tornado.  According to law enforcement four people impacted by the tornado had minor injuries.  The tornado's path was in the rural areas north of Wray.  The tornado ended before reaching CR 45 east of Highway 385.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 135.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ���It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn���t go back.���||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged. In the worst cases, sections of road bed were washed away.  Public bridges and small private bridges were damaged or destroyed. Large debris piles collected against bridges. Countless vehicles were flooded.  Electricity and water were lost for days in the hardest hit flood areas.         ||The American Red Cross had over 800 workers helping at its peak.  They distributed over 7,500 cleanup kits and over 100,000 meals and snacks.  Many church based organizations and ordinary individual citizens volunteered their time and services to help in the flood recovery.  Nationally known celebrities and sport figures, with ties to West Virginia, also helped to raise awareness and increase donations for flood recovery.||The state transportation secretary estimated 8 million dollars in damage to roads in Clay County, 8 million dollars in Nicholas, over 13 million in Kanawha County.||Several schools were severely damaged by flood waters. This included in Clay County, White Elementary and the county bus garage. In Kanawha County, Herbert Hoover High School, Clendenin Elementary, Elk Valley Christian School, plus Bridge Elementary Schools were severely damaged.

Moderate flood damage occurred to Clay High School and Elkview Middle School.  Minor flood damage occurred at Middle Birch Elementary School in Braxton County.  Minor flood damage also was seen in Ansted Elementary in Fayette County and Glade Elementary in Webster County.||A state of emergency was declared by Governor Tomblin.  At its peak deployment, around 650 members of the West Virginia Army National Guard and West Virginia Air National Guard were activated.  Major tasks assigned to the guard troops included delivering supplies to residents with no road access, and removal of flood debris.  Private contractors were also used for debris removal.

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ���It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn���t go back.���||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged. In the worst cases, sections of road bed were washed away.  Public bridges and small private bridges were damaged or destroyed. Large debris piles collected against bridges. Countless vehicles were flooded.  Electricity and water were lost for days in the hardest hit flood areas.         ||The American Red Cross had over 800 workers helping at its peak.  They distributed over 7,500 cleanup kits and over 100,000 meals and snacks.  Many church based organizations and ordinary individual citizens volunteered their time and services to help in the flood recovery.  Nationally known celebrities and sport figures, with ties to West Virginia, also helped to raise awareness and increase donations for flood recovery.||The state transportation secretary estimated 8 million dollars in damage to roads in Clay County, 8 million dollars in Nicholas, over 13 million in Kanawha County.||Several schools were severely damaged by flood waters. This included in Clay County, White Elementary and the county bus garage. In Kanawha County, Herbert Hoover High School, Clendenin Elementary, Elk Valley Christian School, plus Bridge Elementary Schools were severely damaged.  Water from the Elk River crested about 7 feet deep in the first flood at Herbert Hoover High School. In Nicholas County. Richwood High and Middle School was severely damaged.  Moderate flood damage occurred to Clay High School and Elkview Middle School.  Minor flood damage occurred at Middle Birch Elementary School in Braxton County.  Minor flood damage also was seen in Ansted Elementary in Fayette County and Glade Elementary in Webster County.||A state of emergency was declared by Governor Tomblin.  At its peak deployment, around 650 members of the West Virginia Army National Guard and West Virginia Air National Guard were activated.  Major tasks assigned to the guard troops included delivering supplies to residents with no road access, and removal of flood debris.  Private contractors were also used for debris removal. In just Kanawha County, 15,000 tons of flood debris were collected.       ||A federal disaster was quickly declared by President Obama.

A very mild and unstable air mass was in place along with a strong southwesterly upper level jet.  These ingredients combined with a cold front and pre-frontal trough sweeping from west to east across the area sparked scattered supercell thunderstorms during the evening, a few of which were tornadic.  This was followed by a quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) that occurred with the trough, which also was responsible for severe weather.  Beneficial rainfall occurred with this system with 2-5 inches reported.  Some of the rainfall fell fast enough to produce brief flash flooding in the Florence area during the evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The assessment team was able to connect the previous Rosalie track to the Ider track after observing significant roof damage to single family home with complete destruction to a barn on the property near the intersection of CR-345 and CR-78. Additional points were added along CR-330 to CR-117 (DeKalb Co.) after the team recorded snapped softwood and hardwood trees and damage to a large anchored shed.||Significant damage was observed from the tornado along CR-117 and CR-159. Numerous hardwood and softwood trees were either uprooted or snapped at the |trunk along CR-117 leading up to CR-159. The strongest winds of this tornado were recorded near this location. A one story day care center was completely destroyed and blown off its foundation. Preliminary info recorded 10 injuries at this location. The damage assessment team noted the structure was bolted the foundation, however the floor plates connecting to the foundation were observed to have some degree of degradation. This led to a preliminary assessment of a tornado of EF-3 strength with winds approximately 145 mph. *Update: of the 10 injuries, one individual has since passed away on 2/8/17. ||Between CR-117 and AL-75 in DeKalb County, numerous chicken farms were completely destroyed along. Several homes in the area sustained significant roof damage and two anchored mobiles homes were observed to have rolled. One unanchored mobile home was completely destroyed with scattered debris. ||Finally, the team traveled along CR-792 in the Deer Head Cove area (near the AL/GA|state line) and observed complete destruction to a well anchored and large metal |shed. Winds were estimated to be 111 MPH at this location. Numerous soft wood pine trees were snapped or uprooted up to the AL/GA state line.

Additional points were added along CR-330 to CR-117 (DeKalb Co.) after the team recorded snapped softwood and hardwood trees and damage to a large anchored shed.||Significant damage was observed from the tornado along CR-117 and CR-159. Numerous hardwood and softwood trees were either uprooted or snapped at the |trunk along CR-117 leading up to CR-159. The strongest winds of this tornado were recorded near this location. A one story day care center was completely destroyed and blown off its foundation. Preliminary info recorded 10 injuries at this location. The damage assessment team noted the structure was bolted the foundation, however the floor plates connecting to the foundation were observed to have some degree of degradation. This led to a preliminary assessment of a tornado of EF-3 strength with winds approximately 145 mph. *Update: of the 10 injuries, one individual has since passed away on 2/8/17. ||Between CR-117 and AL-75 in DeKalb County, numerous chicken farms were completely destroyed along. Several homes in the area sustained significant roof damage and two anchored mobiles homes were observed to have rolled. One unanchored mobile home was completely destroyed with scattered debris. ||Finally, the team traveled along CR-792 in the Deer Head Cove area (near the AL/GA|state line) and observed complete destruction to a well anchored and large metal |shed. Winds were estimated to be 111 MPH at this location. Numerous soft wood pine trees were snapped or uprooted up to the AL/GA state line. The team traveled into|nearby Dade County, observed minor debris, but no damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A double wide mobile home was completely destroyed and an adjacent church roof was heavily damaged. The tornado passed through a grove of trees snapping nearly all of them halfway up the trunk. The strong tornado passed through a farm and caused significant damage to a two story family home. This part of the tornado path was determined to be at the high end of the EF-2 rating. As the tornado continued along a northeasterly track, two additional homes were heavily damaged before moving along an unpopulated ridge. The tornado likely skipped along this ridge as it crossed Highway 127 and then crossed Highway 111. A mobile home roof was completely removed near the corner of Shell Road and Tri Mile Road along with numerous trees that were either uprooted or snapped. The damage track seemed to end near Snow Bird Lane and Raven Cliff Road. Rear flank downdraft damage was noted farther east along Lewis Chapel Road to about Laurelwood Trail. Major roof damage was seen along Natures Trail and Lewis Chapel Road where winds were estimated around 100 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries. Three days of damage surveys were conducted to rate the tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The EF3 tornado from northeast Brooks and Cook counties progressed into Berrien County where it completely removed the second story of a wood frame home on South Coffee Road. Just up the road, a well-strapped double wide home was completely removed and tossed into nearby trees and hedges. The last of the EF3 damage occurred on Old Lois Road where most of the roof of a brick home was removed. An add-on room on the back of the home was flattened by a massive live oak tree crushing two occupants to death in their bed. The tornado continued past Old Valdosta Road stripping bark from several trees in the area and then produced EF2 damage just past U.S. Route 129 on County Road before lifting.

Ahead of this system, unseasonably warm, humid, and unstable air spread northward across much of the Ark-La-Tex from the Gulf of Mexico in advance of this system and associated Pacific cold front. A surface low pressure system also developed along the advancing cold front, with low level winds backing more southeast ahead of the upper level low. Coupled with strong wind shear and instability, scattered severe supercell thunderstorms rapidly developed during the mid and late afternoon hours across portions of extreme Eastern Texas, Southern Arkansas, and Northern Louisiana. The considerable wind shear contributed to rotating updrafts, such that twelve tornadoes touched down across the aforementioned areas. Instances of large hail was also reported with these supercells, given the very cold temperatures aloft. These severe thunderstorms exited the region during the mid evening hours into the Ark-La-Miss region where additional tornadoes and instances of severe thunderstorm damage was reported.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF-1 tornado with maximum estimated winds of 110 mph touched down along Richardson Road between the Aloha and Colfax communities and tracked northeast along Richardson Road toppling a large television antenna atop a home but just missing a large pecan orchard before later snapping/uprooting numerous trees downstream and damaging several barns and other outbuildings across a large farm. As the tornado approached Highway 71, a 3000 pound trailer was flipped over, killing a cow before landing/blocking Highway 71. The tornado continued northeast along the southeast side of Highway 471 east of Highway 71, where a single wide mobile home was flipped over and rolled about 25 yards, injuring a woman inside. A large tree also fell on a home causing major damage. Other outbuildings were damaged/destroyed as well along Highway 471. Several trees were also snapped/uprooted at the Summerfield Baptist Church cemetery before the tornado finally lifted.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries.

The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries. Three days of damage surveys were conducted to rate the tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is a continuation of the northeast Brooks county tornado.  The tornado then continued into Cook County. Still at EF-3 strength, it swept about 35 manufactured homes into a pile of rubble at the far end of the Sunshine Acres mobile home park. Seven people lost their lives. The tornado then went on to destroy about two thirds of a brick home on Val Del Road, collapsing in two walls and removing most of the second story. Another home built of concrete blocks was destroyed. A nearby farm had several concrete anchors for a large metal structure pulled from the ground.  Max winds were estimated near 140 mph.  Damage cost was estimated.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado began near the intersection of Seaboard Coastline Drive and Telfair Road. At this location, damage was mainly limited to some snapped trees and minor wind damage to the bottom skirts of some mobile office trailers. The tornado continued northward with the next damage area along Alfred Street, just east of Market Street. At this location there were some snapped trees and minor damage to the wall of one home, which was partially blown down, causing the garage door to blow out. From this point, the tornado moved northward producing sporadic, non-continuous damage. About one third of a metal roof of an industrial building just north of Market Street was damaged. Next, the tornado moved toward the more industrial and commercial area just south of Highway 80, where it did significant damage to an Advanced Auto Parts store. Three walls collapsed and the roof was heavily damaged and shifted halfway off the remaining rear wall. At this point, the tornado had its strongest winds, estimated to be around 110 mph. The rating was capped at a high end EF1 due to the lack of damage or much less significant damage to structures immediately around the store. There were also five people injured inside the Advanced Auto Parts store, and at least 5 cars were heavily damaged from the front wall of the store falling on them. The tornado continued to do very sporadic and more minor damage as it moved north of Highway 21, finally terminating at the Port of Savannah-Garden City. At the port, it pushed over some shipping containers and did minor damage to some container tanks in the area. The tornado then moved into the Savannah River and dissipated.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

During the late-afternoon and evening, storms continued to progress eastward and develop over Northwestern Wisconsin. One supercell developed a long-track tornado that traveled 83 miles from 5 miles south of Clayton, WI to 13 miles southeast of Hawkins, WI. This is likely the longest single tornado track in Wisconsin since records began being kept in 1950, as a couple events in May 1953 were very likely multiple tornadoes. There were also numerous reports of very large hail, up to 3 inches in diameter that occurred in a long swath from southwest to Amery, to near Cameron. ||Based on damage assessments through the state of Wisconsin, the total number of residential homes affected in Barron County alone was 160. Of those affected, 75 had minor damage, 45 had major damage, and 40 were destroyed. Total estimated damages were 5.1 million dollars. The total number of businesses affected in Barron County was 6. Of those, 2 had minor damage, and 4 were destroyed. Total estimated damages were 5.0 million dollars. This includes six barns at a Jennie-O turkey farm, located off of Highway SS and north of Highway OO near Chetek's Prairie Lake Estates mobile park, where some were destroyed. There were approximately 25,000 birds lost in the tornado.||In Rusk County, the total number of residential homes was 27. Of those affected, 21 had minor damage, 3 had major damage, and 1 was destroyed. Total estimated damages were $420,000 dollars.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado first developed over southeastern Polk County, then tracked mostly east-northeast across southern Barron before moving into Rusk County and eventually Price County. In Barron County, the tornado hit numerous farmsteads, devastating barns and other outbuildings.  The hardest hit area in Barron County was just north of Chetek, WI, where high-end EF2 damage was found. A number of mobile homes were completely demolished, and this is where the one fatality occurred. After that, several turkey barns were leveled, and then multiple homes were hit hard near Prairie Lake, especially those on the eastern shore.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

During the late-afternoon and evening, storms continued to progress eastward and develop over Northwestern Wisconsin. One supercell developed a long-track tornado that traveled 83 miles from 5 miles south of Clayton, WI to 13 miles southeast of Hawkins, WI. This is likely the longest single tornado track in Wisconsin since records began being kept in 1950, as a couple events in May 1953 were very likely multiple tornadoes. There were also numerous reports of very large hail, up to 3 inches in diameter that occurred in a long swath from southwest to Amery, to near Cameron. ||Based on damage assessments through the state of Wisconsin, the total number of residential homes affected in Barron County alone was 160. Of those affected, 75 had minor damage, 45 had major damage, and 40 were destroyed. Total estimated damages were 5.1 million dollars. The total number of businesses affected in Barron County was 6. Of those, 2 had minor damage, and 4 were destroyed. Total estimated damages were 5.0 million dollars. This includes six barns at a Jennie-O turkey farm, located off of Highway SS and north of Highway OO near Chetek's Prairie Lake Estates mobile park, where some were destroyed. There were approximately 25,000 birds lost in the tornado.||In Rusk County, the total number of residential homes was 27. Of those affected, 21 had minor damage, 3 had major damage, and 1 was destroyed. Total estimated damages were $420,000 dollars.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado first developed over southeastern Polk County, then tracked mostly east-northeast across southern Barron before moving into Rusk County and eventually Price County. In Barron County, the tornado hit numerous farmsteads, devastating barns and other outbuildings.  The hardest hit area in Barron County was just north of Chetek, WI, where high-end EF2 damage was found. A number of mobile homes were completely demolished, and this is where the one fatality occurred. After that, several turkey barns were leveled, and then multiple homes were hit hard near Prairie Lake, especially those on the eastern shore.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado initially touched down 3 miles west of Larned, Kansas  (See NWS Dodge City, Kansas narrative for more information on the initial touchdown), traveling northeast, near Pawnee Rock, Kansas to 3 miles west of Great Bend, Kansas to just west of Hoisington, Kansas. The tornado was on the ground for 27 miles with damage rated from EF0 to a high end EF3 (3 miles west of Great Bend, Kansas).  Two minor injuries were reported. Another minor tornado touchdown occurred in open country.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This long track tornado moved in from Pawnee County. Law Enforcement reported the tornado just south of the county line near Pawnee Rock and then followed it as it moved to the NE.  The tornado moved through the west side of Pawnee Rock causing sporadic EF1 and isolated EF2 damage to several homes and one school type facility.  The tornado continued to move to the NNE causing EF2 damage to a couple of homes on West Barton County Road.  One residence was a mobile home that lost the far east side of the structure and all roofing material.  One injury was noted at that location as they did not seek shelter.  The home just to the west lost the east half of structure with the occupants seeking refuge in the basement.  Of note, a Ford F-150 was thrown or rolled approximately 75 to hundred yards away from its original location.  Further to the NE, the tornado strengthened considerably as noted by complete destruction of an 1890 farm house.  With the age of the home and no anchoring being present due to the structure resting on cinder blocks along with a lack of debarking, a higher rating could not be justified though the amount of devastation to the structure itself pointed towards a possible higher rating.  Three occupants sought refuge in the basement and were unharmed.  The next door neighbor's home was also considerably damaged with all of the structure being demolished except for one corner section. The tornado then continued to the NE over open country damaging trees and power lines along the way before dissipating NW of Hoisington. A total of 44 parcels were affected. Ten homes were deemed total losses.  The estimated property value losses were estimated at $658,000.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 658.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado initially touched down 3 miles west of Larned, Kansas  (See NWS Dodge City, Kansas narrative for more information on the initial touchdown), traveling northeast, near Pawnee Rock, Kansas to 3 miles west of Great Bend, Kansas to just west of Hoisington, Kansas. The tornado was on the ground for 27 miles with damage rated from EF0 to a high end EF3 (3 miles west of Great Bend, Kansas).  Two minor injuries were reported. Another minor tornado touchdown occurred in open country.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This long track tornado moved in from Pawnee County. Law Enforcement reported the tornado just south of the county line near Pawnee Rock and then followed it as it moved to the NE.  The tornado moved through the west side of Pawnee Rock causing sporadic EF1 and isolated EF2 damage to several homes and one school type facility.  The tornado continued to move to the NNE causing EF2 damage to a couple of homes on West Barton County Road.  One residence was a mobile home that lost the far east side of the structure and all roofing material.  One injury was noted at that location as they did not seek shelter.  The home just to the west lost the east half of structure with the occupants seeking refuge in the basement.  Of note, a Ford F-150 was thrown or rolled approximately 75 to hundred yards away from its original location.  Further to the NE, the tornado strengthened considerably as noted by complete destruction of an 1890 farm house.  With the age of the home and no anchoring being present due to the structure resting on cinder blocks along with a lack of debarking, a higher rating could not be justified though the amount of devastation to the structure itself pointed towards a possible higher rating.  Three occupants sought refuge in the basement and were unharmed.  The next door neighbor's home was also considerably damaged with all of the structure being demolished except for one corner section. The tornado then continued to the NE over open country damaging trees and power lines along the way before dissipating NW of Hoisington. A total of 44 parcels were affected. Ten homes were deemed total losses.  The estimated property value losses were estimated at $658,000.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 658.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Damage at this location was rated high end EF1.  Farther to the northeast, more substantial tree damage occurred.  Several mature trees were topped, split and snapped at various heights above the ground.  The surrounding structures sustained corresponding roof, siding and fascia damage.  Damage was also rated high end EF1 along this portion of the track.  The tornado continued northeast and crossed Illinois Route 99 and caused additional minor tree damage.  The tornado moved northeast through the far northeast portion of town causing additional EF0 tree, roof and fascia damage to structures.  The tornado dissipated as it moved out of the northeast corner of Versailles. Overall, the tornado was rated EF1 with a path length of 0.66 miles and a maximum path width of 50 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The round of storms began during the evening hours on the 21st and ended just before midnight. During the early morning event, areas south of I-20 in Mississippi were impacted. Most notably, an EF-3 tornado tracked through Lamar and Forrest counties, killing four people in Hattiesburg and injuring over 50 others. In addition, damaging winds, large hail and flash flooding occurred in other areas across south Mississippi. The evening event impacted a larger proportion of the ArkLaMiss, and brought wind damage as well as large hail and a strong tornado.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado began along Purvis-Oloh Road, about 5 miles west northwest of Purvis. It tracked northeast across portions of Lamar County causing mainly tree damage, uprooting and snapping softwood and hardwood trees. It caused some minor to moderate structural damage as well. The tornado crossed Old Highway 11, continuing to cause mainly tree damage, although at least a few structures were also damaged. The tornado began to gain strength as it reached Slade Road, where some homes received roof damage. As the tornado crossed Sullivan Kilrain Road, additional homes received significant roof and structural damage, especially on Carter Circle and Tatum Camp Road. Comprehensive assessments from Lamar County emergency management officials count 26 homes in the county being destroyed or with major damage and 52 homes receiving minor damage. The tornado continued to gain strength as it crossed into Forrest County. There it struck a subdivision along Nellwood Drive, Lakeland Drive and Crestwood Drive and caused significant damage to many homes. Several homes received significant roof and structural damage. One home sustained significant damage and also was the site of one of the fatalities. As the tornado continued to track northeast, it caused extensive tree damage and powerline damage. It struck a church along Helveston Road, which suffered damage to the top floor. As the tornado approached William Carey College, it intensified to EF3 strength, causing damage to numerous buildings on campus. The tornado then affected a mobile home park, downing trees and causing damage to mobile homes. Here, two more fatalities occurred. It then caused structural damage to several homes, churches and businesses on James Street and Alcorn Road. Another fatality occurred on Alcorn Road, when a tree fell on a home. The tornado continued to track northeast, crossing the Leaf River and headed into Petal. Here the tornado got very wide and continued to cause EF2 type damage to businesses along Main Street and into the neighborhoods on the southern side of the city. Extensive tree damage occurred and countless homes had minor to major roof damage in the neighborhood south of Hillcrest Loop. As the tornado reached Sun Circle, it intensified to EF3 strength again and caused significant damage to a few homes as well as moderate damage to many homes in the neighborhood. Beyond the subdivision along Sun Circle, the tornado caused tree damage again before reaching Evelyn Gandy|Parkway. It caused structural damage to an AT&T store by lifting the roof of the strip mall. It caused additional roof damage to several homes and a church along the Parkway as well as along Springridge Road and Corinth Road.

The tornado tracked east-southeast approximately 9 miles southeast of Brooklet, GA to Pineora, GA. ||The tornado began near Stillson Leefield Road, in Bulloch County, GA. Most of the damage within the first few miles of the event was due to many snapped and uprooted trees. ||The most significant damage occurred near the center of the path, in an area just west of South Old River Road to near Terrell Road, in Bulloch County, GA. There were several mobile homes along this portion of the path that were either completely destroyed, or severely damaged. The extent of damage to the mobile homes was the reason for the high end EF2 rating with estimated maximum wind speeds up to 130 mph. Two mobile homes just north of Little Hagan Road were completely destroyed, being flipped and tossed 30 to 40 feet from their foundations. One of the mobile homes in this area was not occupied, but the other one had five people inside, plus pets. All five were injured, one seriously, with broken bones in their neck. Two pets in the same mobile home survived, but one died from its injuries. There was also a car pushed 20 to 30 feet and a large metal trucking container, weighing approximately 9,000 pounds, pushed about 50 feet. ||Continuing about 200 yards southeast along the path, a single family home sustained moderate damage, mainly from projectiles and debris hitting it from the mobile homes upstream. A large carport/overhang was completely torn from the home, which then |fell on and damaged 3 cars. A large hole was punched through the north wall of the home from debris hitting the window and pushing into the home. Otherwise, some minor shingle damage was observed, with 20-30% of the shingles missing.||Another 200 yards southeast of this home was another mobile home that was severely damaged. It was lifted and rolled 30 to 40 feet off of its foundation, crushing 2 cars before coming to rest on the edge of a bluff. There were 2 people severely injured in this home with one pet injured.||The tornado then continued across the Ogeechee River into Effingham County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A single, persistent supercell within the environment tracked across Candler and Bulloch Counties before producing a tornado in eastern Bulloch and western Effingham Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service storm survey team confirmed a tornado that tracked from southeastern Bulloch County to southwest Effingham County in Georgia on 02/09/2017. The tornado tracked east-southeast approximately 9 miles southeast of Brooklet, GA to Pineora, GA. ||The tornado began near Stillson Leefield Road, in Bulloch County, GA. Most of the damage within the first few miles of the event was due to many snapped and uprooted trees. ||The most significant damage occurred near the center of the path, in an area just west of South Old River Road to near Terrell Road, in Bulloch County, GA. There were several mobile homes along this portion of the path that were either completely destroyed, or severely damaged. The extent of damage to the mobile homes was the reason for the high end EF2 rating with estimated maximum wind speeds up to 130 mph. Two mobile homes just north of Little Hagan Road were completely destroyed, being flipped and tossed 30 to 40 feet from their foundations. One of the mobile homes in this area was not occupied, but the other one had five people inside, plus pets. All five were injured, one seriously, with broken bones in their neck. Two pets in the same mobile home survived, but one died from its injuries. There was also a car pushed 20 to 30 feet and a large metal trucking container, weighing approximately 9,000 pounds, pushed about 50 feet. ||Continuing about 200 yards southeast along the path, a single family home sustained moderate damage, mainly from projectiles and debris hitting it from the mobile homes upstream. A large carport/overhang was completely torn from the home, which then |fell on and damaged 3 cars. A large hole was punched through the north wall of the home from debris hitting the window and pushing into the home. Otherwise, some minor shingle damage was observed, with 20-30% of the shingles missing.||Another 200 yards southeast of this home was another mobile home that was severely damaged. It was lifted and rolled 30 to 40 feet off of its foundation, crushing 2 cars before coming to rest on the edge of a bluff. There were 2 people severely injured in this home with one pet injured.||The tornado then continued across the Ogeechee River into Effingham County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado quickly became violent, reaching EF-4 intensity and leveling five homes just west of Interstate 55, about 3.5 miles northwest of Perryville. Numerous unoccupied cars from a salvage yard were blown into or over Interstate 55. The lone fatality occurred when a southbound vehicle on Interstate 55 was intercepted by the tornado.

The passenger in the vehicle was treated for minor injuries at a local hospital. The area of greatest home and property destruction was three miles north of Perryville, in the vicinity of U.S. Highway 61. Maximum wind speeds were estimated near 180 mph in the vicinity of Interstate 55 and also near U.S. Highway 61. The damage path showed multiple vortex characteristics with ground striations and scarring to bare ground. At least 100 homes were damaged or destroyed in Perry County, mostly on the northern outskirts of Perryville. Most persons in the tornado's path took shelter in their basements. All twelve tornado injuries occurred in Perry County, where the tornado was at its strongest. At least one couple was trapped in their basement until rescuers removed debris. As the tornado approached the Mississippi River, multiple ground striations were noted in a farm field, indicative of multiple vortices. The maximum path width was over one-half mile shortly before the tornado crossed the Mississippi River into Randolph County, Illinois.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms developed over northwestern Oklahoma and south central Kansas during the evening hours and moved east into northeastern Oklahoma during the late evening hours of the 5th and early morning hours of the 6th. The thunderstorms evolved into a nearly solid line by the time they reached northeastern Oklahoma and resulted in widespread damaging wind. Very strong low-level wind shear ahead of the line allowed for the development of several areas of rotation along and within the leading edge of the thunderstorms. Several tornadoes formed from these low-level circulations, including a strong tornado that resulted in severe damage across portions of the City of Tulsa.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado developed over a neighborhood east of S Harvard Avenue and south of E 36th Street S, where large tree limbs were snapped and homes were damaged. The tornado moved east-southeast crossing S Yale Avenue where numerous trees and power poles were snapped. Numerous businesses were damaged or destroyed between S Yale Avenue and S Sheridan Road along and within a few blocks of E 41st Street S. Some of the worst damage in the path was in this area. Some of the businesses in the area had the roofs blown off the structure and some had exterior walls blown down. Several vehicles were rolled in this area, and reportedly 30 people were injured there. Numerous other businesses sustained mainly roof, wall, and window damage between S Sheridan Road and Highway 169. Many power poles and trees were also blown down in this area. The tornado turned more easterly near Highway 169 and moved roughly along E 51st Street S, dissipating just before reaching N Aspen Avenue (S 145th East Avenue). Based on this damage, maximum estimated wind in the tornado was 120 to 130 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms developed over northwestern Oklahoma and south central Kansas during the evening hours and moved east into northeastern Oklahoma during the late evening hours of the 5th and early morning hours of the 6th. The thunderstorms evolved into a nearly solid line by the time they reached northeastern Oklahoma and resulted in widespread damaging wind. Very strong low-level wind shear ahead of the line allowed for the development of several areas of rotation along and within the leading edge of the thunderstorms. Several tornadoes formed from these low-level circulations, including a strong tornado that resulted in severe damage across portions of the City of Tulsa.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado developed over a neighborhood east of S Harvard Avenue and south of E 36th Street S, where large tree limbs were snapped and homes were damaged. The tornado moved east-southeast crossing S Yale Avenue where numerous trees and power poles were snapped. Numerous businesses were damaged or destroyed between S Yale Avenue and S Sheridan Road along and within a few blocks of E 41st Street S. Some of the worst damage in the path was in this area. Some of the businesses in the area had the roofs blown off the structure and some had exterior walls blown down. Several vehicles were rolled in this area, and reportedly 30 people were injured there. Numerous other businesses sustained mainly roof, wall, and window damage between S Sheridan Road and Highway 169. Many power poles and trees were also blown down in this area. The tornado turned more easterly near Highway 169 and moved roughly along E 51st Street S, dissipating just before reaching N Aspen Avenue (S 145th East Avenue). Based on this damage, maximum estimated wind in the tornado was 120 to 130 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The parent supercell cycled another tornado about a mile to the east and northeast of the previous storm. This tornado quickly grew to a large tornado, becoming slightly less than one mile wide at its widest point. The tornado was at the strongest near Interstate 20 and FM 17 just north of Canton. The survey crews found continuous damage between Canton and Fruitvale, and then additional damage as far north as Emory, |and Lake Fork. Several homes, businesses, and farm buildings were damaged or destroyed in the 40 mile continuous damage path. This tornado occurred for over an hour, and spanned most of Van Zandt, and nearly all of Rains Counties during the 80 minute track.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 600.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Impressively strong atmospheric conditions led to very strong gradient winds ahead of the cold front. Later in the day a line of strong to severe storms pushed into central Kentucky. There were several reports of damaging winds along with 3 brief tornadoes which led to a few minor injuries.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This small tornado was embedded in a fast moving squall line that raced east at 55 mph.  The twister first touched down at a home on U.S. Highway 62 just west of Goshen Church Road, tearing off shingles and uprooting a tree.

The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries. Three days of damage surveys were conducted to rate the tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado was the first of two produced by the same thunderstorm that moved across South Georgia early Sunday morning. The tornado initially touched down just west of US-19 in Thomas County and then moved NE across mainly rural areas of the county. Damage was initially limited in the vicinity of US-19 to snapped and uprooted pine trees. The tornado began to strengthen and produced more significant damage near the vicinity of Crowley and Hall Roads where a home lost a significant amount of roof deck and numerous large trees were snapped and uprooted. Damage in this area was consistent with higher end EF-1 to lower end EF-2 intensity. As the tornado neared US-319 north of Thomasville, extensive areas of snapped pine trees were found along the damage path in some areas several hundred yards wide. Also in the vicinity was a mobile home that was completely destroyed. Damage in this area was consistent with lower end EF-2 intensity. The tornado continued across mainly rural NE Thomas County crossing Centennial Road where a double-wide mobile home was completely destroyed. Damage in this area was consistent with a EF-2 tornado. After this point, damage was mainly limited to significant tree damage along the path,  though some structural damage occurred to the NW of Pavo before the tornado crossed into NW Brooks County. Damage along this section of the tornado was rated EF-1.  Max winds for the tornado were estimated near 120 mph. Damage cost was estimated.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries. Three days of damage surveys were conducted to rate the tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado was the first of two produced by the same thunderstorm that moved across South Georgia early Sunday morning. The tornado initially touched down just west of US-19 in Thomas County and then moved NE across mainly rural areas of the county. Damage was initially limited in the vicinity of US-19 to snapped and uprooted pine trees. The tornado began to strengthen and produced more significant damage near the vicinity of Crowley and Hall Roads where a home lost a significant amount of roof deck and numerous large trees were snapped and uprooted. Damage in this area was consistent with higher end EF-1 to lower end EF-2 intensity. As the tornado neared US-319 north of Thomasville, extensive areas of snapped pine trees were found along the damage path in some areas several hundred yards wide. Also in the vicinity was a mobile home that was completely destroyed. Damage in this area was consistent with lower end EF-2 intensity. The tornado continued across mainly rural NE Thomas County crossing Centennial Road where a double-wide mobile home was completely destroyed. Damage in this area was consistent with a EF-2 tornado. After this point, damage was mainly limited to significant tree damage along the path,  though some structural damage occurred to the NW of Pavo before the tornado crossed into NW Brooks County. Damage along this section of the tornado was rated EF-1.  Max winds for the tornado were estimated near 120 mph. Damage cost was estimated.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado lifted just east of Abbeville. The tornado caused significant damage along the track, resulting in 5 fatalities in Albany. Severe tree damage was observed along the entire path which was up to 1.2 miles wide. In many spots, 90 to 100 percent of the trees in the path were uprooted or snapped. In Dougherty County, the tornado touched down on Tarva Road. By the time it reached Newton, the tornado was approximately 1.25 miles wide. There was extensive tree damage and some minor to moderate damage to a few homes in this area, consistent with EF2 damage. The tornado moved through the Radium Springs area, destroying nearly every tree in its path and causing EF2 damage to several houses. Most houses in this area had significant damage from falling trees. The tornado then moved through several mobile home parks just west of U.S. 319, destroying many mobile homes and causing the 4 fatalities. Damage consistent with an EF3 tornado was observed just east of U.S. 319. The tornado caused a large portion of a warehouse at the Proctor and Gamble Plant to collapse and tossed several semi-trailers across Mock Road. Additional EF3 damage was observed at the Marine Corp Logistics Base, where multiple anchored double-wide trailers were completely destroyed. In addition, several concrete light poles were snapped near the base, and a large solid concrete building had its solid concrete roof shifted more than 2 inches. A well-built concrete block church on Sylvester Rd was demolished with only parts of a few walls remaining. The estimated wind speed at this point is 150 mph, the highest analyzed along the track. EF3 damage was also observed on Harris Road where a cement block church was destroyed.

The first round of severe weather started during the mid-morning hours on Saturday, January 21, 2017 as a squall line pushed into southeast Alabama and the Florida panhandle. As it pushed eastward nine warnings were issued with a total of 18 damaging wind reports (trees and power lines downed) related to these storms. ||After a brief lull during Saturday evening as the aforementioned squall line washed out near the Gulf Coast, strong southerly flow returned late Saturday night as a warm front pushed northward across the Florida Big Bend and southern Georgia. Initially with this late Saturday night to early Sunday morning event, a strong supercell moved across southern Georgia producing a tornado that moved across Thomas and northern Brooks Counties. This was the first tornado across the area with this multi- day event. From the same supercell that produced the tornado in Thomas and northern Brooks Counties, another tornado developed that tracked across Brooks, Berrien and Cook Counties and this tornado resulted in 11 fatalities. This overnight into early Sunday morning event produced one more tornado, an EF-1 that struck Lowndes County. ||A final round of severe weather moved through Sunday afternoon as a warm front continued to push northward into southeast Alabama and southern Georgia while the main low and trailing cold front pushed eastward across the Florida panhandle and offshore regions. This afternoon round of supercells first produced a tornado in Henry County, AL. An hour and a half after the Henry County tornado, two more tornadoes developed, an EF-2 that struck Clay, Randolph and Calhoun Counties (Georgia) and an EF-1 tornado that hit Franklin County, FL. After this, a long tracked tornado (track length of more than 70 miles) moved across Albany (Dougherty County) and into Worth and Turner Counties, causing extensive damage and five fatalities. ||Overall this multi-day event resulted in seven tornadoes, 16 deaths and numerous injuries. Three days of damage surveys were conducted to rate the tornadoes on the Enhanced Fujita scale.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The EF3 tornado from Dougherty county continued all the way across Worth county into Turner county as an EF3 tornado with max winds estimated near 150 mph.  In Worth County, it caused extensive damage to homes along Jewel Crowe Road. This was consistent with EF3 damage. Damage to homes and outbuildings consistent with EF2 damage was observed along Camp Osborn Road. A concrete block church on Zion Church Road was completely destroyed, justifying an EF3 rating at that point.

A cold front was moving southeast across the state and entered our northwestern|counties around sunrise. The strength of the cap was sufficient to hamper any development until mid afternoon. Deep forcing for ascent approached from from the west while remnant boundaries associated with convection over far East Texas and West Louisiana moved in from the east. By 3:30 PM, several parameters came together for the rapid development of severe storms east of Interstate 35/35E. Pre-frontal convection led to the development of supercells, producing numerous tornadoes over a relatively small area. Additional storm development quickly developed along the cold front with several reports of large hail, and eventually producing a brief EF-0 Quasi-Linear Convective System (QLCS) tornado (Tornado #7). ||The survey crew teams determined yesterday that there was a nearly 55 mile damage swath, yet found evidence that there were two tornadoes which caused the damage. One tornado began in western Henderson County and moved into central Van Zandt County. This tornado occluded and dissipated, and a second, long track tornado began nearby. This second tornado was the EF-3 which produced damage on the east side of Canton, Fruitvale, Emory, and finally dissipating near Lake Fork. The first tornado had|a track of approximately 12 miles, while the other had a track of nearly 42 miles. ||It is known that four people lost their lives due to these tornadoes, and 59 people were injured.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Henderson County tornado continued into Van Zandt County. A National Weather Service damage survey crew found the start of tornado number three began in Henderson County, approximately 3 miles due south of Eustace. This tornado eventually moved into Van Zandt County, where the storm produced EF4 damage. In  Henderson County, several homes suffered EF2 damage, along with a considerable amount of tree damage and damage to farm buildings. As the storm moved into Van Zandt County, the tornado  grew to a mile wide at the tornado's maximum width. Over 50 homes were either damaged or destroyed, with a continuous path noted between counties.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 700.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first was where a minivan was thrown about 30 yards and a home was lifted off its foundation and left with only its interior walls intact. The second was at the Pilkington Glass plant where one section of the factory was completely destroyed. The tornado then crossed the Illinois River and moved through the south side of Ottawa, producing an 800 yard wide path of EF1 damage to trees and homes.

Large hail was reported in numerous areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The first area of significant damage in the EF2 range was in the area around the La Salle County Nursing Home and La Salle County Highway Department, with lighter damage upstream from this location. The tornado continued into Naplate and produced widespread EF2 damage to numerous homes. EF3 damage also was identified in two locations. The first was where a minivan was thrown about 30 yards and a home was lifted off its foundation and left with only its interior walls intact. The second was at the Pilkington Glass plant where one section of the factory was completely destroyed. The tornado then crossed the Illinois River and moved through the south side of Ottawa, producing an 800 yard wide path of EF1 damage to trees and homes. The fatalities in Ottawa occurred from a tree falling onto two men who were working outside. The tornado then crossed the Illinois River again and continued to produce EF1 and EF0 damage as it exited Ottawa, finally dissipating in the area northwest of Marseilles.

Two tornadoes touched down across inland portions of the Florida Panhandle before sunrise, followed by persistent heavy rainfall that resulted in flooding at several river sites.  As an upper level trough dug southward across the western and central U.S., southerly flow drew moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the tri-state area over the weekend. Upper air soundings measured this increased moisture with precipitable water values around 1.5 inches on Sunday, well above the 90th percentile and a record for the 12z February 11 sounding, although the record for that date and time are below the average max for this time of year. With a cold front and upper level trough west of the area, the persistent deep layer moisture helped to create a favorable set-up for high rainfall amounts.  This wet pattern resulted in copious amounts of rainfall across the tri-state region. The highest rainfall amounts were across the Florida Panhandle where 8 to 10 inches fell with localized areas receiving more than 10 inches across coastal Walton and Bay counties. The highest observed rainfall total was in Walton County, where a 48-hour rainfall total of 11.45 inches was recorded. Across southeast Alabama and portions of southwest Georgia, widespread 6 to 8 inches of rain fell. While one Flash Flood Warning was issued, the majority of the impacts from this event were from moderate rainfall rates over a prolonged period of time as convection trained across the tri-state area.

An environment favorable for significant severe thunderstorms developed as a low-amplitude upper-level trough moved into the region with a deepening surface low passing across far north Alabama.  These two features resulted in a deep column of strong wind shear with 0-6km Bulk Shear values of 60-70 knots. Additionally, moist southerly flow, warm surface temperatures, and colder temperatures aloft yielded a moderately unstable air mass. Initially, thunderstorms were producing large to very large hail. However, the tornado threat increased in the late afternoon and evening hours as wind speeds at low levels increased with the arrival of a low-level jet.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in northern Calhoun Calhoun County and determined that the damage was consistent with an EF3  tornado, with maximum sustained winds near 150 mph. The tornado first touched down west of US Highway 431 north of town of Wellington, where it rapidly intensified and widened. It snapped and uprooted numerous trees along US Highway 431. Several homes were damaged by the falling trees. The tornado proceeded eastward across Websters Road and Broughton Road with scattered tree damage. As the tornado crossed Old Sulphur Springs Road, two homes were damaged with scores of trees snapped or uprooted. At Angel Station Road, the tornado filled the valley from one side to the other and caused extensive tree and home damage. An electrical transmission tower line was toppled at this point, but it was believed that flying debris compromised the structure. The tornado continued eastward and destroyed the sanctuary at West Point Baptist Church. Additional structures were severely damaged at the church. The tornado entered the City of Jacksonville where it gained strength into the EF3 category, with winds around 140 mph. It removed most of the roof and the top floor of two buildings in an apartment complex. The tornado affected the entire campus of Jacksonville State University. Several buildings sustained significant damage. The most intense winds remained north of the campus however, mowing down trees and causing direct damage to homes. As the tornado crossed Highway 21, it caused caused major damage to the Merrill Building. It then moved into a highly populated zone, where scores of homes suffered major damage and rendered uninhabitable. The tornado maintained its strength as it crossed Choccolocco Mountain, and winds funneled up the valley uprooting or snapping trees. It caused major damage to a number of homes on the mountainside. Damaged continued all the way up to just south of the peak of the mountain. As the tornado moved down the eastern side of Choccolocco Mountain, it narrowed substantially and became stronger once it reached the valley below. Stands of trees were wiped out with trunks snapped relatively close to ground level. Perhaps the most intense damage along the entire track occurred along Hollingsworth Road, where a site built home was completely destroyed with only a portion of one interior wall left standing. Debris from this home was blown downstream across a field with some evidence of wind rowing. Hay bales adjacent to the home, estimated at 800 pounds each, were thrown up to 300 yards to the east. Maximum winds at this location were estimated at 150 mph. The tornado continued east-southeast and downed thousands of trees in the Talladega National Forest and crossed into Cleburne County just south of County Road 534.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Most of the severe weather was along and south of a Paducah to Madisonville line. North of that line, serious flash flooding resulted in a fatality. A surface low pressure center tracked rapidly north-northeast from Arkansas to the upper Mississippi Valley, dragging a warm front north across western Kentucky. Instability was adequate for tornadoes and severe storms in the presence of very strong wind shear. A very moist air mass resulted in heavy rainfall, which produced localized flash flooding due to the water-logged ground. Locally 5 to 6 inches of rain had fallen over the previous week. Rainfall rates in these thunderstorms were locally one-half to one inch per hour.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This EF-2 tornado touched down on the south side of Hopkinsville, just west of the junction of the Pennyrile Parkway and U.S. Highway 41. Three apartment buildings near the intersection of the Pennyrile Parkway and U.S. 41 were destroyed. The roof and most walls were blown down on the second story. Another apartment building was heavily damaged. All nine injuries occurred in the apartment complex, which consisted of two-and-a-half story buildings. One car was flipped and blown some distance. Two others were blown from their original positions, and several others were damaged. At least four retail buildings sustained major roof and siding damage, with windows and doors blown in or broken. Four barns were heavily damaged or flattened, and four houses sustained mainly minor roof damage. Two large commercial buildings were damaged, with one sustaining major roof and wall damage. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted. The damage east of the city near Highways 68 and 80 was relatively minor, consisting of uprooted trees, destroyed barns, and shingle damage.

Most of the severe weather was along and south of a Paducah to Madisonville line. North of that line, serious flash flooding resulted in a fatality. A surface low pressure center tracked rapidly north-northeast from Arkansas to the upper Mississippi Valley, dragging a warm front north across western Kentucky. Instability was adequate for tornadoes and severe storms in the presence of very strong wind shear. A very moist air mass resulted in heavy rainfall, which produced localized flash flooding due to the water-logged ground. Locally 5 to 6 inches of rain had fallen over the previous week. Rainfall rates in these thunderstorms were locally one-half to one inch per hour.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This EF-2 tornado touched down on the south side of Hopkinsville, just west of the junction of the Pennyrile Parkway and U.S. Highway 41. Three apartment buildings near the intersection of the Pennyrile Parkway and U.S. 41 were destroyed. The roof and most walls were blown down on the second story. Another apartment building was heavily damaged. All nine injuries occurred in the apartment complex, which consisted of two-and-a-half story buildings. One car was flipped and blown some distance. Two others were blown from their original positions, and several others were damaged. At least four retail buildings sustained major roof and siding damage, with windows and doors blown in or broken. Four barns were heavily damaged or flattened, and four houses sustained mainly minor roof damage. Two large commercial buildings were damaged, with one sustaining major roof and wall damage. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted. The damage east of the city near Highways 68 and 80 was relatively minor, consisting of uprooted trees, destroyed barns, and shingle damage. Peak winds were estimated near 135 mph at the destroyed apartment complex on the south side of Hopkinsville.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 6.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado was videoed as it continued east northeast across a field north of Bill Taylor Road, where it overturned an irrigation pivot. The tornado then crossed Middle Road, flipping a mobile home on its side and atop a vehicle. Four occupants of the mobile home sustained minor injuries. Numerous trees were snapped at this location as well. The tornado reached its widest point as it continued eastward across Newlight Road, causing minor damage to two mobile homes and a shed, and damaging the roof of another house. The tornado then crossed Big Creek into Franklin Parish, and ended as it crossed US Highway 425 just north of Baskin. Here, trees were damaged and a home sustained minor damage.

Debris from this tornado also shattered the windows at Moffitt Mazda on Old Minden Road. The tornado strengthened near the Heart of Bossier Shopping Center and Benton Road where it uprooted several trees as it moved east northeast towards Pierre Bossier Mall.

These storms exhibited rotation almost immediately, and began producing tornadoes across northern Louisiana. Two tornadoes occurred in the NWS Jackson forecast area in association with a cell that tracked from near Rayville, LA north northeastward along the Boeuf River. These storms also produced strong wind as they continued into southeast Arkansas. Overnight, as the cold front associated with the storm system began to advance eastward, a quasi-linear convective system developed over the ArkLaTex and advanced eastward. These storms reached the western portion of the NWS Jackson forecast area after 2:30 am on Saturday, April 14th. Six tornadoes occurred during the early morning hours across southeast Arkansas and northeast Louisiana in association with this line of storms. The storms continued to produce damaging straight-line winds, knocking down trees and power lines in many areas, through the morning hours as it continued eastward into Mississippi.

It crossed through downtown Meridian, causing tree damage to much of the area. It caused structural damage to a few buildings along 14th Street, including roof and facade damage. The tornado reached its strongest intensity of EF2 strength as it neared 23rd Street. Here it snapped a couple of power poles, along with multiple hardwood and softwood trees. In addition, it tore the roof off of an apartment building and a portion of a building at Magnolia Middle School. Video evidence also indicated the tornado tore the roof off of a home near Grandview Avenue along with the loss of some exterior walls. The tornado continued to track northeast and generally followed Highway 45. Damage mainly consisted of trees being snapped or uprooted. Some of these trees fell onto homes. The tornado lifted near Willowlake Road. Maximum estimated wind speed was 115 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado reached its peak intensity with estimated maximum winds of 150 MPH as it crossed Route 130 and entered the town of Elon.  A total of 166 homes suffered damage, and 22 of those homes were considered a total loss.  A motor home was carried about thirty feet and tipped over.  The hardest hit locations were along Nottaway Drive and Deerfield Drive.  Seven people were injured and taken to the hospital from Elon.  As the tornado continued north-northeastward out of Elon, it snapped or uprooted hundreds of trees and caused more minor roof damage to homes.

This was only the third EF3 tornado to occur in the NWS Blacksburg forecast since 1950, and was the longest track tornado within the state of Virginia for the NWS Blacksburg forecast area. The tornado reached its peak intensity with estimated maximum winds of 150 MPH as it crossed Route 130 and entered the town of Elon.  A total of 166 homes suffered damage, and 22 of those homes were considered a total loss.  A motor home was carried about thirty feet and tipped over.  The hardest hit locations were along Nottaway Drive and Deerfield Drive.  Seven people were injured and taken to the hospital from Elon.  As the tornado continued north-northeastward out of Elon, it snapped or uprooted hundreds of trees and caused more minor roof damage to homes.  At 6:25 PM EST, the tornado finally lifted as it began to head up Shady Mountain Ridge, which is about five and a half miles west-northwest of Amherst.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A low pressure system situated northwest of the state slid to the northeast throughout the day, eventually moving into western and central Minnesota. Given its fairly mature frontal situation, an occluded front dropped into northwest Iowa with the warm front extending E/SE from central Iowa and the cold front dropping back to the SW. At the surface within the warm sector observations were favorable with temperatures into the mid 80s and dew points in the low to mid 70s. Looking in more detail, lifted condensation levels were quite low with values under 750 meters, MUCAPE values were modest in the 1000-3000 J/kg range, effective bulk shear was in excess of 40 kts, and effective storm relative helicity was around 200 m2/s2 to name a few. Resulting composite indices correctly highlighted an increased chance for supercells and tornadic potential as seen with supercell composite values in excess of 12 and significant tornado parameter values in the 3 to 5 range in the afternoon. All of which taking into account the general setup, understandably unable to account for storms potentially tapping into additional shear and helicity generated from rooting themselves along outflow boundaries. ||The result was a sizable tornado outbreak across Iowa, including more than a dozen confirmed tornadoes. The tornadoes of most note occurred in the NE Des Moines Metro (specifically Bondurant), Pella, and Marshalltown. The Bondurant area actually experienced two tornadoes, which were concurrently on the ground, but fortunately only one actually caused damage (EF2) within town. The Pella tornado tacked on the north side of town, directly hitting the Vermeer plant, causing EF3 damage. The Marshalltown tornado entered the town from the NW and tracked into the downtown area before exiting and weakening east of town. Widespread damage was experienced in Marshalltown including to the Lennox plant and the County Courthouse.  All in all, while numerous injuries were experienced and millions of dollars of damage, no direct fatalities were reported from the tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Tornado developed about 3 miles north of Pella and moved southeast for its entire length.

This made it the largest December tornado outbreak in the state of Illinois since 1957, and the third largest tornado outbreak across Illinois in any month since 1950.  Within the National Weather Service Lincoln County Warning Area (CWA), 20 tornadoes touched down...with the most significant being an EF-3 tornado that tore through the city of Taylorville in Christian County.  Despite several communities being directly impacted and experiencing major damage, there were no fatalities reported.  The severe weather was caused by a deep area of low pressure that tracked from eastern Kansas into north-central Illinois.  Warm air surging northward ahead of the low allowed temperatures to soar into the upper 50s and lower 60s, resulting in a narrow corridor of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) values of 500-1000J/kg ahead of an approaching occluded front.  Thanks to ample low-level wind shear, numerous supercell thunderstorms developed within the instability axis by mid to late afternoon.  Many of the storms produced tornadoes over the next several hours before the storms gradually weakened by mid-evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado touched down about 3.2 miles east-southeast of Morrisonville at 5:01 PM CST.  It hit a farmstead, destroying 3 barns and severely damaging 4 other out buildings.  The tornado was rated EF2 at this location with maximum wind speeds of 112 mph. The tornado continued moving northeastward, hitting several other outbuildings and snapping trees. The tree and outbuilding damage was classified as EF1 damage with wind speeds of 100-110mph. As the tornado continued to the northeast it snapped more large trees and then hit a log home, removing 25-50% of the roof material. It also snapped many other trees on this property and destroyed a couple of small outbuildings, throwing the debris northward into a field. The tornado was rated EF2 at this location with wind speeds of 115mph. The tornado continued northeastward and moved into a wooded area, snapping and uprooting hundreds of trees along its path. It then curved north-northeastward and moved into Hewittville, a small community on the southern edge of Taylorville. Here the tornado destroyed or severely damaged multiple houses. The first house the tornado hit lost most exterior walls and the entire roof, except for the roof over the attached garage, which was on the north side of the house. It also destroyed a second garage on the property and then completely destroyed a mobile home across the street. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds around 150mph at this location. The tornado continued north-northeastward, destroying a barn, pushing an unanchored home off its foundation and completely destroying another mobile home. This mobile home was partially anchored by wood posts set in slots on a concrete foundation over a basement and crawl space. The resident of this home was badly injured and was found unconscious, trapped under debris in the crawl space. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds of 140mph at this location. As the tornado continued, it snapped and uprooted many more trees and took down power lines and power poles. Many more homes were damaged, to a lesser extent than the first few on the south end of town, with some damage to the homes coming from trees or tree branches falling on the homes. As the tornado moved into the northern part of Hewittville, the wind speeds seemed to increase, completely destroying another home and destroying a large, old building that had been part of an old rail-yard. The tornado also damaged other homes and garages in this area. The tornado was rated EF3 with wind speeds of 155mph at this location. As the tornado tracked north-northeastward, it moved into Taylorville, taking down more trees, power lines/poles, and damaging multiple houses. Several homes lost roofs and garages. The tornado continued through Taylorville damaging other homes and several businesses on West Spresser St. and was rated EF2 with wind speeds of 120-125mph at this point. As the tornado crossed Hwy 29 into the northern part of town, it weakened considerably, with the damage becoming less severe and more sporadic.  The tornado dissipated 1.8 miles north of Taylorville at 5:25 PM CST.  In total, the tornado impacted 506 structures...including major damage to 61 homes and 7 businesses and complete destruction of 28 homes.  Total damage was estimated at $118.9 million.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 118.90M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system spawned at least 10 tornadoes across Middle Tennessee that occurred in the darkness of night, including an EF-2 tornado that struck the Christiana area of Rutherford County, which unfortunately killed one woman and injured three others. Other tornadoes in this outbreak affected central Kentucky, northern and central Alabama, Mississippi and northern Louisiana. This tornado outbreak was the worst to affect Middle Tennessee since the December 23, 2015 tornado outbreak, which also occurred at night during the secondary severe weather season that occurs in the fall and early winter.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Christiana tornado first touched down in far northern Bedford County southwest of Kimmons Road at Longview Road, damaging an outbuilding and blowing down a few trees. This small but very intense tornado moved northeast and quickly increased in intensity to EF-2 as it approached the Bedford/Rutherford County line, severely damaging two homes on the south side of Kingdom Road/Midland Fosterville Road. The tornado then crossed the road into Rutherford County, where a small but well-built brick home had its roof blown off and brick walls blown in. One wall fell onto the homeowner causing minor injuries. Further to the northeast on Williams Road, one barn was heavily damaged and another completely destroyed. The narrow but strong EF-2 tornado continued northeast, carving a well-defined path through forests before striking a new 3000 square foot home on the west side of Midland Crescent Road. This large house, which was poorly attached to its cinder-block foundation, was lifted almost completely intact, flipped upside down, and rotated 90 degrees as it was blown to the north-northwest. One woman inside the home was killed. Numerous trees continued to be blown down further to the northeast across Jones Road. Upon reaching Rock Springs Midland Road, another home that was built in the 1800s took a direct hit from the tornado, losing its roof and all of the third story. The homeowners inside received the warning and took appropriate shelter on the lowest floor, escaping uninjured. Two silos and a barn just north of the home were de-roofed, and several nearby trees were blown down. Curving more to the east-northeast, two 70 foot-tall silos and two sheet metal barns located northwest of Rock Springs Midland Road at Gray Fox Drive were completely destroyed. Another smaller barn was destroyed and adjacent home received roof damage north of Eagle Creek Road. As the tornado crossed a northward bend in Rock Springs Road, a detached garage was completely destroyed while a home suffered minor roof damage. Further to the east, an outbuilding and mobile home were heavily damaged, with debris being blown up to 200 yards to the east. The tornado continued east-northeast, causing minor exterior damage to a home and damaging the roof of a barn. Approaching Rock Springs Midland Road, the tornado completely destroyed a small home on the south side of the roadway, with debris being blown in a cyclonic curved path 200 yards off to the east. The tornado finally weakened to EF-1 as it crossed Rock Springs Midland Road yet again, overturning an old, small mobile home on the north side of the road just west of Highway 231. Two women inside the mobile home were injured. The tornado weakened further as it continued east of Highway 231 where part of the roof of a barn was blown off and several trees were blown down. A few more trees and outbuildings were damaged along Highway 269 and Christiana Lowe Road before the tornado lifted just east of Woodfin Road. The total path length for this tornado in both Bedford and Rutherford Counties was 10.49 miles. The end point and path of this tornado was extended by 2 miles further eastward in May 2020 due to newly available high resolution satellite imagery.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.39M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The other two tornadoes struck rural areas and resulted in mainly tree damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado touched down in a field on the eastern edge of Conneautville and tracked eastward roughly parallel to Highway 198.  The tornado quickly strengthened to EF2 intensity and destroyed a duplex.  A nursing home was also damaged and lost large sections of roofing.  Residents of the nursing home were in the process of being moved to the interior of the building when the tornado struck.  Only one minor injury was reported. The tornado damaged several other homes and structures before lifting near the intersection of Carr Road and Norrisville Road. The maximum winds were estimated up to 115 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 750.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The most intense portions of the system were able to generate localized severe damaging winds and tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado touched down in Baltimore City at about 9:42 PM EDT on Friday evening, November 2, 2018. Initial damage was to a tractor trailer which was blown over on Interstate 95 just north of the Fort McHenry Tunnel. A few trees were topped just west of the interstate, and a fence line blew over on South Newkirk Street just to the east. This damage is consistent with winds of about 70 MPH.||The tornado tracked generally eastward roughly parallel to Holabird Avenue. It blew in large garage doors on both side of the building at Flexi-Van Leasing facility, consistent with wind speeds over 90 MPH.||As it continued eastward, it impacted the north building of the Amazon sorting facility, reaching a peak intensity of around 105 MPH. It blew the roof off a portion of the building, including iron rafters. With the loss of the roof, the eight inch concrete wall panels pushed in and collapsed into the building towards the north end of the west wall. Two fatalities occurred inside the building with the wall collapse. About a dozen truck trailers were pushed over, moved, or rolled by the wind. Two of the trailers were noted to have been blown in an opposite direction of the wind that toppled the wall. Several light stanchions and signs were blown over, and several car windows were blown out by flying debris. Radar data from the FAA's Terminal Doppler Weather Radar near Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport indicated this was around 9:43 PM EDT, and this is when the strongest velocity signature was noted.||The tornado continued east along the south side of Holabird Avenue, uprooting several large trees, and snapping dozens of large branches, consistent with winds of about 80 MPH.||Damage along the entire path was mainly convergent, and while much of the damage was from west-southwest to east-northeast, there were several notable exceptions of damage in differing directions.

Initial damage was to a tractor trailer which was blown over on Interstate 95 just north of the Fort McHenry Tunnel. A few trees were topped just west of the interstate, and a fence line blew over on South Newkirk Street just to the east. This damage is consistent with winds of about 70 MPH.||The tornado tracked generally eastward roughly parallel to Holabird Avenue. It blew in large garage doors on both side of the building at Flexi-Van Leasing facility, consistent with wind speeds over 90 MPH.||As it continued eastward, it impacted the north building of the Amazon sorting facility, reaching a peak intensity of around 105 MPH. It blew the roof off a portion of the building, including iron rafters. With the loss of the roof, the eight inch concrete wall panels pushed in and collapsed into the building towards the north end of the west wall. Two fatalities occurred inside the building with the wall collapse. About a dozen truck trailers were pushed over, moved, or rolled by the wind. Two of the trailers were noted to have been blown in an opposite direction of the wind that toppled the wall. Several light stanchions and signs were blown over, and several car windows were blown out by flying debris. Radar data from the FAA's Terminal Doppler Weather Radar near Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport indicated this was around 9:43 PM EDT, and this is when the strongest velocity signature was noted.||The tornado continued east along the south side of Holabird Avenue, uprooting several large trees, and snapping dozens of large branches, consistent with winds of about 80 MPH.||Damage along the entire path was mainly convergent, and while much of the damage was from west-southwest to east-northeast, there were several notable exceptions of damage in differing directions. An eyewitness fire fighter outside the Baltimore City Fire Department Engine 50 firehouse in the area saw the swirling debris and funnel cloud as it passed. The tornado lifted as it reached the intersection with Dundalk Avenue, which according to radar would have been at about 9:44 PM EDT.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the tornado tracked northeastward along Peachland Lane, it caused widespread major damage to a pecan orchard and a few large farm buildings.

From there, the tornado continued northeast through mostly open farmland, eventually crossing Highways 124, 565 and 84, where additional hardwood tree damage was sustained, along with a couple of snapped wooden power poles. The most significant damage occurred with a cluster of homes located north of Highway 84 in the Chevey Chase community, along Loop Road and at the intersection of Gregory and Grisby roads. In this area, two mobile homes sustained significant damage with one well-anchored home being shifted off of its foundation, while another well-anchored home was lifted up and then rolled over on its side. A family was inside the latter home, and one member interviewed by the survey team described a harrowing experience that resulted in another family member fracturing their arm. Other injuries were limited to minor scrapes and bruises. Other single family homes in the area had minor roof damage and significant damage to sheds. The highest rating of high-end EF-1 with an estimated maximum wind speed of 110 mph was based on the mobile home damage, and this was generally consistent with the degree of tree damage along the entire track. While the wooden power poles could technically fit EF-2 strength, their age and integrity did not impress the survey team. The maximum path width of the tornado was 900 yards in Concordia Parish along with the highest wind speeds of 110 mph.

A few of these thunderstorms became strong enough to produce damaging wind gusts. One storm even produced a brief tornado after interacting with a mesoscale boundary.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service storm survey team confirmed an EF-1 tornado in Chatham County. The tornado began over the Wilmington River, just west of the Savannah Yacht Club on Whitemarsh Island. It developed rapidly as it hit the Savannah Yacht Club. At the time the tornado struck, a boat was being lifted by a crane at the dock. This boat was thrown from the crane back into the water. The boat crane was also pushed by the winds of the tornado off its track, which caused it to crash into a small building near the crane. This small building sustained significant roof damage. One person was reportedly injured inside the building, but the extent of their injuries was unknown. The tornado continued moving east-southeast , snapping and uprooting several trees in a residential area near the end of Bradley Creek Drive. One home in that area also had minor roof damage due to missing shingles. From this point, the tornado strengthened as it moved southeast over Bradley Creek and across portions of Turners Rock Road. This was the region where the most significant damage was found, with at least two dozen large hard and softwood trees either snapped or uprooted. Wind speeds in this area were estimated to be between 100 and 105 mph. The tornado then weakened as it moved on a more easterly path across Turner Creek and onto the western edge of Wilmington Island, just south of Johnny Mercer Boulevard. The tornado broke some tree limbs and branches around Walgreens, then damaged a sign near the Autoplex as it crossed Johnny Mercer Boulevard. Once across Johnny Mercer Boulevard, the weakening tornado skipped over Molly McGuire's restaurant, finally ending in the empty lot just east of the Goodwill store. The roof on the Goodwill store sustained minor damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A few of these thunderstorms became strong enough to produce damaging wind gusts. One storm even produced a brief tornado after interacting with a mesoscale boundary.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service storm survey team confirmed an EF-1 tornado in Chatham County. The tornado began over the Wilmington River, just west of the Savannah Yacht Club on Whitemarsh Island. It developed rapidly as it hit the Savannah Yacht Club. At the time the tornado struck, a boat was being lifted by a crane at the dock. This boat was thrown from the crane back into the water. The boat crane was also pushed by the winds of the tornado off its track, which caused it to crash into a small building near the crane. This small building sustained significant roof damage. One person was reportedly injured inside the building, but the extent of their injuries was unknown. The tornado continued moving east-southeast , snapping and uprooting several trees in a residential area near the end of Bradley Creek Drive. One home in that area also had minor roof damage due to missing shingles. From this point, the tornado strengthened as it moved southeast over Bradley Creek and across portions of Turners Rock Road. This was the region where the most significant damage was found, with at least two dozen large hard and softwood trees either snapped or uprooted. Wind speeds in this area were estimated to be between 100 and 105 mph. The tornado then weakened as it moved on a more easterly path across Turner Creek and onto the western edge of Wilmington Island, just south of Johnny Mercer Boulevard. The tornado broke some tree limbs and branches around Walgreens, then damaged a sign near the Autoplex as it crossed Johnny Mercer Boulevard. Once across Johnny Mercer Boulevard, the weakening tornado skipped over Molly McGuire's restaurant, finally ending in the empty lot just east of the Goodwill store. The roof on the Goodwill store sustained minor damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A deep tap of subtropical moisture surged north into the state ahead of this system on March 12th as a surface low deepened over northeastern New Mexico. Widespread showers and thunderstorms with locally heavy rainfall moved through the entire area on the 12th while heavy snow fell in the mountains above 9,000 feet. Abundant moisture and instability in place over eastern New Mexico led to the development of a large line of showers and thunderstorms with hail, damaging winds, and even a damaging EF-2 tornado in Chaves County. This was the first March tornado documented in Chaves County since 1959, and the earliest known EF-1 of stronger tornado in the state of New Mexico. Six people were injured and dozens of homes and structures were damaged or destroyed. A powerful Pacific cold front then blasted through the state on March 13th as bombogenesis took place along the Front Range of Rockies. Surface low pressure deepened over 24 millibars in 24 hours to record low values for a few sites within New Mexico and Kansas. The combination of a very intense surface pressure gradient and powerful jet stream winds aloft forced widespread strong to damaging winds across much of New Mexico. Peak wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph were common across eastern New Mexico, with sustained wind speeds between 40 and 60 mph for several hours. A large cargo train was blown off a bridge near Logan, completely destroying all 26 cars. Several high profile vehicles were also overturned on Interstate 25, Interstate 40, and U.S. Highway 285. Trees, power lines, and roofs were damaged in many other areas of the state. Snow continued to pile up in the higher terrain through the night of the 13th where storm total snowfall accumulations ranged from 20 to 40 inches.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Just before 6 pm MDT on Tuesday, March 12, 2019, a tornado touched down in Chaves County, about 15 miles south southwest of Dexter. The tornado moved north northeast for approximately 15 minutes before dissipating about one half mile northeast of the community of Dexter. Six people suffered minor injuries, and six homes were substantially damaged or completely destroyed. An additional dozen homes and structures also sustained minor to moderate damage. This was the first March tornado documented in Chaves County since 1959, and the earliest known EF1 or stronger tornado in the state of New Mexico. The last EF2 tornado in New Mexico occurred on May 23, 2012. Damage amounts are a rough estimate.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A deep tap of subtropical moisture surged north into the state ahead of this system on March 12th as a surface low deepened over northeastern New Mexico. Widespread showers and thunderstorms with locally heavy rainfall moved through the entire area on the 12th while heavy snow fell in the mountains above 9,000 feet. Abundant moisture and instability in place over eastern New Mexico led to the development of a large line of showers and thunderstorms with hail, damaging winds, and even a damaging EF-2 tornado in Chaves County. This was the first March tornado documented in Chaves County since 1959, and the earliest known EF-1 of stronger tornado in the state of New Mexico. Six people were injured and dozens of homes and structures were damaged or destroyed. A powerful Pacific cold front then blasted through the state on March 13th as bombogenesis took place along the Front Range of Rockies. Surface low pressure deepened over 24 millibars in 24 hours to record low values for a few sites within New Mexico and Kansas. The combination of a very intense surface pressure gradient and powerful jet stream winds aloft forced widespread strong to damaging winds across much of New Mexico. Peak wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph were common across eastern New Mexico, with sustained wind speeds between 40 and 60 mph for several hours. A large cargo train was blown off a bridge near Logan, completely destroying all 26 cars. Several high profile vehicles were also overturned on Interstate 25, Interstate 40, and U.S. Highway 285. Trees, power lines, and roofs were damaged in many other areas of the state. Snow continued to pile up in the higher terrain through the night of the 13th where storm total snowfall accumulations ranged from 20 to 40 inches.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Just before 6 pm MDT on Tuesday, March 12, 2019, a tornado touched down in Chaves County, about 15 miles south southwest of Dexter. The tornado moved north northeast for approximately 15 minutes before dissipating about one half mile northeast of the community of Dexter. Six people suffered minor injuries, and six homes were substantially damaged or completely destroyed. An additional dozen homes and structures also sustained minor to moderate damage. This was the first March tornado documented in Chaves County since 1959, and the earliest known EF1 or stronger tornado in the state of New Mexico. The last EF2 tornado in New Mexico occurred on May 23, 2012. Damage amounts are a rough estimate.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Minor roof damage to a nearby two story home also occurred.  As the tornado tracked northeast across the eastern side of downtown Columbus, MS, it became evident that the storm had grown in strength a bit as streets became littered with uprooted and snapped hardwood and softwood trees, many of which had fallen on homes, causing significant roof damage. As the tornado moved along 9th street and College Street, damage was noted on top of a cell tower, where portions of the metal structure was evidently bent. By the time the tornado reached 12th Street and 4th Avenue, more extensive damage was noted by way of a brick fence along a single family home getting almost completely destroyed and additional snapped and uprooted hardwood trees.  Wooden power lines were snapped near or at its base at 12th Street and 4th Avenue, where portions of the roof was loss at the nearby Canterbury Townhouses. Littered downed and snapped trees falling on top of homes persisted along the northeast side of downtown Columbus, and southward facing homes along Railroad Street had windows that were blown out. As the tornado continued along its northeast path, it intersected the Hunt Intermediate School along 10th Avenue and 20th Street resulting in significant damage to the roof, and blown out windows along the second floor. Across the street, the Park and Rec Center and Activities Center composed of metal and tin were blown in/collapsed on its entry side. Damage continued along Tuscaloosa Road by way of fence damage along the outskirts of a Loves Truck Stop and snapped softwood and hardwood trees behind the Loves Truck Stop.  The First Pentecostal Church along Tuscaloosa Road had half of its tin roof blown off, and thus resulted in damage done to the inside of its worship area. At the intersection of Tuscaloosa Road and Conway Road, several manufactured buildings had most of its exterior walls and roofs caved in. The one fatality occurred at the intersection of Tuscaloosa Road and Gardner Street, where a structural sound brick building collapsed and the majority of the exterior walls were destroyed.  This tornado began to weaken as it neared the Alabama state line, as several softwood medium size tree limbs and snapped softwood trees occurred north of Highway 50.

The tornado tracked within a couple of miles either side of U.S. Highway 62 for most of its path in McCracken County. The tornado intermittently reached EF-2 intensity from the Ballard County line to about two miles southeast of Barkley Regional Airport. A total of 25 dwellings were damaged along the path in McCracken County. Five businesses were damaged, and 20 residences were damaged. The damage was categorized as minor for 14 of the residences, major for one, and five were destroyed. Major structural damage included partial loss of roofs or walls. Minor damage to homes included the loss of shingles. Dozens of barns, outbuildings, garages, or grain bins were destroyed.  A church, located on U.S. Highway 62 near Highway 305, lost much of the roof structure as well as a large part of a second story exterior wall. This is where the tornado reached its maximum intensity, with estimated peak winds near 125 mph. A total of 40 pre-schoolers were inside a day care facility in the church, but none were directly injured. At least ten vehicles sustained damage in this area near the church. The only injury occurred on U.S. Highway 62 near the church, where a grain bin was blown on top of a pickup truck traveling eastbound. During the final few miles of its track, the tornado weakened as it moved through the western part of the city of Paducah. In the western part of Paducah, the tornado moved across U.S. Highway 60 and the city's main shopping mall. The tornado dissipated shortly after crossing Interstate 24 between exits 3 and 4. The roofs of the shopping mall and a nearby strip mall were damaged. Several businesses in the mall area and along Interstate 24 sustained minor damage, mostly to roofs. Windows were blown out of vehicles and buildings. A moving semi truck was lifted along Interstate 24 and was blown into the median in a jack-knife position. Along the entire track, dozens of utility poles were down, causing extensive power outages for nearly 10,000 customers. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted. Video of the tornado was captured by personnel at the Paducah National Weather Service office, which the tornado missed by about two miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The roofs of the shopping mall and a nearby strip mall were damaged. Several businesses in the mall area and along Interstate 24 sustained minor damage, mostly to roofs. Windows were blown out of vehicles and buildings. A moving semi truck was lifted along Interstate 24 and was blown into the median in a jack-knife position. Along the entire track, dozens of utility poles were down, causing extensive power outages for nearly 10,000 customers. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted. Video of the tornado was captured by personnel at the Paducah National Weather Service office, which the tornado missed by about two miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As favorable upper-level support and deep-layer forcing approached the lower Mississippi River Valley, a surface low pressure developed and moved northeastward into Central Alabama by late morning. Ahead of this surface low, a warm front initially along the Florida Panhandle moved northward allowing for the transport of warm, moist unstable air into southern and southeastern Central Alabama. This frontal boundary eventually became more stationary and stalled out north of the I-85 corridor as the strengthening surface low moved eastward. During this time, a large area of elevated thunderstorms affected portions northern Central Alabama while supercell thunderstorms initiated across the favorable warm sector. As these supercells intensified during the afternoon, parameters became favorable for tornadic thunderstorms in an area along and south of the I-85 corridor.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in far southern Lee County and determined that it was consistent with an EF4 tornado, with maximum sustained winds near 170 mph.||This track is a continuation of a track that began in Macon County. The tornado crossed into Lee County near Lee Road 812 and tracked northeast to County Road 29 where it removed the roof and collapsed several cinder block walls of a church. The tornado continued to intensify as it approached County Road 11, where it peeled sheet metal off of the porch of a home and ripped some sheet metal off of two outdoor storage sheds and continued to uproot numerous pine trees. Debris from structures and their contents were strewn along a tree line to the east of their original location and some evidence of weak ground rowing was observed along the surface tornado path.||The tornado reached its peak intensity just south of the intersection of Lee County Road 36 and Lee County Road 39, where it rolled a manufactured home and emptied its contents nearby on the northern side of the track. Additional damage toward the southern portion of the track included the complete destruction of a house with all debris tossed a short distance from the foundation. The tornado bent the frame of a car around the remnant of a large tree whose upper portion had broken off and totaled three vehicles by severe impacts into the bases of two remaining tree stubs. Farther east on the other side of a small lake, a well-anchored and constructed home was leveled with debris removed from the foundation and anchored bolt screws remaining intact. Toward the northern edge of the tornado, the destruction of two double-wide and a single-wide manufactured home was observed. This was the peak intensity of the tornado due to the combination of damage to the two houses along with extensive severe tree damage including trees snapped at their bases and large trees with expansive root systems uprooted along with some sporadic evidence of ground rowing.||The tornado began to decrease in intensity as it continued east roughly paralleling Lee County Road 39 where two manufactured homes were destroyed with most debris deposited away from the original location and both of the metal frames of the mobile homes could not be located. Another manufactured home was destroyed with its contents deposited in a swath from the site into the remains of a nearby tree line. A car was found in an overturned position against a hardy tree stripped of most limbs with a mattress from a bed wrapped around the mid portion of the tree. A badly mangled metal frame of a manufactured home and debris displaced nearby was all that remained of one residence. Nearby a tractor trailer rig was on its side and shoved around a sturdy tree while a nearby site-built home lost nearly all of its exterior walls with debris remaining on or near the home site. Severe tree destruction continued in this area with trees snapped at their bases and uprooted. To the north of Lee County Road 39, significant debris was deposited in a wooded area where the tornado performed significant timber damage and toppled at least one high-tension power line tower.||After demolishing two double-wide and a single-wide manufactured home the tornado tracked northeast and crossed Lee County Road 51 just north of the intersection with Lee County Road 39. A double-wide manufactured home was moved off of its base and the exterior walls collapsed on a family residence along with significant tree damage.|Some weakening occurred farther east as the tornado crossed Lee County Road 38 where it deposited a large amount of debris into a ragged forested area. The tornado crossed Lee County Road 100 and Lee County Road 166 where it caused damage to trees with some trunks snapped and some trees uprooted.||Tornado damage was observed along Lee County Road 165 and along portions of Lee County Road 40 and Lee County Road 2049. Exterior walls of a family residence were removed and a significant loss of roofing material from a house and a manufactured home were observed. The tornado flipped a manufactured home and deposited its contents nearby along with destroying the roof and walls of a single-wide manufactured home.||The tornado crossed Lee County Road 170 and County Road 175, and then Highway 169 with significant damage to timber along this path. The tornado crossed Lee County Road 245 and Lee County Road 179 with damage to the roof of a house near County Road 239 along with more timber damage. As it approached Smiths Station, the tornado crossed Fullers Lake where it rolled a manufactured home and caused some loss of roofing material to a house. Additional damage occurred along Lee County Road 294 and Lee County Road 298 where a professional building lost some of its roofing materials. Damage also occurred to siding and roofing at several small homes that were not well constructed. As the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 280 it caused some roof damage to a restaurant, damaged a billboard and collapsed a cellular service communications tower. The tornado moved across Lee County Road 318 where some roof damage to homes occurred along with significant timber damage. The tornado moved tracked towards the Chattahoochee River where it caused roof damage to some houses near the river and downed a metal high-tension power line tower. The tornado crossed the Chattahoochee River and continued into Georgia.||There were 23 fatalities and 90 injuries. The American Red Cross estimated 225 homes were destroyed, while another 133 homes sustained major damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As favorable upper-level support and deep-layer forcing approached the lower Mississippi River Valley, a surface low pressure developed and moved northeastward into Central Alabama by late morning. Ahead of this surface low, a warm front initially along the Florida Panhandle moved northward allowing for the transport of warm, moist unstable air into southern and southeastern Central Alabama. This frontal boundary eventually became more stationary and stalled out north of the I-85 corridor as the strengthening surface low moved eastward. During this time, a large area of elevated thunderstorms affected portions northern Central Alabama while supercell thunderstorms initiated across the favorable warm sector. As these supercells intensified during the afternoon, parameters became favorable for tornadic thunderstorms in an area along and south of the I-85 corridor.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in far southern Lee County and determined that it was consistent with an EF4 tornado, with maximum sustained winds near 170 mph.||This track is a continuation of a track that began in Macon County. The tornado crossed into Lee County near Lee Road 812 and tracked northeast to County Road 29 where it removed the roof and collapsed several cinder block walls of a church. The tornado continued to intensify as it approached County Road 11, where it peeled sheet metal off of the porch of a home and ripped some sheet metal off of two outdoor storage sheds and continued to uproot numerous pine trees. Debris from structures and their contents were strewn along a tree line to the east of their original location and some evidence of weak ground rowing was observed along the surface tornado path.||The tornado reached its peak intensity just south of the intersection of Lee County Road 36 and Lee County Road 39, where it rolled a manufactured home and emptied its contents nearby on the northern side of the track. Additional damage toward the southern portion of the track included the complete destruction of a house with all debris tossed a short distance from the foundation. The tornado bent the frame of a car around the remnant of a large tree whose upper portion had broken off and totaled three vehicles by severe impacts into the bases of two remaining tree stubs. Farther east on the other side of a small lake, a well-anchored and constructed home was leveled with debris removed from the foundation and anchored bolt screws remaining intact. Toward the northern edge of the tornado, the destruction of two double-wide and a single-wide manufactured home was observed. This was the peak intensity of the tornado due to the combination of damage to the two houses along with extensive severe tree damage including trees snapped at their bases and large trees with expansive root systems uprooted along with some sporadic evidence of ground rowing.||The tornado began to decrease in intensity as it continued east roughly paralleling Lee County Road 39 where two manufactured homes were destroyed with most debris deposited away from the original location and both of the metal frames of the mobile homes could not be located. Another manufactured home was destroyed with its contents deposited in a swath from the site into the remains of a nearby tree line. A car was found in an overturned position against a hardy tree stripped of most limbs with a mattress from a bed wrapped around the mid portion of the tree. A badly mangled metal frame of a manufactured home and debris displaced nearby was all that remained of one residence. Nearby a tractor trailer rig was on its side and shoved around a sturdy tree while a nearby site-built home lost nearly all of its exterior walls with debris remaining on or near the home site. Severe tree destruction continued in this area with trees snapped at their bases and uprooted. To the north of Lee County Road 39, significant debris was deposited in a wooded area where the tornado performed significant timber damage and toppled at least one high-tension power line tower.||After demolishing two double-wide and a single-wide manufactured home the tornado tracked northeast and crossed Lee County Road 51 just north of the intersection with Lee County Road 39. A double-wide manufactured home was moved off of its base and the exterior walls collapsed on a family residence along with significant tree damage.|Some weakening occurred farther east as the tornado crossed Lee County Road 38 where it deposited a large amount of debris into a ragged forested area. The tornado crossed Lee County Road 100 and Lee County Road 166 where it caused damage to trees with some trunks snapped and some trees uprooted.||Tornado damage was observed along Lee County Road 165 and along portions of Lee County Road 40 and Lee County Road 2049. Exterior walls of a family residence were removed and a significant loss of roofing material from a house and a manufactured home were observed. The tornado flipped a manufactured home and deposited its contents nearby along with destroying the roof and walls of a single-wide manufactured home.||The tornado crossed Lee County Road 170 and County Road 175, and then Highway 169 with significant damage to timber along this path. The tornado crossed Lee County Road 245 and Lee County Road 179 with damage to the roof of a house near County Road 239 along with more timber damage. As it approached Smiths Station, the tornado crossed Fullers Lake where it rolled a manufactured home and caused some loss of roofing material to a house. Additional damage occurred along Lee County Road 294 and Lee County Road 298 where a professional building lost some of its roofing materials. Damage also occurred to siding and roofing at several small homes that were not well constructed. As the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 280 it caused some roof damage to a restaurant, damaged a billboard and collapsed a cellular service communications tower. The tornado moved across Lee County Road 318 where some roof damage to homes occurred along with significant timber damage. The tornado moved tracked towards the Chattahoochee River where it caused roof damage to some houses near the river and downed a metal high-tension power line tower. The tornado crossed the Chattahoochee River and continued into Georgia.||There were 23 fatalities and 90 injuries. The American Red Cross estimated 225 homes were destroyed, while another 133 homes sustained major damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It continued northeast, crossing South Maple Street where the tornado intensified, resulting in widespread tree damage just south of Highway 3012 along Wade Drive, Lind Drive, Robert Street, University Boulevard, and Shelor Drive. Many of these streets were impassable due to the significant number of trees snapped, twisted, and uprooted. Many more trees were downed on Highway 3012 before the tornado tracked northeast towards Westwood Drive. It uprooted a number of trees onto fraternity houses before it crossed the Kansas City Southern Railroad. The tornado crossed the railroad and bent or uprooted several large light poles on Louisiana Tech's softball, baseball, and neighboring athletic fields. It snapped a number of power poles as well. The tornado crossed Tech Drive and damaged a number of dormitories where it removed their metal roofs and blew out windows. It continued northeast where it uprooted more trees on Louisiana Tech's and Ruston High School's campuses. The estimated winds as the tornado tore through the western and northern sections of Louisiana Tech University ranged from 115-130 mph. The tornado crossed Greenwood Cemetery where it intensified again, resulting in a large number of trees being debarked with just the stubs of the large branches remaining in several areas. It continued with several business sustaining significant damage to their exterior brick walls and some interior walls. A hotel along Interstate 20 suffered the collapse of its top story's exterior walls. The tornado continued on to severely damage a gas station between Trenton and Vienna Streets just south of I-20, before crossing the interstate and weakened slightly but still resulted in considerable roof damage to several businesses along North Service Road East. The tornado then began to weaken, with more sporadic wind damage noted as it moved northeast towards Farmerville Highway. It crossed Farmerville Highway near Timberline Court uprooting a number of trees and continued northeast towards Haddox Road. The tornado then lifted and touched back down a few more times with the intermittent damage noted for the rest of its path. It uprooted a few more trees along Stable and Baxter Roads, destroyed a chicken house along Highway 820, before finally lifting just south of Oak Tree Road. The tornado resulted in two fatalities when a tree fell through their home, killing a 35 year old female and her 14 year old son just south of Interstate 20 in Ruston.||The Louisiana State Fire Marshal concluded that 22 buildings were destroyed by the tornado, 154 buildings sustained major damage, with 254 buildings receiving minor damage in the city of Ruston.

As favorable upper-level support and deep-layer forcing approached the lower Mississippi River Valley, a surface low pressure developed and moved northeastward into Central Alabama by late morning. Ahead of this surface low, a warm front initially along the Florida Panhandle moved northward allowing for the transport of warm, moist unstable air into southern and southeastern Central Alabama. This frontal boundary eventually became more stationary and stalled out north of the I-85 corridor as the strengthening surface low moved eastward. During this time, a large area of elevated thunderstorms affected portions northern Central Alabama while supercell thunderstorms initiated across the favorable warm sector. As these supercells intensified during the afternoon, parameters became favorable for tornadic thunderstorms in an area along and south of the I-85 corridor.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in far southern Lee County and determined that it was consistent with an EF1 tornado, with maximum sustained winds near 105 mph.||This tornado was a continuation of the Macon County Tornado. The tornado entered Lee County about 1.2 miles north of Highway 80. It traveled northeast and crossed County Road 29, County Road 11, Cave Mill Road, and Alabama Highway 51. It continued northeast across County Road 166, County Road 165, and finally lifted near County Road 170. Numerous trees were snapped off and uprooted across southern Lee County. Many mobile homes and frame homes suffered varying degrees of roof damage. Two mobile homes were rolled over near the end of the damage path and one person was injured.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The resulting rainfall led to widespread flash flooding, which continued into the morning of May 1st, on head water streams and low water crossings. One live was lost when a camper along Hunter Creek in Douglas County drowned as the campground flooded.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service Storm survey confirmed an EF-2 tornado, produced by a slow moving supercell, tracked from two miles north of Ozark, Missouri to five miles northwest of Rogersville, Missouri. The tornado was on the ground for approximately 20 minutes along its 10.3 mile total track with maximum wind speeds estimated at 134 mph. Along the tornadoes track, which started in Christian County and continued into Greene County, 235 homes and multiple out buildings were damaged. Twelve homes were reported as total losses. As many as 45 vehicles were damaged and three horses were killed when a barn was hit. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted and multiple power poles and lines were downed. Three injuries were reported with two people transported to a local hospital. The tornado touched down just south of North 9th Avenue and East State Highway NN in Christian County. As the tornado proceeded to the northeast it impacted 145 homes in Christian County before moving into Greene County. Of those homes, nine were reported as total losses. Two injuries occurred in one home as the tornado traveled  through a subdivision. Many vehicles were damaged along with multiple outbuildings before the tornado passed into Greene County along East County Line Road just west of South Farm Road 203. The tornado track continued into Greene County where additional EF-2 damage occurred along the remaining eight miles it remained on the ground.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 6.80M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An upper level disturbance ejecting northeast ahead of the trough across portions of East Texas and North Louisiana during the early morning hours of April 13th carried enough elevated instability, shear, and forcing north of an advancing warm front over Southeast Texas and South Louisiana, such that scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developed, with numerous reports of large hail and occasional damaging winds received.

The tornado touched down at a chemical plant and lifted a single wide office trailer, snapping the buried metal tie downs. The trailer was moved 50 feet away, where it landed on several parked vehicles. The roof and 3 walls of the trailer were removed. Two employees and three contractors that were inside the trailer when the tornado struck were injured. Officials at the plant stated that the trailer was installed in February of this year. The tornado continued northeast for 1.5 miles, snapping and uprooting at least 10 power poles before it lifted near New River.

Two trees were snapped along South 37th Street.||The tornado then moved north-northeast, producing damage at the Brookdale Nursing Home on South A Street. Five to ten percent of the roof was removed. One tree, four inches in diameter, was knocked down and several smaller limbs from trees were also knocked down.||The most significant damage was observed at the Richmond Mall where several air handlers on the roof were removed and one was blown northeast onto U.S. 40. The parking lot was also full of debris and a large store on the southwest side of the mall had fifty percent of the glass blown in. On the east side of the mall, a brick wall seven feet high by thirty feet long was destroyed and some of the facade was starting to peel away from the roof. Around that same area, a garage door was blown in. Overall less than five percent of the roof of the mall was removed. On the inside of the mall approximately eight businesses experienced damage, primarily from windows blown out and merchandise blown around. Winds at the Richmond Mall were estimated to be around 85 mph, which is rated at the highest end for an EF0 tornado.||Some of the roof material from the mall landed in three to five businesses on the other side of US 40. Those businesses also received minor damage, with isolated windows being blown out and also some observed damage to signage and siding. A concrete table was moved several feet from its original position, and there was also minor small tree damage. In the service station at the intersection of US 40 and Hayes Arboretum Rd, an adult and a child were sitting in a car when the windows were blown in, causing minor injuries. They were taken to the hospital, treated and released.||Further northeast along Woodside Drive, a large hardwood tree fell to the southwest onto a house and also a tall metal television antenna fell the opposite direction onto the house. Extensive tree damage was also observed near the house, with several two foot diameter trees blown down.

Two trees were snapped along South 37th Street.||The tornado then moved north-northeast, producing damage at the Brookdale Nursing Home on South A Street. Five to ten percent of the roof was removed. One tree, four inches in diameter, was knocked down and several smaller limbs from trees were also knocked down.||The most significant damage was observed at the Richmond Mall where several air handlers on the roof were removed and one was blown northeast onto U.S. 40. The parking lot was also full of debris and a large store on the southwest side of the mall had fifty percent of the glass blown in. On the east side of the mall, a brick wall seven feet high by thirty feet long was destroyed and some of the facade was starting to peel away from the roof. Around that same area, a garage door was blown in. Overall less than five percent of the roof of the mall was removed. On the inside of the mall approximately eight businesses experienced damage, primarily from windows blown out and merchandise blown around. Winds at the Richmond Mall were estimated to be around 85 mph, which is rated at the highest end for an EF0 tornado.||Some of the roof material from the mall landed in three to five businesses on the other side of US 40. Those businesses also received minor damage, with isolated windows being blown out and also some observed damage to signage and siding. A concrete table was moved several feet from its original position, and there was also minor small tree damage. In the service station at the intersection of US 40 and Hayes Arboretum Rd, an adult and a child were sitting in a car when the windows were blown in, causing minor injuries. They were taken to the hospital, treated and released.||Further northeast along Woodside Drive, a large hardwood tree fell to the southwest onto a house and also a tall metal television antenna fell the opposite direction onto the house. Extensive tree damage was also observed near the house, with several two foot diameter trees blown down.

Many of the thunderstorms produced tornadoes, including a few strong to violent tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado appeared to have first touched down west of Celina, near the intersection of Township Line Road and Bunker Hill Road, where about half of a barn's metal roof was removed and strewn in a narrow path to the east-northeast. At least two other barns also lost nearly half of their metal roofing in the vicinity of Bunker Hill Road. Numerous trees in this area, with trunk diameters of 18 to 24 inches, were also snapped and blown down in various directions. This type of damage was consistent with wind speeds of up to 90 mph and associated with an EF1 tornado. ||The next damage occurred to homes and adjacent outbuildings along Mud Pike Road, immediately southeast of the intersection with State Route 118. Two homes retained their main roof structure but many shingles were removed. Two outbuildings and a larger barn were destroyed, likely resulting from EF1 tornado winds of 100 to 110 mph. Additional damage occurred along Hellwarth Road, just south of the intersection with Fairground Road. Several homes and outbuildings were damaged, with the most serious being a home that lost much of its roof and some exterior walls. High-end EF2 tornado winds of 125 to 135 mph likely caused the worst damage at this location. ||The tornado path continued generally along Fairground Road from just east of the intersection with Hellwarth Road to the western corporation limit of the city of Celina. Homes, outbuildings, trees and utility poles were damaged here, and a free-standing cellular communication tower was knocked down. At least two homes suffered partial roof loss and one home lost its entire roof. The cellular tower was a lattice structure at least 300 feet tall and two of the three support attachments at the ground were broken. A 50 to 100 yard swath of trees were snapped and uprooted in a forested area leading up to the western edge of Celina. The damage to the cellular tower and trees was indicative of EF2 tornado wind speeds of 125 to 135 mph. ||More substantial damage was observed just inside the western corporation limit of the city of Celina, along Fairground Road. At least a dozen homes were severely damaged here, with roofs completely uplifted and removed, along with many exterior walls collapsed. One residence was completely lifted from its foundation, with interior walls largely intact, and dropped in an adjoining field approximately 70 yards to the north-northeast. This residence was anchored to a cinder block foundation, with the upper level or two of blocks breaking from the rest under the force of the wind. Significant mud spatter was also observed on what remained of these homes, especially on the north and northeast facing sides, implying a strongly rotating column of air in contact with a nearby muddy field. This type of damage was consistent with wind speeds up to 150 mph and associated with an EF3 tornado. In this area along Fairground Road, a vehicle was thrown into a house, killing a person inside of the house. ||Significant damage continued into a cluster of homes near and northwest of the intersection of Fairground Road and Touvelle Street in Celina. At least two dozen of these homes had partial or complete roof failure and many exterior walls collapsed. Two residences on either side of Jill Avenue were missing large portions of their exterior walls, indicative of winds as high as 140 to 150 mph and associated with an EF3 tornado. Evidence of multiple vortices within the tornado was also evident in the debris pattern here. Several cars were displaced by the wind and uplift in this neighborhood. A thick layer of mud was also spattered on the east and northeast facing sides of these structures, largely opposite the direction of the incoming tornado. ||The degree and extent of damage started to gradually lessen east-northeast from near Touvelle Street to U.S. 127. From there the tornado continued to track farther northeast to near the community of Neptune. An approximately 100 yard swath of trees were snapped and uprooted in a small forested area between U.S. 127 and Celina-Mendon Road, north of Myers Road. A garage roof was displaced off the main structure along Celina-Mendon Road, between State Route 197 and Howick Road, causing exterior walls to also collapse. This damage was likely the result of EF2 tornado winds of 115 to 125 mph. ||A garage was destroyed along State Route 197, just northeast of the intersection with Rice Road. A house farther northeast along Riley Road, just south of the intersection with State Route 197, suffered partial roof removal along with the collapse of a few exterior walls. Based on the damage, wind speeds here were estimated to be at the upper-end of the EF1 range, between 100 and 110 mph. A debris path was evident into the field immediately east-northeast, where the tornado appeared to finally lift.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It moved east and entered Miami County at 2128EST along Hall Road, about a half mile northwest of Potsdam. ||As the tornado entered Miami County, significant tree damage occurred on State Route 721 south of Laura. Structural damage began to occur near the intersection of Wright Road and Markley Road, with partial roof loss to an outbuilding. On Ditmer Road and South Shiloh Road, nearly every property sustained tree damage, some of which was significant.||As the tornado neared State Route 571, structural damage became much more severe. Several homes on State Route 571 between South Shiloh Road and South Range Line Road were rendered uninhabitable. Many homes had at least partial roof removal and some sustained complete roof removal. A few homes suffered the collapse of some exterior walls and while this was more common with garage walls, it also occurred on a few well-built walls away from garages. At one home, a lawn tractor was thrown out into the adjacent field to the northeast.||Damage was very similar across the field on South Range Line Road. Two homes experienced complete roof removal, with one also having walls collapse on multiple sides of the second story of the home. Mud splatter on all sides of structures was significant, and one vehicle interior was largely covered in mud after the failure of the rear window. Another home lost a significant portion of the roof, as well as losing quite a bit of material from an interior wall after the winds had entered the structure.  The rotating winds of the tornado were very obvious on this north-to-south oriented road. Along the northern portion of the tornado track, one home lost its entire roof and had it deposited hundreds of feet into the field to the west, opposite the direction of motion of the tornado. Along the southern portion of the tornado track, debris accumulated across the field, along a tree line over a quarter mile away to the east.||The width of this tornado was most evident as it passed east across Elleman Road. Damage was observed as far south as the intersection with State Route 571 and as far north as several spots along State Route 55. While the damage on State Route 55 was primarily to roofing material and trees, more significant structural damage continued to be observed a little farther south on Elleman Road.||The tornado maintained its intensity as it crossed State Route 48 about a mile and a half north of downtown West Milton. Tree damage was severe along this road, with canopy loss even to trees that remained standing. Many structures were heavily damaged or destroyed. The only known injury from this tornado occurred when a trailer home was flipped over. A well-built brick home suffered the collapse of large portions of the west-facing and south-facing walls, with near-complete roof removal. A garage adjacent to this property was flattened. A trailer home just to the south was completely destroyed, with the failure of nearly all exterior walls and even some interior walls. Debris from these homes and structures was carried about a half mile across the field, stopped only by the tree line from traveling farther.||Widespread tree damage and moderate structural damage continued to be observed as the tornado moved east across Calumet Road, Kessler-Frederick Road, and Kessler Road. One home on Kessler Road lost its entire roof and a full-size camper was thrown and wedged against the garage.||Less significant damage was observed after passing Kessler Road, where the tornado turned from the east to the southeast. Damage observed on Nashville Road south of West Kessler Cowlesville Road was limited to trees, and it is believed that the tornado dissipated somewhere in this vicinity.||This tornado was responsible for a lengthy swath of EF2 level damage, generally 120 to 130 mph, extending from State Route 571 to Kessler Road. However, damage to a few homes on State Route 571, South Range Line Road, and State Route 48, was notably more significant, with a combined degree of roof loss and exterior wall collapse that warranted an estimate of 140 mph winds, within the EF3 category.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Shortly after, the tornado severely damaged several structures while tracking south, including leveling several buildings at the lumber yard, destroying the civic center, and causing significant damage to the school.  The start of the school year was delayed by two weeks due to extent of the damage. Two people were (directly) injured by debris when a garage collapsed on them while moving vehicles to safety. Numerous power transmission poles and lines were removed by the tornado.  Around 2 miles south southeast of Burke, the tornado struck a residence causing severe damage to the roof.  Shortly thereafter, the tornado lifted before reaching the intersection of 295th Street and 345th Avenue after traveling a bit less than 4 miles.  The path width reached a maximum of 75 yards within the city of Burke. Up to 3000 trees were damaged by the tornado in and near Burke.

As a strong upper-level wave dropped from Montana into North Dakota, storms initiated after 1400CST along a pre-frontal surface trough across north central South Dakota.  As storms moved into an environment with deep-layer effective shear of 40 to 50 knots, the southernmost cells produced very large hail as well as a brief tornado near Burke later in the evening. Two people were injured when the garage they were moving cars into at the time of the storm was destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado developed and touched down in the heart of town near Washington and 7th streets, causing damage to several trees at the touchdown point.  Shortly after, the tornado severely damaged several structures while tracking south, including leveling several buildings at the lumber yard, destroying the civic center, and causing significant damage to the school.  The start of the school year was delayed by two weeks due to extent of the damage. Two people were (directly) injured by debris when a garage collapsed on them while moving vehicles to safety. Numerous power transmission poles and lines were removed by the tornado.  Around 2 miles south southeast of Burke, the tornado struck a residence causing severe damage to the roof.  Shortly thereafter, the tornado lifted before reaching the intersection of 295th Street and 345th Avenue after traveling a bit less than 4 miles.  The path width reached a maximum of 75 yards within the city of Burke. Up to 3000 trees were damaged by the tornado in and near Burke. Property damage costs are rough estimates.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 7.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

While overall instability was around 500 J/KG, the 0-3km MLCAPE was over 125 J/KG across southwest Iowa accounting for around a third of the overall updraft strength.  Effective helicity values were nearly 500 m2/s2.   The strongly sheared environment along with decent near surface instability led to the development of two tornadoes across southwest Iowa during the night.  The first tornado was an EF-1 and virtually destroyed an old farm building southeast of Anita.  The second more powerful tornado occurred southeast of Adair and impacted a few different farmsteads.  The final farmstead encountered received EF-2 damage producing 1 injury and 1 fatality.  The tornado crossed Interstate 80 and then remained in rural cropland for the remainder of the path.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Tornado developed south southeast of Adair and moved quickly north.  Initial damage was mainly to trees, grain bins and outbuildings.  Three houses were encountered by the tornado with the first two receiving EF0 damage.  The third house had the roof removed with several of the outside walls collapsing, but the inside walls remaining intact.  Two individuals were sleeping inside when the tornado arrived with one injury and one fatality occurring.  This structure sustained EF2 damage with the tornado passing over Interstate 80 and remaining in rural cropland for the remainder of its path in Adair County.  The tornado then crossed into Guthrie County before dissipating.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Initially the tornado affected rural areas, but as it moved east-northeast, it moved through the northwestern portion of an automobile dealership at the northwest corner of Interstate 40 and US-81. There it overturned or displaced a number of vehicles and removed the roof and collapsed many exterior walls of an automobile service building.||Immediately northeast of the automobile dealership, the tornado moved through the southeastern portion of a mobile home park destroying many mobile homes. Although the tornado was relatively narrow, the destruction of mobile homes was complete in the path while mobile homes just a couple of blocks away suffered minimal damage.  Two residents of one mobile home were killed when their home was destroyed.||Just to the northeast of the mobile home park, the tornado hit a two-story motel. Most walls of the second story were collapsed in the portion of the motel that was in the most intense part of the tornado path and the tornado was rated EF3 at this motel. ||Crossing US-81, the tornado significantly damaged another automotive service building and produced significant roof damage to a home on SE 27th Street. The tornado weakened as it moved east-northeast along and just north of SE 27th Street damaging trees before dissipating near Alfadale Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 400.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Initially the tornado affected rural areas, but as it moved east-northeast, it moved through the northwestern portion of an automobile dealership at the northwest corner of Interstate 40 and US-81. There it overturned or displaced a number of vehicles and removed the roof and collapsed many exterior walls of an automobile service building.||Immediately northeast of the automobile dealership, the tornado moved through the southeastern portion of a mobile home park destroying many mobile homes. Although the tornado was relatively narrow, the destruction of mobile homes was complete in the path while mobile homes just a couple of blocks away suffered minimal damage.  Two residents of one mobile home were killed when their home was destroyed.||Just to the northeast of the mobile home park, the tornado hit a two-story motel. Most walls of the second story were collapsed in the portion of the motel that was in the most intense part of the tornado path and the tornado was rated EF3 at this motel. ||Crossing US-81, the tornado significantly damaged another automotive service building and produced significant roof damage to a home on SE 27th Street. The tornado weakened as it moved east-northeast along and just north of SE 27th Street damaging trees before dissipating near Alfadale Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 400.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Notable tree damage was observed at the start of the track. The tornado crossed the reservoir and struck the peninsula where Cedar Creek Golf Course is located. Significant tree damage occurred along the track in the form of uprooted and snapped large hardwood trees. Some trees were snapped near the base, but most were snapped about half way up the trunk. The tornado appeared to strengthen to EF-2 winds as it crossed the golf course. On the east side of the peninsula, the tornado significantly damaged a house, lifting the roof off over an attached indoor swimming pool and part of the roof over the main house. The tornado then crossed the reservoir again, did minor tree damage across Hwy 175 and dissipated just past the highway. Maximum winds with the tornado were estimated at 120 mph.

Notable tree damage was observed at the start of the track. The tornado crossed the reservoir and struck the peninsula where Cedar Creek Golf Course is located. Significant tree damage occurred along the track in the form of uprooted and snapped large hardwood trees. Some trees were snapped near the base, but most were snapped about half way up the trunk. The tornado appeared to strengthen to EF-2 winds as it crossed the golf course. On the east side of the peninsula, the tornado significantly damaged a house, lifting the roof off over an attached indoor swimming pool and part of the roof over the main house. The tornado then crossed the reservoir again, did minor tree damage across Hwy 175 and dissipated just past the highway. Maximum winds with the tornado were estimated at 120 mph. One person suffered minor injuries.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Through town, the tornado produced a continuous path of snapped and uprooted trees, broken tree limbs, and minor structural damage to homes and businesses. As it crossed North 16th Avenue, it produced more significant damage to several businesses and a hotel, including briefly lifting the roof of the Super 8, collapsing portions of a small strip mall and standalone office building, and causing damage to the exterior and roofing of the Piggly Wiggly. A semi-truck and flatbed trailer carrying automobiles were also overturned in this area. The tornado continued to damage or blow down trees as it passed through the neighborhoods and the warehouse district of downtown, with several trees falling onto and damaging homes and cars. The Nora Davis Magnet School sustained heavy roof damage and a nearby home lost its entire roof and carport as the tornado crossed Interstate 59 and moved east of Laurel. It was in this area that the most intense damage occurred and was rated at EF3. A few electrical transmission trusses were collapsed, and the Wade Services manufacturing plant took a direct hit and experienced a total collapse of its structures. The tornado remained east of US Highway 11 as it crossed through Erata and Sandersville, causing a continuous path and uprooted trees. It briefly passed through the far northwestern corner of Wayne County northwest of Eucutta and then crossed into southern Clarke County near County Road 230. Damage to many trees and a few homes occurred as it continued northeast across US Highway 45 and into Alabama where MS Highway 18 meets the state line near Hinton, Alabama. Two mobile homes in southern Clarke County were rolled and severely damaged, and two single family homes in the county experienced severe roof damage. Residents in both mobile homes received advance warning of the tornado and were able to shelter in another location before it hit.  The tornado continued into Alabama before it dissipated. Two very minor injuries occurred in Sandersville during the tornado from debris. A third injury occurred three days later on the 19th when a man was cleaning up after the tornado. A cracked tree fell on him and broke his jaw. Maximum winds were 140 mph. Total path length was 51.48 miles in Mississippi but 61.34 miles total.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A semi-truck and flatbed trailer carrying automobiles were also overturned in this area. The tornado continued to damage or blow down trees as it passed through the neighborhoods and the warehouse district of downtown, with several trees falling onto and damaging homes and cars. The Nora Davis Magnet School sustained heavy roof damage and a nearby home lost its entire roof and carport as the tornado crossed Interstate 59 and moved east of Laurel. It was in this area that the most intense damage occurred and was rated at EF3. A few electrical transmission trusses were collapsed, and the Wade Services manufacturing plant took a direct hit and experienced a total collapse of its structures. The tornado remained east of US Highway 11 as it crossed through Erata and Sandersville, causing a continuous path and uprooted trees. It briefly passed through the far northwestern corner of Wayne County northwest of Eucutta and then crossed into southern Clarke County near County Road 230. Damage to many trees and a few homes occurred as it continued northeast across US Highway 45 and into Alabama where MS Highway 18 meets the state line near Hinton, Alabama. Two mobile homes in southern Clarke County were rolled and severely damaged, and two single family homes in the county experienced severe roof damage. Residents in both mobile homes received advance warning of the tornado and were able to shelter in another location before it hit.  The tornado continued into Alabama before it dissipated. Two very minor injuries occurred in Sandersville during the tornado from debris. A third injury occurred three days later on the 19th when a man was cleaning up after the tornado. A cracked tree fell on him and broke his jaw. Maximum winds were 140 mph. Total path length was 51.48 miles in Mississippi but 61.34 miles total.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This tornado removed the roofs from several homes and caused some of the outer walls  to collapse.  It blew out a wall of a large metal building at the Boys Ranch, destroyed several outbuildings and continued to damage trees as it crossed over Twin Buttes Reservoir.  Then the tornado entered the Southland Subdivision, located about 5.5 miles southwest of San Angelo where the tornado broadened to nearly a mile wide as it weakened.  It damaged shingles on many roofs and a chimney, it toppled fences, broke windows, uprooted some trees and broke many tree limbs across the Southland Subdivision.  The tornado continued to cause similar damage as it moved northeast into the College Hills Subdivision.  The tornado then began to decrease in width and increase in strength near Angelo State University (ASU).  The tornado damaged roofs, broke a large church window, and destroyed a gasoline canopy, fences and trees near ASU.  This tornado even tore HVAC Units from the MHMR Building near downtown San Angelo.  The twister crossed Loop 306 near Main Street and intensified to an EF-2 as it struck the Bradford Elementary Subdivision in the north part of San Angelo.  It destroyed 39 homes and damaged about 90 homes as it removed residential roofs and collapsed outer walls.  The strong tornado threw an automobile into a residence and snapped tree trunks.

Upper level disturbances moved over West Texas along the edge of this upper trough. A surface trough was over far West Texas and resulted in an abundance of moisture across the area. The atmosphere quickly became unstable as temperatures warmed up at the surface. A dryline was backed up to the higher terrain of West Texas and southeast New Mexico with very good wind shear and atmospheric rotation in place. During the late evening hours, upper lift increased with the approaching upper trough and the area was in a favorable position for lift with the upper jet stream. A low-level jet stream also moved across the area providing more lift. A Pacific front associated with the upper trough moved east and interacted with the dryline to create additional lift. These conditions resulted in thunderstorms rapidly developing and becoming severe with large hail, strong and damaging winds, tornadoes, and flash flooding across West Texas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A thunderstorm moved across Midland County and produced a tornado 21 miles southeast of the City of Midland. This tornado was first viewed from near the intersection of Farm to Market Road 1787 and State Highway 349, looking southeastward. Primary indications are that the tornado developed 21 miles southeast of the City of Midland, in open fields south of County Road 300 and east of State Highway 349. The tornado moved northeastward, snapping power poles along County Road 300, and produced significant damage along County Road 1160 and Farm to Market Road 1379. The snapped power poles, the damage to two RVs along County Road 1160, and the damage to manufactured trailers along FM 1379 are all indicative of EF-2 tornado damage. The tornado lifespan was 10 minutes long with an estimated peak wind of 125 mph. The cost of damage is a very rough estimate.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Upper level disturbances moved over West Texas along the edge of this upper trough. A surface trough was over far West Texas and resulted in an abundance of moisture across the area. The atmosphere quickly became unstable as temperatures warmed up at the surface. A dryline was backed up to the higher terrain of West Texas and southeast New Mexico with very good wind shear and atmospheric rotation in place. During the late evening hours, upper lift increased with the approaching upper trough and the area was in a favorable position for lift with the upper jet stream. A low-level jet stream also moved across the area providing more lift. A Pacific front associated with the upper trough moved east and interacted with the dryline to create additional lift. These conditions resulted in thunderstorms rapidly developing and becoming severe with large hail, strong and damaging winds, tornadoes, and flash flooding across West Texas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A thunderstorm moved across Midland County and produced a tornado 21 miles southeast of the City of Midland. This tornado was first viewed from near the intersection of Farm to Market Road 1787 and State Highway 349, looking southeastward. Primary indications are that the tornado developed 21 miles southeast of the City of Midland, in open fields south of County Road 300 and east of State Highway 349. The tornado moved northeastward, snapping power poles along County Road 300, and produced significant damage along County Road 1160 and Farm to Market Road 1379. The snapped power poles, the damage to two RVs along County Road 1160, and the damage to manufactured trailers along FM 1379 are all indicative of EF-2 tornado damage. The tornado lifespan was 10 minutes long with an estimated peak wind of 125 mph. The cost of damage is a very rough estimate.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado began around the intersection of W Minnesota Ave and N Ridgewood Ave, near the West Minnesota Estates neighborhood. The tornado generally tracked east-northeast across the city resulting in many downed medium to large tree branches, downed power lines, and numerous large trees were uprooted, which led to many local and major roadways being blocked. Many homes and vehicles suffered moderate to major damage as large tree branches or entire trees fell on them.||The tornado briefly intensified just southwest of the intersection of W Plymouth Avenue and N Spring Garden Avenue where EF-1 damage occurred. Two storage facility buildings suffered major roof collapse with winds estimated at 80-90 mph. The tornado continued to produce EF-0 damage along and south of W Plymouth Avenue as it moved towards Woodland Blvd. ||As the tornado reached Woodland Blvd. it quickly intensified and reached its widest point at approximately 550 yards. Extensive EF-1 damage was seen from Woodland Blvd. east to Amelia Avenue, and from E Kentucky Ave south to E Woodmont Road, with winds estimated between 90-100 mph. Damage was most significant along E Washington Ave between N Alabama Ave and N Amelia Ave, just east of US Hwy 17 where winds are estimated between 110-120 mph. Two homes had total roof loss, with a few others receiving moderate to major roof and structural damage. Several healthy tree trunks were found snapped and twisted near the base, with numerous smaller trees snapped midway. Videos taken along N Woodland Blvd revealed that a box delivery truck was tipped over and a car was flipped.||The tornado dissipated just east of the Lake Lindley subdivision between Jacobs Road and Lake Talmadge Drive where many large branches were snapped near the tops of the trees. ||There was one injury and no fatalities reported. Preliminary damage estimates from the Volusia County Property Appraiser indicate total damage of approximately $8,010,339. There were 163 damaged structures, with 49 sustaining minor damage, 40 sustaining major damage, and 5 that were destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8.01M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These storms produced two tornadoes in western Volusia County, including a rare August EF-2. In addition, other thunderstorms produced strong winds and hail along the Volusia and Brevard County coasts.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service Damage Survey confirmed that a strong tornado moved through North DeLand along a 4.6 mile long path with peak winds estimated between 110-120 mph. The tornado began around the intersection of W Minnesota Ave and N Ridgewood Ave, near the West Minnesota Estates neighborhood. The tornado generally tracked east-northeast across the city resulting in many downed medium to large tree branches, downed power lines, and numerous large trees were uprooted, which led to many local and major roadways being blocked. Many homes and vehicles suffered moderate to major damage as large tree branches or entire trees fell on them.||The tornado briefly intensified just southwest of the intersection of W Plymouth Avenue and N Spring Garden Avenue where EF-1 damage occurred. Two storage facility buildings suffered major roof collapse with winds estimated at 80-90 mph. The tornado continued to produce EF-0 damage along and south of W Plymouth Avenue as it moved towards Woodland Blvd. ||As the tornado reached Woodland Blvd. it quickly intensified and reached its widest point at approximately 550 yards. Extensive EF-1 damage was seen from Woodland Blvd. east to Amelia Avenue, and from E Kentucky Ave south to E Woodmont Road, with winds estimated between 90-100 mph. Damage was most significant along E Washington Ave between N Alabama Ave and N Amelia Ave, just east of US Hwy 17 where winds are estimated between 110-120 mph. Two homes had total roof loss, with a few others receiving moderate to major roof and structural damage. Several healthy tree trunks were found snapped and twisted near the base, with numerous smaller trees snapped midway. Videos taken along N Woodland Blvd revealed that a box delivery truck was tipped over and a car was flipped.||The tornado dissipated just east of the Lake Lindley subdivision between Jacobs Road and Lake Talmadge Drive where many large branches were snapped near the tops of the trees. ||There was one injury and no fatalities reported. Preliminary damage estimates from the Volusia County Property Appraiser indicate total damage of approximately $8,010,339. There were 163 damaged structures, with 49 sustaining minor damage, 40 sustaining major damage, and 5 that were destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8.01M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A supercell thunderstorm developed and moved across portions of the Pine Belt and brought a violent tornado across the region, for the second time in as many weeks.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This violent tornado began over southeastern Walthall County in a field just west of Reagan Road and moved east northeastward along MS Highway 48, producing significant tree damage and minor damage to a few homes. It crossed into Marion County near the intersection of MS Highway 48 and Mt Bethel Road. The tornado then began to move more northeastward as it moved into southwestern Marion County, uprooting and snapping several softwood trees, causing minor roof damage to a home, and destroying an outdoor small shed along New Hope Road. It also snapped several trees and peeled the tin roof of a barn along A Pittman, Marks and Davis Roads. The tornado intensified relatively quickly once it moved northeast, snapping the majority of trees close to the ground in a wooded area east of New Hope Road. The basis for the low-end EF4 rating was a home on Johnson Road that was completely destroyed with its debris pushed to a corner of the foundation leaving residual vinyl flooring and a few of its anchor bolts bent. Furthermore, across the street from the aforementioned home, in a field a few of the snapped trees sustained patchy debarking. A higher rating was not assigned because the contents of the home were not spread a significant distance from the foundation and debris remained over a part of the slab. Nonetheless, significant damage to the home and nearby trees occurred. In addition, multiple wooden power poles were snapped, several other homes had significant roof damage and multiple mobile homes were completely destroyed, resulting in one fatality. Continual uprooting and snapping of trees was observed at Hurricane Creek Road, in addition to minor roof damage to a shed and a one-story home. When the tornado crossed Hurricane Creek Church Road, it caused significant roof damage to the Hurricane Creek Baptist Church and the nearby pastor's home. Behind the pastor's home was a large 40-foot shed that sat partially on cinder blocks and partially on a slab that was bolted down. This shed was completely destroyed as it was blown a few feet away. Several headstones in a cemetery were knocked over at this location as well. Additional roof damage to multiple homes and the uprooting and snapping of numerous trees along Hurricane Creek Road to the intersection of MS Highway 35. When the tornado reached MS Highway 35, it snapped multiple wooden power-poles and continued snapping trees. It continued east- northeast to Old MS Highway 35 causing numerous snapping of hardwood trees and the removal of a portion of a one-story home roof. The tornado continued moving east-northeast across the Pearl River bottom, when it reached MS Highway 43, multiple wooden power-poles were snapped, some minor roof damage occurred to some one-story homes and hardwood trees were snapped. Just east of MS Highway 43 along Joe Magee Road, a brick home sustained significant damage as the roof was completely destroyed and a few exterior walls were collapsed. A swath of snapped softwood trees was noted along Abrams Road thus producing EF2 damage.||Once the tornado reached MS Highway 13 and surrounding streets such as Pine Burr Road and Firetower Road near the Marion and Lamar county borders, a slight decline in strength was noted, though its path remained wide. Although, it was still snapping large tree limbs and snapping and uprooting some softwood trees, several of which fell onto wooden power poles and caused them to fall. The tornado maintained its east northeastward track, knocking thousands of trees down along with numerous power lines and poles down across the western portions of Lamar County. This tree damage was consistent with high end EF1 winds peaking between 100-110 mph. Around a dozen homes were damaged starting from Luther Saucier Rd to Purvis to Columbia Road, including one old mobile home that was completely destroyed. As the tornado continued to track east northeastward to the north of Purvis. It crossed Purvis Oloh Road, MS Highway 589 along with US 11. Hundreds of trees were damaged along with many power lines down. Some minor damage occurred to some homes. The tornado was slightly weaker here with winds between 90- 100mph. The tornado crossed I-59 into Forrest County along Ford and Elks Lodge Road in the Dixie community. Hundreds of trees were damaged along with many power lines down. Sheds and several homes had minor damage and one mobile home had the roof blown off. The tornado then crossed US 49 a couple miles north of Southgate Road. The tornado proceeded into Camp Shelby. At Camp Shelby, there were widespread snapped and uprooted trees. Multiple structures across the north half, in and around Lee Avenue to Glenn Walker Lake, had varying degrees of minor to moderate roof damage from the tornado or fallen trees. The park and camper area on the north end of the lake was impacted. One person was injured here as a large tree fell on a truck. The tornado then crossed over US 98 just west of the Perry County line. It continued into Perry County along the Leaf River bottom, snapping and uprooting trees. It continued to track just south of Old River Road before dissipating along Old River Road three miles northwest of New Augusta. Total path length was 53.76 miles. Maximum sustained winds for the entire tornado were 170 mph, but were noted to be 100 mph in Forrest County. Total path width was 2275 yards(1.29 miles).<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado strengthened significantly and widened to 0.65 miles wide as it crossed the Cumberland River into the John C. Tune Airport area, causing strong EF-2 damage to numerous planes, hangers, warehouses, and other buildings from Cockrill Bend Way to Briley Parkway. Around $200 million in damage was reported at John C. Tune Airport alone. Continuing eastward, the tornado caused severe damage to the Tennessee State Prison and blew down numerous high-tension transmission towers as it again crossed the Cumberland River into North Nashville, with up to EF-2 damage to farm facilities at Tennessee State University and dozens of homes between I-40 and Buchanan Street. EF-2 damage continued across the Germantown neighborhood just 1/2 mile north of downtown Nashville with several damaged and destroyed apartment complexes, homes, and businesses. The tornado intensified further as it tracked through East Nashville, with EF-3 damage to businesses and other buildings in the Five Points area and EF-2 damage to homes in the Lockeland Springs and Barclay Drive neighborhoods. Two people were killed in Five Points after leaving a bar and going outside as the tornado struck. After crossing the Cumberland River yet again, the tornado weakened as it moved northeast through the Donelson Hills and Lincoya Hills neighborhoods of Donelson, but strengthened again to a strong EF-3 in the Standford Estates area where several homes were leveled. The tornado weakened slightly but continued to cause EF-2 damage to homes and businesses as it turned southeast and passed through Hermitage into Wilson County. ||Dozens of homes continued to sustain up to EF-2 damage as the tornado moved across the Chandler Road and Triple Crown Parkway neighborhoods of Mount Juliet. Turning more to the northeast, the tornado strenghtened to strong EF-3 and leveled numerous homes in the Catalpa Drive and Clearview Drive neighborhoods, with one elderly couple killed on Catalpa Drive at Dogwood Drive. Crossing Mount Juliet Road, the tornado severely damaged West Wilson Middle School and Stoner Creek Elementary School, both of which will have to be torn down and rebuilt. The tornado reached its peak intensity of high-end EF-3 and peak size of 0.9 miles wide as it moved across Golden Bear Parkway and along Eastgate Blvd, leveling several large warehouses and killing a security guard at the CEVA warehouse on Athletes Way North. Crossing Highway 109 into Lebanon, the tornado weakened to EF-2 but continued damaging dozens of homes and businesses as it moved through southern sections of the city. Further to the east, buildings on both sides of I-40 in Tuckers Crossroads received up to EF-2 damage before the tornado turned southeast and crossed into Smith County. Weakening and shrinking in size, the tornado caused EF-1 damage to numerous homes and businesses in Grant, New Middleton, and just south of Gordonsville.

Total damage estimates from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency across Middle Tennessee reached $1.6 billion.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An historic, long-track, strong EF-3 tornado began in western Davidson County then tracked eastward for over 60 miles through Wilson County into Smith County before lifting, causing 5 deaths and 220 injuries. This tornado touched down west of River Road Pike then moved eastward across Bells Bend, destroying a barn and blowing down numerous trees. The tornado strengthened significantly and widened to 0.65 miles wide as it crossed the Cumberland River into the John C. Tune Airport area, causing strong EF-2 damage to numerous planes, hangers, warehouses, and other buildings from Cockrill Bend Way to Briley Parkway. Around $200 million in damage was reported at John Tune Airport alone. Continuing eastward, the tornado caused severe damage to the Tennessee State Prison and blew down numerous high-tension transmission towers as it again crossed the Cumberland River into North Nashville, with up to EF-2 damage to farm facilities at Tennessee State University and dozens of homes between I-40 and Buchanan Street. EF-2 damage continued across the Germantown neighborhood just 1/2 mile north of downtown Nashville with several damaged and destroyed apartment complexes, homes, and businesses. The tornado intensified further as it tracked through East Nashville, with EF-3 damage to businesses and other buildings in the Five Points area and EF-2 damage to homes in the Lockeland Springs and Barclay Drive neighborhoods. Two people were killed in Five Points after leaving a bar and going outside as the tornado struck. After crossing the Cumberland River yet again, the tornado weakened as it moved northeast through the Donelson Hills and Lincoya Hills neighborhoods of Donelson, but strengthened again to a strong EF-3 in the Standford Estates area where several homes were leveled. The tornado weakened slightly but continued to cause EF-2 damage to homes and businesses as it turned southeast and passed through Hermitage into Wilson County. ||Dozens of homes continued to sustain up to EF-2 damage as the tornado moved across the Chandler Road and Triple Crown Parkway neighborhoods of Mount Juliet. Turning more to the northeast, the tornado strenghtened to strong EF-3 and leveled numerous homes in the Catalpa Drive and Clearview Drive neighborhoods, with one elderly couple killed on Catalpa Drive at Dogwood Drive. Crossing Mount Juliet Road, the tornado severely damaged West Wilson Middle School and Stoner Creek Elementary School, both of which will have to be torn down and rebuilt. The tornado reached its peak intensity of high-end EF-3 and peak size of 0.9 miles wide as it moved across Golden Bear Parkway and along Eastgate Blvd, leveling several large warehouses and killing a security guard at the CEVA warehouse on Athletes Way North. Crossing Highway 109 into Lebanon, the tornado weakened to EF-2 but continued damaging dozens of homes and businesses as it moved through southern sections of the city. Further to the east, buildings on both sides of I-40 in Tuckers Crossroads received up to EF-2 damage before the tornado turned southeast and crossed into Smith County. Weakening and shrinking in size, the tornado caused EF-1 damage to numerous homes and businesses in Grant, New Middleton, and just south of Gordonsville. The tornado finally lifted east of Highway 141 and north of Judkins Lane after a continuous 60.13 miles on the ground.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 409.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A home had an outbuilding completely destroyed and a barn was destroyed as well.  The tornado continued further into Quitman County eventually crossing HWY 82 where several trees were downed including one that crushed a mobile home.  A man in the mobile home was transported to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Damage, consisting of snapped and uprooted trees continued to the east northeast through eastern Quitman County into Randolph County. The last accessible damage was along HWY 27 six miles north of Cuthbert where a few dozen pine trees were snapped and other trees were uprooted. The tornado continued into inaccessible areas further east at this point.  The tornado was rated EF1 was max winds estimated at 100 mph for both Quitman and Randolph counties.

Some supercells and bowing line segments were embedded within the large area of convection through the evening hours. A significant tornado occurred in southwest Indiana, along with isolated damaging winds. The atmosphere was only marginally unstable, with surface-based capes around 1000. Strong wind shear was favorable for the organized storm structures, including a few supercells.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado crossed the Ohio River from Henderson County, Kentucky into Newburgh. Five homes lost at least portions of their roof, and at least one home lost some of its second story walls. Dozens of other homes received moderate to major damage, including several with fallen trees causing major damage. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted. Dozens of small buildings, garages, and other small structures were damaged. Many power lines were either blown down or brought down by fallen trees. At least two people were treated and released from area hospitals. The tornado was photographed near the beginning of its track along the Ohio River.

Ample wind energy also was present, which not only helped bring damaging winds with severe storms but also allowed for strong gradient winds to occur ahead of an eastward advancing squall line. Severe weather occurred in the early morning hours of January 11th and continued across the ArkLaMiss region before noon, resulting in widespread wind damage as well as some tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado began on the southeast side of the Lake Village Municipal Airport on Airport Road where it rolled and almost destroyed a manufactured home. It is at Airport Road where one injury was reported due to a tree falling on a home. It then moved east-northeast to US Highway 278, breaking 8 to 10 wooden electrical poles. It moved to the northeast of the Lake Village community where it continued to knock down wooden electrical poles and began to uproot and snap large branches from softwood trees along North Lakeshore Drive and along the shore of Lake Chicot. The Lake Village Country Club along North Lakeshore Drive took damage to its roof on the backside. In addition, on the backside of the Country Club, a nearby forested area had multiple snapped large hardwood tree limbs in addition to the tin roof of a metal storage building peeled completely off. Also along North Lakeshore Drive, multiple trees were uprooted and snapped at a trailer park, where one trailer was blown across the street to near the bottom of Lake Chicot. As the tornado continued to track northeast, it moved along AR Highway 144, uprooting trees and snapping large hardwood limbs. Five electrical power poles were downed along Highway 144, as well as another trailer getting rolled to near the bottom of Lake Chicot.  The tornado continued to snap large limbs and uproot hardwood trees as it moved across Pecan Ridge Drive. The tornado continued to just north of Levee Road where it lifted, but not before a few uprooting hardwood trees and snapping small to medium sized limbs. It is important to note that a large swath of severe wind speeds resulted in widespread downed trees on Lakehall Road, Sunnyside Road, Stuart Island Road and at the Lake Chicot State Park. Several of these trees fell on power lines causing outages to a large portion of the Lake Village community. This tornado then continued east-northeast across the MS River to across Lake Ferguson in Washington County, where the second floor was blown off of a lake house on South Ferguson Road. In addition, a high concentration of snapped and uprooted hardwood trees was noted on the backside of the lakehouse on South Ferguson Road, thus resulting in the upgraded EF-2 rating. It continued to move east to Highway 1 North where it snapped small to large hardwood tree limbs before dissipating. Estimated peak wind with this tornado was 127 mph. Max width was 850 yards. Total path length was 17.81 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Severe weather occurred in the early morning hours of January 11th and continued across the ArkLaMiss region before noon, resulting in widespread wind damage as well as some tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado began on the southeast side of the Lake Village Municipal Airport on Airport Road where it rolled and almost destroyed a manufactured home. It is at Airport Road where one injury was reported due to a tree falling on a home. It then moved east-northeast to US Highway 278, breaking 8 to 10 wooden electrical poles. It moved to the northeast of the Lake Village community where it continued to knock down wooden electrical poles and began to uproot and snap large branches from softwood trees along North Lakeshore Drive and along the shore of Lake Chicot. The Lake Village Country Club along North Lakeshore Drive took damage to its roof on the backside. In addition, on the backside of the Country Club, a nearby forested area had multiple snapped large hardwood tree limbs in addition to the tin roof of a metal storage building peeled completely off. Also along North Lakeshore Drive, multiple trees were uprooted and snapped at a trailer park, where one trailer was blown across the street to near the bottom of Lake Chicot. As the tornado continued to track northeast, it moved along AR Highway 144, uprooting trees and snapping large hardwood limbs. Five electrical power poles were downed along Highway 144, as well as another trailer getting rolled to near the bottom of Lake Chicot.  The tornado continued to snap large limbs and uproot hardwood trees as it moved across Pecan Ridge Drive. The tornado continued to just north of Levee Road where it lifted, but not before a few uprooting hardwood trees and snapping small to medium sized limbs. It is important to note that a large swath of severe wind speeds resulted in widespread downed trees on Lakehall Road, Sunnyside Road, Stuart Island Road and at the Lake Chicot State Park. Several of these trees fell on power lines causing outages to a large portion of the Lake Village community. This tornado then continued east-northeast across the MS River to across Lake Ferguson in Washington County, where the second floor was blown off of a lake house on South Ferguson Road. In addition, a high concentration of snapped and uprooted hardwood trees was noted on the backside of the lakehouse on South Ferguson Road, thus resulting in the upgraded EF-2 rating. It continued to move east to Highway 1 North where it snapped small to large hardwood tree limbs before dissipating. Estimated peak wind with this tornado was 127 mph. Max width was 850 yards. Total path length was 17.81 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado then crossed Highway 1, where it destroyed some large grain bins and snapped numerous power poles. The tornado proceeded into the Dahomey National Wildlife Refuge where it knocked down trees and power poles. The most substantial damage was noted as the tornado crossed Highway 8 between Pace and Cleveland. It snapped more than 40 wooden power poles along Highway 8. The tornado uprooted and snapped trees and damaged some well built homes in the area northwest of Cleveland. This is also the area where the tornado snapped several concrete power poles. Several mobile homes were destroyed along South Bayou Road, injuring three people. More mobile homes were destroyed on McCain Road, injuring one person. The tornado proceeded to cross US 61 where it snapped more power poles and damaged homes near Tolliver Road. It also damaged some steel power trusses and a business along US 61 in Renova.

Meanwhile, a strong upper level low opened up into a trough as it entered the Southern Plains during the evening of the 11th, with large scale forcing ahead of the trough enhancing shower and thunderstorm development across much of West-central, Central, East and Southeast Texas during the evening through the early morning hours. Given the extent of shear, instability, and upper level forcing in place across the warm sector, numerous showers and thunderstorms developed over these areas, which quickly spread east northeast into East Texas around and shortly after daybreak on the 12th, and into North Louisiana during the mid and late morning hours. Some of these storms were severe, producing numerous reports of damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes. In all, nine tornadoes touched down across North Louisiana, including two EF-3 tornadoes with estimated maximum winds near 140 mph which tore through the southern sections of West Monroe through Central and Eastern Monroe, as well as just southwest of Sterlington in Northern Ouachita Parish. ||While there was a lull in the thunderstorms during much of the afternoon, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed across portions of Northeast Texas well behind the dry line which had mixed east to near Texarkana into Western Louisiana, and near the center of the upper level trough. Steep lapse rates aloft and the drier low level air mass contributed to areas of damaging winds and isolated instances of large hail, with the majority of the wind damage from a collapsing thunderstorm which originated just east of Dallas, and quickly moved east along the I-20 corridor in East Texas into Western Louisiana. Aided by strong pressure rises behind an associated cold front, a large swath of damaging winds were noted with the severe gust front, with gusts ranging from 50-70 mph well ahead of the collapsed storm. This resulted in numerous reports of downed trees and power lines across East Texas and Western Louisiana, with AEP Swepco noting that over 64,000 customers were without power at one time in the aftermath of the storms. These damaging winds diminished across Western Louisiana by mid-evening.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF-2 tornado with estimated maximum winds around 125 mph touched down along Adams Road and downed hundreds of trees as it crossed Simpton Road, Myrtle Hill Road, and Willie X Road. Along Willie X Road, it damaged the shingles of three single family homes and a church. As the tornado crossed Highway 5, it strengthened and completely destroyed three single wide manufactured homes, ripped the roof off and collapsed the walls of two homes, shifted a portion of a home off its foundation while ripping its roof off, and then damaged an exterior wall and a carport in addition to ripping portions of the roof off of a fourth home. One of the manufactured homes destroyed had five residents inside when the tornado struck, and all five survived, with only one of the five injured while the others only experienced minor bumps and bruises. The tornado went on to destroy the fourth single wide manufactured home and damage the roofs of two additional homes along Fuller Lane. The tornado continued to snap and uproot several trees just off of Scott Road and damaged shingles to homes off of Pin Oak Flat Road and Berry Lane. The tornado went on to uproot and snap trees as it crossed Highway 175 and Interstate 49 just south of the Frierson exit. After downing additional trees, the tornado lifted near Friendship Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado quickly intensified and caused EF2 damage near the intersection of Caraway Rd. and Race St. The tornado weakened slightly, but produced EF2 damage again at the Mall at Turtle Creek. The tornado reached its most intense stage as it approached and moved across the Jonesboro Airport. Several large industrial buildings were severely damaged. As the tornado moved through residential areas northeast of the airport, it caused EF2 to isolated EF3 damage to homes.

As the cold front tracked eastward storms developed across central and eastern Arkansas during the late afternoon of March 28, 2020. Increasing instability combined with a good deal of wind shear led to the development of supercells across eastern Arkansas along with a strong tornado near Jonesboro, Arkansas, and another weaker tornado in Greene County, Arkansas. Supercells eventually formed into a line along the Mississippi River and then moved across the remainder of the Mid-South producing wind damage and large hail.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado developed just north of I-555 and west of Caraway Road. The tornado quickly intensified and caused EF2 damage near the intersection of Caraway Rd. and Race St. The tornado weakened slightly, but produced EF2 damage again at the Mall at Turtle Creek. The tornado reached its most intense stage as it approached and moved across the Jonesboro Airport. Several large industrial buildings were severely damaged. As the tornado moved through residential areas northeast of the airport, it caused EF2 to isolated EF3 damage to homes. The tornado began weakening after it crossed Highway 49 northeast of Jonesboro, with the final damage observed to the northeast of Brookland. Peak winds were estimated at 150 mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

For historical context, this was the deadliest single tornado for the NWS Houston-Galveston forecast area since Nov 15th, 1987 when a tornado also killed three in Madison County.

The tornado touched down along Mitchell Bridge Road, just northwest of the Indian Trace Golf Course where several trees were snapped. The tornado moved northeast crossing Highway 286 and Twin Lakes Road where a few trees were snapped or uprooted and|minor damage occurred to several homes. The tornado appeared to briefly strengthen around Ellis Circle where there was more notable exterior damage to homes and a greater number of trees uprooted. As the tornado continued northeast crossing Fullers Chapel Road, noticeable strengthening occurred. Aerial drone footage showed a wide swath of large trees blown down just before Norton Bridge Road. At least 8 double-wide manufactured homes were completely destroyed along Deer Park Drive, with several others sustaining some degree of damage. It was here the tornado quickly strengthened to EF2 intensity with winds around 125 MPH. Similar, significant, damage was seen along Ridgeview Lane and Fieldview Court, where additional manufactured homes were destroyed and a recently built cell tower was left crumpled by the intense winds. At this point, the tornado reached its peak intensity with maximum wind speeds around 135 MPH. The tornado maintained its EF2 intensity as it crossed over Zion Church Hill Road, just before Highway 225. As the strong tornado crossed Highway 225, a small single-family home was heavily damaged with just a couple of interior walls left standing. Along Jim Petty Road, 4 large chicken houses were damaged or destroyed with the debris thrown several hundred yards away.  Further north along Jim Petty Road, near Hawkins Road, the damage appeared to lessen quickly with just a few trees blown down and minor roof damage to a shed. Some additional damage, mainly trees being snapped or uprooted, was seen along Halls Chapel Road, just before Temple Grove road. The tornado lifted just beyond this point, along Sumac Ridge.

It continued to track north for roughly 0.6 miles, damaging a tree grove and fence line.  The track then turned west northwest and crossed South Dakota Highway 45, roughly 0.2 miles south of 184th street.  A southbound RV pulling an enclosed trailer was struck. The trailer detached from the RV and the RV was lofted and rolled roughly 200 yards into a corn field on the west side of of South Dakota Highway 45.  The driver was pronounced dead at the scene.  The tornado track continued west northwest through the corn field for an estimated 0.4 miles.  The tornado was at its peak width and intensity at this point.  Corn was completely flattened  in some areas with a distinct convergent pattern.  As the tornado weakened and roped out the path took a southwest turn and persisted for roughly another 0.6 miles before coming to an end in the corn field.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado began along CR 286 south of Pachuta and tracked north northeastward across CR 289, CR 288, MS 18/512, CR 310, CR 3102, CR 130, and CR 320 snapping and uprooting several trees and causing minor damage to a few homes. The tornado then strengthened, with an increase in swaths of tree damage noted on satellite between Pachuta and Stonewall. The tornado reached EF2 strength on the west side of Stonewall along CR 320. In this area, a mobile home was destroyed, a wall of a church was collapsed, and several trees were snapped. The tornado continued north northeastward, heavily damaging the roof of a house as it crossed MS Highway 513.

A supercell thunderstorm developed and moved across portions of the Pine Belt and brought a violent tornado across the region, for the second time in as many weeks.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This violent tornado began over southeastern Walthall County in a field just west of Reagan Road and moved east northeastward along MS Highway 48, producing significant tree damage and minor damage to a few homes. It crossed into Marion County near the intersection of MS Highway 48 and Mt Bethel Road. The tornado then began to move more northeastward as it moved into southwestern Marion County, uprooting and snapping several softwood trees, causing minor roof damage to a home, and destroying an outdoor small shed along New Hope Road. It also snapped several trees and peeled the tin roof of a barn along A Pittman, Marks and Davis Roads. The tornado intensified relatively quickly once it moved northeast, snapping the majority of trees close to the ground in a wooded area east of New Hope Road. The basis for the low-end EF4 rating was a home on Johnson Road that was completely destroyed with its debris pushed to a corner of the foundation leaving residual vinyl flooring and a few of its anchor bolts bent. Furthermore, across the street from the aforementioned home, in a field a few of the snapped trees sustained patchy debarking. A higher rating was not assigned because the contents of the home were not spread a significant distance from the foundation and debris remained over a part of the slab. Nonetheless, significant damage to the home and nearby trees occurred. In addition, multiple wooden power poles were snapped, several other homes had significant roof damage and multiple mobile homes were completely destroyed, resulting in one fatality. Continual uprooting and snapping of trees was observed at Hurricane Creek Road, in addition to minor roof damage to a shed and a one-story home. When the tornado crossed Hurricane Creek Church Road, it caused significant roof damage to the Hurricane Creek Baptist Church and the nearby pastor's home. Behind the pastor's home was a large 40-foot shed that sat partially on cinder blocks and partially on a slab that was bolted down. This shed was completely destroyed as it was blown a few feet away. Several headstones in a cemetery were knocked over at this location as well. Additional roof damage to multiple homes and the uprooting and snapping of numerous trees along Hurricane Creek Road to the intersection of MS Highway 35. When the tornado reached MS Highway 35, it snapped multiple wooden power-poles and continued snapping trees. It continued east- northeast to Old MS Highway 35 causing numerous snapping of hardwood trees and the removal of a portion of a one-story home roof. The tornado continued moving east-northeast across the Pearl River bottom, when it reached MS Highway 43, multiple wooden power-poles were snapped, some minor roof damage occurred to some one-story homes and hardwood trees were snapped. Just east of MS Highway 43 along Joe Magee Road, a brick home sustained significant damage as the roof was completely destroyed and a few exterior walls were collapsed. A swath of snapped softwood trees was noted along Abrams Road thus producing EF2 damage.||Once the tornado reached MS Highway 13 and surrounding streets such as Pine Burr Road and Firetower Road near the Marion and Lamar county borders, a slight decline in strength was noted, though its path remained wide. Although, it was still snapping large tree limbs and snapping and uprooting some softwood trees, several of which fell onto wooden power poles and caused them to fall. The tornado maintained its east northeastward track, knocking thousands of trees down along with numerous power lines and poles down across the western portions of Lamar County. This tree damage was consistent with high end EF1 winds peaking between 100-110 mph. Around a dozen homes were damaged starting from Luther Saucier Rd to Purvis to Columbia Road, including one old mobile home that was completely destroyed. As the tornado continued to track east northeastward to the north of Purvis. It crossed Purvis Oloh Road, MS Highway 589 along with US 11. Hundreds of trees were damaged along with many power lines down. Some minor damage occurred to some homes. The tornado was slightly weaker here with winds between 90- 100mph. The tornado crossed I-59 into Forrest County along Ford and Elks Lodge Road in the Dixie community. Hundreds of trees were damaged along with many power lines down. Sheds and several homes had minor damage and one mobile home had the roof blown off. The tornado then crossed US 49 a couple miles north of Southgate Road. The tornado proceeded into Camp Shelby. At Camp Shelby, there were widespread snapped and uprooted trees. Multiple structures across the north half, in and around Lee Avenue to Glenn Walker Lake, had varying degrees of minor to moderate roof damage from the tornado or fallen trees. The park and camper area on the north end of the lake was impacted. One person was injured here as a large tree fell on a truck. The tornado then crossed over US 98 just west of the Perry County line. It continued into Perry County along the Leaf River bottom, snapping and uprooting trees. It continued to track just south of Old River Road before dissipating along Old River Road three miles northwest of New Augusta. Total path length was 53.76 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 400.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This violent, deadly tornado traveled 68 miles through parts of five counties including southeastern Jefferson Davis, central Covington, northwestern Jones, southeastern Jasper, and western Clarke counties. Locations impacted by this tornado include Bassfield, the areas between Collins and Seminary, Soso, Moss, Heidelberg, and Pachuta. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF4 with an estimated peak wind of 190 MPH east of Bassfield in southwestern Jefferson Davis County. Additional EF4 damage was noted near Soso in Jones County and at Moss in Jasper County. The maximum path width was 2.25 miles in the vicinity of Hughes Road west of Seminary in western Covington County. At this width, the tornado ranks 3rd widest in the official NOAA United States tornado database behind the El Reno, OK tornado of 2013 (2.6 mi) and the Hallam, NE tornado of 2004 (2.5 mi). This tornado now ranks as the widest on record in the state of Mississippi, surpassing the Yazoo City, MS tornado of 2010 (1.75 mi). Eight lives were lost in this tornado, and there was an undetermined number of additional injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado began south of Bassfield along Bassfield Cemetery Road, uprooting trees and resulting in relatively minor structural damage. As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.|| ||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.|| ||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.|| ||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of the tornado was 190mph, while the maximum wind speed in Covington County was 170mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.90M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This violent, deadly tornado traveled 68 miles through parts of five counties including southeastern Jefferson Davis, central Covington, northwestern Jones, southeastern Jasper, and western Clarke counties. Locations impacted by this tornado include Bassfield, the areas between Collins and Seminary, Soso, Moss, Heidelberg, and Pachuta. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF4 with an estimated peak wind of 190 MPH east of Bassfield in southwestern Jefferson Davis County. Additional EF4 damage was noted near Soso in Jones County and at Moss in Jasper County. The maximum path width was 2.25 miles in the vicinity of Hughes Road west of Seminary in western Covington County. At this width, the tornado ranks 3rd widest in the official NOAA United States tornado database behind the El Reno, OK tornado of 2013 (2.6 mi) and the Hallam, NE tornado of 2004 (2.5 mi). This tornado now ranks as the widest on record in the state of Mississippi, surpassing the Yazoo City, MS tornado of 2010 (1.75 mi). Eight lives were lost in this tornado, and there was an undetermined number of additional injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado began south of Bassfield along Bassfield Cemetery Road, uprooting trees and resulting in relatively minor structural damage. As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.|| ||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.|| ||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.|| ||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of the tornado was 190mph, while the maximum wind speed in Covington County was 170mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.90M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Some of the communities impacted include Oak Vale, the area north of Carson, the north side of Collins, Hot Coffee, Summerland, Stringer, and the west side of Paulding. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF3 with an estimated peak wind of 150 MPH near MS Highway 35 northeast of Carson in Jefferson Davis County. The maximum path width was 1.16 miles also near MS Highway 35 in Jefferson Davis County. No fatalities were reported in this tornado, but there was an undetermined number of injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado initially touched down in southeastern Lawrence County 11 miles south of the city of Monticello, causing minor tree damage. The tornado quickly strengthened as it took a northeast track, producing EF1 and EF2 tree damage along Givens Road and Divide Road. From an elevated location on Divide Road, surveyors were able to view extensive tree damage and ground scouring in the inaccessible Pearl River bottom in Lawrence County. This damage was also confirmed by satellite imagery. The tornado destroyed the roof of a home and completely destroyed a metal building structure on Rayborn Lane. The homeowner also stated that a well built log cabin that he owned along the Pearl River was completely destroyed. After crossing the Pearl River, the tornado proceeded to impact areas just east of the river, causing more significant tree damage along River Road and Coon Hunting Road. The tornado completely destroyed several chicken houses and significantly damaged two homes near MS Highway 43 before crossing into Jefferson Davis County. Once in Jefferson Davis County, the tornado snapped and uprooted numerous trees along Johnson Road, Palestine Road, and Lily Rose Road. The tornado crossed MS Highway 13 snapping a couple of wooden power poles and causing damage to large sections of the roof of a one- story home. Two mobile homes were destroyed along Greens Creek Road, with additional roof damage to homes as well as snapping and uprooting trees as the tornado progressed northeastward. A mobile home was destroyed along Newman Camp Road.|| ||The intensity of the tornado briefly increased to low end EF3 damage as it moved across Kirkley Lane, where extensive tree damage was noted. Damage to roofs, and the snapping and uprooting of trees continued as the tornado moved northeast. Large sections of a roof were removed from a one-story home on Haynes Gray Road, most walls of an apparently abandoned home were collapsed on SJ Garner Road, and the roof of a well built home was removed along Ross McPhail Road. Along Berry Loop, a mobile home was demolished and several other homes were heavily damaged.|| ||As the tornado neared MS Highway 35 and the Terrell community, it grew wider and stronger. Extensive tree damage and varying degrees of damage occurred to dozens of structures. In this area, multiple mobile homes were completely destroyed on both sides of the highway. A large church made of cinderblocks was leveled here and supportive of EF3 wind speeds near 150 mph. Multiple power lines were downed as well. The tornado reached its widest point in this location at 1.16 miles. EF3 tree damage continued as it crossed East Granby Road near the river as well as a small section when it crossed Three Notch Road. Several mobile homes were destroyed here as well. The tornado weakened a bit after this point, but remained strong as it crossed US 84 and neared US 49. A wide swath of extensive tree damage and downed power lines occurred along the path. A set of chicken houses west of Campbell Faler Road was destroyed, and a mobile home was rolled. As the tornado crossed Old Macintosh and Sunset Roads, more trees were downed along with some damage to structures. After crossing US 49, this strong tornado continued northeast where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted and a mobile home was destroyed on Hambone Road.|| ||The tornado continued across northeastern Covington County, crossing MS Highway 532 west of Hot Coffee, causing widespread tree damage and minor roof damage to some residential areas before crossing out of the county. The tornado then moved into northwest Jones and southern Smith County and crossed through the community of Summerland. Widespread tree damage continued through here, with some minor roof damage to residences, which was consistent with high end EF1 damage. A church along Smith County Road 8A had a steeple removed by the winds. The tornado then moved into southwestern Jasper County into the Stringer community. High end EF1 damage occurred in the area, with numerous trees snapped and uprooted in addition to a snapped power pole east of the community. Even though the circulation began to weaken, the tornado continued northeast and produced high end EF1 damage throughout central Jasper County before moving across the western side of Paulding. The tornado weakened in this area, still producing widespread EF0-EF1 tree damage as it crossed MS Highway 503 north of Paulding. The tornado lifted shortly thereafter along County Road 31. The maximum wind speed was 150mph in Jefferson Davis County, but was 140mph in Covington County. The total path length was 83.22 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8.30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

After crossing US 49, this strong tornado continued northeast where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted and a mobile home was destroyed on Hambone Road.|| ||The tornado continued across northeastern Covington County, crossing MS Highway 532 west of Hot Coffee, causing widespread tree damage and minor roof damage to some residential areas before crossing out of the county. The tornado then moved into northwest Jones and southern Smith County and crossed through the community of Summerland. Widespread tree damage continued through here, with some minor roof damage to residences, which was consistent with high end EF1 damage. A church along Smith County Road 8A had a steeple removed by the winds. The tornado then moved into southwestern Jasper County into the Stringer community. High end EF1 damage occurred in the area, with numerous trees snapped and uprooted in addition to a snapped power pole east of the community. Even though the circulation began to weaken, the tornado continued northeast and produced high end EF1 damage throughout central Jasper County before moving across the western side of Paulding. The tornado weakened in this area, still producing widespread EF0-EF1 tree damage as it crossed MS Highway 503 north of Paulding. The tornado lifted shortly thereafter along County Road 31. The maximum wind speed was 150mph in Jefferson Davis County, but was 140mph in Covington County. The total path length was 83.22 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8.30M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This violent, deadly tornado traveled 68 miles through parts of five counties including southeastern Jefferson Davis, central Covington, northwestern Jones, southeastern Jasper, and western Clarke counties. Locations impacted by this tornado include Bassfield, the areas between Collins and Seminary, Soso, Moss, Heidelberg, and Pachuta. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF4 with an estimated peak wind of 190 MPH east of Bassfield in southwestern Jefferson Davis County. Additional EF4 damage was noted near Soso in Jones County and at Moss in Jasper County. The maximum path width was 2.25 miles in the vicinity of Hughes Road west of Seminary in western Covington County. At this width, the tornado ranks 3rd widest in the official NOAA United States tornado database behind the El Reno, OK tornado of 2013 (2.6 mi) and the Hallam, NE tornado of 2004 (2.5 mi). This tornado now ranks as the widest on record in the state of Mississippi, surpassing the Yazoo City, MS tornado of 2010 (1.75 mi). Eight lives were lost in this tornado, and there was an undetermined number of additional injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado began south of Bassfield along Bassfield Cemetery Road, uprooting trees and resulting in relatively minor structural damage. As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.|| ||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.|| ||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.|| ||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of both the tornado and in Jefferson Davis County was 190mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 18.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This violent, deadly tornado traveled 68 miles through parts of five counties including southeastern Jefferson Davis, central Covington, northwestern Jones, southeastern Jasper, and western Clarke counties. Locations impacted by this tornado include Bassfield, the areas between Collins and Seminary, Soso, Moss, Heidelberg, and Pachuta. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF4 with an estimated peak wind of 190 MPH east of Bassfield in southwestern Jefferson Davis County. Additional EF4 damage was noted near Soso in Jones County and at Moss in Jasper County. The maximum path width was 2.25 miles in the vicinity of Hughes Road west of Seminary in western Covington County. At this width, the tornado ranks 3rd widest in the official NOAA United States tornado database behind the El Reno, OK tornado of 2013 (2.6 mi) and the Hallam, NE tornado of 2004 (2.5 mi). This tornado now ranks as the widest on record in the state of Mississippi, surpassing the Yazoo City, MS tornado of 2010 (1.75 mi). Eight lives were lost in this tornado, and there was an undetermined number of additional injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|||The tornado began south of Bassfield along Bassfield Cemetery Road, uprooting trees and resulting in relatively minor structural damage. As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of the tornado was 190mph, while the maximum wind speed in Jasper County was 178mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.80M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally.

Some of the communities impacted include Oak Vale, the area north of Carson, the north side of Collins, Hot Coffee, Summerland, Stringer, and the west side of Paulding. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF3 with an estimated peak wind of 150 MPH near MS Highway 35 northeast of Carson in Jefferson Davis County. The maximum path width was 1.16 miles also near MS Highway 35 in Jefferson Davis County. No fatalities were reported in this tornado, but there was an undetermined number of injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado initially touched down in southeastern Lawrence County 11 miles south of the city of Monticello, causing minor tree damage. The tornado quickly strengthened as it took a northeast track, producing EF1 and EF2 tree damage along Givens Road and Divide Road. From an elevated location on Divide Road, surveyors were able to view extensive tree damage and ground scouring in the inaccessible Pearl River bottom in Lawrence County. This damage was also confirmed by satellite imagery. The tornado destroyed the roof of a home and completely destroyed a metal building structure on Rayborn Lane. The homeowner also stated that a well built log cabin that he owned along the Pearl River was completely destroyed. After crossing the Pearl River, the tornado proceeded to impact areas just east of the river, causing more significant tree damage along River Road and Coon Hunting Road. The tornado completely destroyed several chicken houses and significantly damaged two homes near MS Highway 43 before crossing into Jefferson Davis County. Once in Jefferson Davis County, the tornado snapped and uprooted numerous trees along Johnson Road, Palestine Road, and Lily Rose Road. The tornado crossed MS Highway 13 snapping a couple of wooden power poles and causing damage to large sections of the roof of a one- story home. Two mobile homes were destroyed along Greens Creek Road, with additional roof damage to homes as well as snapping and uprooting trees as the tornado progressed northeastward. A mobile home was destroyed along Newman Camp Road.|| ||The intensity of the tornado briefly increased to low end EF3 damage as it moved across Kirkley Lane, where extensive tree damage was noted. Damage to roofs, and the snapping and uprooting of trees continued as the tornado moved northeast. Large sections of a roof were removed from a one-story home on Haynes Gray Road, most walls of an apparently abandoned home were collapsed on SJ Garner Road, and the roof of a well built home was removed along Ross McPhail Road. Along Berry Loop, a mobile home was demolished and several other homes were heavily damaged.|| ||As the tornado neared MS Highway 35 and the Terrell community, it grew wider and stronger. Extensive tree damage and varying degrees of damage occurred to dozens of structures. In this area, multiple mobile homes were completely destroyed on both sides of the highway. A large church made of cinderblocks was leveled here and supportive of EF3 wind speeds near 150 mph. Multiple power lines were downed as well. The tornado reached its widest point in this location at 1.16 miles. EF3 tree damage continued as it crossed East Granby Road near the river as well as a small section when it crossed Three Notch Road. Several mobile homes were destroyed here as well. The tornado weakened a bit after this point, but remained strong as it crossed US 84 and neared US 49. A wide swath of extensive tree damage and downed power lines occurred along the path. A set of chicken houses west of Campbell Faler Road was destroyed, and a mobile home was rolled. As the tornado crossed Old Macintosh and Sunset Roads, more trees were downed along with some damage to structures. After crossing US 49, this strong tornado continued northeast where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted and a mobile home was destroyed on Hambone Road.|| ||The tornado continued across northeastern Covington County, crossing MS Highway 532 west of Hot Coffee, causing widespread tree damage and minor roof damage to some residential areas before crossing out of the county. The tornado then moved into northwest Jones and southern Smith County and crossed through the community of Summerland. Widespread tree damage continued through here, with some minor roof damage to residences, which was consistent with high end EF1 damage. A church along Smith County Road 8A had a steeple removed by the winds. The tornado then moved into southwestern Jasper County into the Stringer community. High end EF1 damage occurred in the area, with numerous trees snapped and uprooted in addition to a snapped power pole east of the community. Even though the circulation began to weaken, the tornado continued northeast and produced high end EF1 damage throughout central Jasper County before moving across the western side of Paulding. The tornado weakened in this area, still producing widespread EF0-EF1 tree damage as it crossed MS Highway 503 north of Paulding. The tornado lifted shortly thereafter along County Road 31.

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This strong tornado traveled over 84 miles through parts of six counties including southern Lawrence, central Jefferson Davis, northern Covington, far northwestern Jones, far southeastern Smith, and Jasper counties. Some of the communities impacted include Oak Vale, the area north of Carson, the north side of Collins, Hot Coffee, Summerland, Stringer, and the west side of Paulding. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF3 with an estimated peak wind of 150 MPH near MS Highway 35 northeast of Carson in Jefferson Davis County. The maximum path width was 1.16 miles also near MS Highway 35 in Jefferson Davis County. No fatalities were reported in this tornado, but there was an undetermined number of injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado initially touched down in southeastern Lawrence County 11 miles south of the city of Monticello, causing minor tree damage. The tornado quickly strengthened as it took a northeast track, producing EF1 and EF2 tree damage along Givens Road and Divide Road. From an elevated location on Divide Road, surveyors were able to view extensive tree damage and ground scouring in the inaccessible Pearl River bottom in Lawrence County. This damage was also confirmed by satellite imagery. The tornado destroyed the roof of a home and completely destroyed a metal building structure on Rayborn Lane. The homeowner also stated that a well built log cabin that he owned along the Pearl River was completely destroyed. After crossing the Pearl River, the tornado proceeded to impact areas just east of the river, causing more significant tree damage along River Road and Coon Hunting Road. The tornado completely destroyed several chicken houses and significantly damaged two homes near MS Highway 43 before crossing into Jefferson Davis County. Once in Jefferson Davis County, the tornado snapped and uprooted numerous trees along Johnson Road, Palestine Road, and Lily Rose Road. The tornado crossed MS Highway 13 snapping a couple of wooden power poles and causing damage to large sections of the roof of a one- story home. Two mobile homes were destroyed along Greens Creek Road, with additional roof damage to homes as well as snapping and uprooting trees as the tornado progressed northeastward. A mobile home was destroyed along Newman Camp Road.|| ||The intensity of the tornado briefly increased to low end EF3 damage as it moved across Kirkley Lane, where extensive tree damage was noted. Damage to roofs, and the snapping and uprooting of trees continued as the tornado moved northeast. Large sections of a roof were removed from a one-story home on Haynes Gray Road, most walls of an apparently abandoned home were collapsed on SJ Garner Road, and the roof of a well built home was removed along Ross McPhail Road. Along Berry Loop, a mobile home was demolished and several other homes were heavily damaged.|| ||As the tornado neared MS Highway 35 and the Terrell community, it grew wider and stronger. Extensive tree damage and varying degrees of damage occurred to dozens of structures. In this area, multiple mobile homes were completely destroyed on both sides of the highway. A large church made of cinderblocks was leveled here and supportive of EF3 wind speeds near 150 mph. Multiple power lines were downed as well. The tornado reached its widest point in this location at 1.16 miles. EF3 tree damage continued as it crossed East Granby Road near the river as well as a small section when it crossed Three Notch Road. Several mobile homes were destroyed here as well. The tornado weakened a bit after this point, but remained strong as it crossed US 84 and neared US 49. A wide swath of extensive tree damage and downed power lines occurred along the path. A set of chicken houses west of Campbell Faler Road was destroyed, and a mobile home was rolled. As the tornado crossed Old Macintosh and Sunset Roads, more trees were downed along with some damage to structures. After crossing US 49, this strong tornado continued northeast where numerous trees were snapped and uprooted and a mobile home was destroyed on Hambone Road.|| ||The tornado continued across northeastern Covington County, crossing MS Highway 532 west of Hot Coffee, causing widespread tree damage and minor roof damage to some residential areas before crossing out of the county. The tornado then moved into northwest Jones and southern Smith County and crossed through the community of Summerland. Widespread tree damage continued through here, with some minor roof damage to residences, which was consistent with high end EF1 damage. A church along Smith County Road 8A had a steeple removed by the winds. The tornado then moved into southwestern Jasper County into the Stringer community. High end EF1 damage occurred in the area, with numerous trees snapped and uprooted in addition to a snapped power pole east of the community. Even though the circulation began to weaken, the tornado continued northeast and produced high end EF1 damage throughout central Jasper County before moving across the western side of Paulding. The tornado weakened in this area, still producing widespread EF0-EF1 tree damage as it crossed MS Highway 503 north of Paulding. The tornado lifted shortly thereafter along County Road 31.

It quickly strengthened as it moved northeastward through the Hope area where it produced damage consistent with 115 mph winds. It also quickly grew in width and was roughly 1200 yd/0.67 mi wide in Walthall County by the time it approached Hwy 27. As it crossed Hwy 27 it continued to cause significant damage along East Sartinville Rd. The tornado was strongest as it approached James Ratcliff Rd. Two homes on this road were leveled, one being reduced to a slab. Consultation with subject matter experts including both engineers and experts in forensic tornado damage analysis supports raising the maximum intensity to 170 mph based on the house that was reduced to a slab and a large hard wood tree that was uprooted and tossed several feet from where it stood. The increased wind speed makes the tornado an EF-4 on the Enhanced Fujita scale. The other home that was leveled suffered damage consistent with a high end EF-3. While all walls were collapsed, there was no evidence of bolts that would have held the sill plates to the foundation. Thus, the wind speed for this particular damage is reduced slightly from the expected. As it continued to move northeastward, it continued snapping every tree near the center of its path. It also caused substantial damage to several small cinder block buildings, tore the roof off of a home and rolled a tied down single-wide manufactured home as it crossed East Sartinville Rd. From there it continued northeastward and tore the entire roof from a brick home just before moving into Lawrence County. It should be noted that from just southwest of James Ratcliff Rd through the remainder of the Walthall Co portion of the track, nearly every tree in the path of the tornado was snapped or uprooted.|| ||The tornado then moved into far southeast Lawrence County, where it began snapping large hardwood branches on JK Givens Road. The tornado started to strengthen as a large swath of broken and uprooted hardwood trees were noted farther along JK Givens Road. As the tornado moved east northeast to Tynes Ainsworth Road, it tossed and completely destroyed a mobile home, causing two fatalities. Concurrently, it also snapped numerous softwood and hardwood trees behind and around the mobile home. The snapping and uprooting of numerous softwood trees continued when it moved northeast across Felix Sartin Road, while also causing some shingles to be removed from a one-story residence. Swaths of snapped hardwood trees and the uproot of trees was noted at Holmes Road, where a few wooden power poles were also snapped. The tornado then trekked into northwest Marion County, causing the snapping of multiple softwood trees just north of Ranch Road. The tornado moved northeast to US Road 587 where it broke a few wooden power poles and continued snapping softwood trees. It continued along its east-northeast path impacting River Road and Cooper Road, and causing large softwood branches to snap and the snapping and uprooting of softwood trees. The uprooting of a few softwood trees was noted when the tornado reached Highway 13, though the amount of uprooted trees was not as impressive from earlier in its track, thus showing a declining in strength. The tornado moved northeast into Jefferson Davis County, resulting in the snapping of a few small softwood tree limbs at Raynes Road. The tornado lifted at Joe Dyess Road, but not before snapping a few small hardwood tree limbs.||The total path length of the tornado was 21.17 miles. Maximum width was 1.1 miles in Lawrence County. Maximum estimated wind speed for the tornado was 170mph, and rated an EF4. However the maximum estimated wind speed in Lawrence County was 140mph, which was rated an EF3.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 750.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low. This wave was a bit unique as there were not as many thunderstorms associated with the line of strong and damaging winds. However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This violent, deadly tornado traveled 68 miles through parts of five counties including southeastern Jefferson Davis, central Covington, northwestern Jones, southeastern Jasper, and western Clarke counties. Locations impacted by this tornado include Bassfield, the areas between Collins and Seminary, Soso, Moss, Heidelberg, and Pachuta. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF4 with an estimated peak wind of 190 MPH east of Bassfield in southwestern Jefferson Davis County. Additional EF4 damage was noted near Soso in Jones County and at Moss in Jasper County. The maximum path width was 2.25 miles in the vicinity of Hughes Road west of Seminary in western Covington County. At this width, the tornado ranks 3rd widest in the official NOAA United States tornado database behind the El Reno, OK tornado of 2013 (2.6 mi) and the Hallam, NE tornado of 2004 (2.5 mi). This tornado now ranks as the widest on record in the state of Mississippi, surpassing the Yazoo City, MS tornado of 2010 (1.75 mi). Eight lives were lost in this tornado, and there was an undetermined number of additional injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|||The tornado began south of Bassfield along Bassfield Cemetery Road, uprooting trees and resulting in relatively minor structural damage. As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of the tornado was 190mph, while the maximum wind speed in Clarke County was 104mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

However, this line of activity produced widespread wind damage across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and all of the northern half of Mississippi, including the Mississippi Delta where winds of 70 to 90 mph occurred. While many structures sustained some sort of damage, widespread trees and power lines were blown down during the late evening and early morning hours with the final wave.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This violent, deadly tornado traveled 68 miles through parts of five counties including southeastern Jefferson Davis, central Covington, northwestern Jones, southeastern Jasper, and western Clarke counties. Locations impacted by this tornado include Bassfield, the areas between Collins and Seminary, Soso, Moss, Heidelberg, and Pachuta. This tornado is preliminarily rated EF4 with an estimated peak wind of 190 MPH east of Bassfield in southwestern Jefferson Davis County. Additional EF4 damage was noted near Soso in Jones County and at Moss in Jasper County. The maximum path width was 2.25 miles in the vicinity of Hughes Road west of Seminary in western Covington County. At this width, the tornado ranks 3rd widest in the official NOAA United States tornado database behind the El Reno, OK tornado of 2013 (2.6 mi) and the Hallam, NE tornado of 2004 (2.5 mi). This tornado now ranks as the widest on record in the state of Mississippi, surpassing the Yazoo City, MS tornado of 2010 (1.75 mi). Eight lives were lost in this tornado, and there was an undetermined number of additional injuries. Additional details on the damage path and area of most significant damage follow.|| ||The tornado began south of Bassfield along Bassfield Cemetery Road, uprooting trees and resulting in relatively minor structural damage. As it proceeded northeastward, the diameter of the wind field steadily increased and the percentage of snapped trees in the center of the vortex increased considerably as the tornado approached MS Highway 42. At this location, two homes sustained major roof damage. Tornado intensity then began to increase quickly, with EF3 damage as it crossed Hosey Mikell Road, completely demolishing a mobile home and scattering the debris field over 300 yards downwind. Tree damage also ramped up significantly beyond this location, with low end EF4 damage in a narrow swath of nearly complete tree destruction along the center of the tornado vortex and increasing instances of debarking of trees as the tornado moved across Pitts Lane and Reese Road. Outside of this most intense corridor of tornadic winds, EF1 and EF2 damage to trees and structures was occurring over a wider area, up one mile wide. In addition, both ground surveys and aerial photography indicated the presence of multiple vortices at times. Intense damage continued as the tornado crossed the intersection of Graves Key Road and Harper Road, where a cinder block small business building was destroyed, with much of the slab swept clean. Four fatalities occurred at this location. Nearby, a mobile home was completely destroyed, with the undercarriage wrapped around the small set of trees that remained standing downwind. Debarking of some trees was again noted and continued along the tornado path across Claude Booth Road.|| ||The tornado reached its peak intensity as it moved across a field north of Graves Key Road. At this location, the foundation of a wood frame and metal roof cabin was swept clean. A truck parked at this cabin was tossed approximately 300 yards downwind, and trees that remained standing at this site were partially debarked. Though the path of the intense tornado vortex through the field surrounding this cabin was clearly visible, significant scouring was not noted. The tornado continued to remain violent and grow in size, nearly 1.5 miles wide, as it crossed Good Hope Road and continued to track toward the Bouie River. Here, a large swath of extreme tree damage was noted as the whole forest was leveled. An intense core of the tornado was evident by debarking of trees along a well defined center line or sub-vortex feature. Extreme debarking was noted around Willie Fortenberry Road. In this general area, several farmers reported roughly 60 cattle were killed by the tornado. The tornado grew larger as it entered Covington County and peaked in width in the vicinity of Hughes Road. Maximum width was measured at 2.25 miles. The incredible expansive tree damage continued along the path with millions of trees damaged. Several dozen structures were damaged or destroyed between McGowen Circle to US 49. Numerous chicken houses (23-30) were destroyed here as well. A section of Cold Springs Road looked to see another sub- vortex and it was here another area of EF4 damage occurred to a home.|| ||As the tornado crossed US 49, the width decreased to 1.7 miles, but it remained quite strong with mid to upper end EF3 damage noted. Extreme tree damage persisted in large swaths along the path. In addition, a few dozen structures were damaged between US 49 and MS Highway 588. This consisted of varying degrees of damage from EF1 to EF3 levels. The tornado entered northwestern Jones County near the Centerville community where several homes had shingles blown off or parts of the decking exposed. A mobile home along Tommy Pickering Road was thrown and separated from the frame, with the highest winds in the EF2 range. As the storm moved northeast across US 84, trees were uprooted and snapped. Several homes on both sides of the highway had decking exposed or shingles blown off. At least one mobile home was destroyed along US 84. The tornado intensified to an EF3 causing significant damage to multiple homes along Danny Hillburn Road, where large sections of roofing was removed. Between US 84 and MS Highway 29, several mobile homes were completely destroyed and at least one separated from the frame. Several homes had one or more exterior walls collapsed or large sections of the roof removed. The tornado continued to cause widespread destruction as it moved into the town of Soso. Several homes and churches received significant damage. Large swaths of trees were snapped and uprooted along MS Highway 29. Near the center of town, a fire station was heavily damaged when the overhead doors collapsed and portions of the roof were removed. Numerous homes had roofing removed and exposed decking. The worst damage occurred along MS Highway 28 where a convenience store was destroyed and several other cinder block structures were heavily damaged when the storm intensified to low end EF-4. The tornado continued to mow down large swaths of trees and caused major uplift and loss of roofing to numerous homes as it moved northeast toward MS Highway 15. Along Mathews Road numerous mobile homes and several outbuildings were completely destroyed.||The tornado intensified to a low end EF4 as it moved into the Moss community, where winds near 175 mph resulted in widespread devastation. Nearly every structure in the community was damaged with the most significant damage occurring along or near MS Highway 537. About half of the First Baptist Church of Moss was completely leveled. Numerous homes were destroyed or had major roofing loss or uplifted. A small pick-up truck was thrown several hundred yards and completely destroyed. In addition, multiple mobile homes were completely demolished.||As the storm tracked toward I-59 a few miles west of Heidelberg, hundreds of trees were mowed down, outbuildings were destroyed. Several homes and mobile homes had metal roofing peeled back or decking exposed. Large swaths of trees were snapped for several miles including some along I-59 between the Heidelberg and Vossburg exits. Swaths of tree damage continued into the Barnett community. In the town of Pachuta there was scattered tree damage and the metal roofing was peeled off of a church. About two miles north of Pachuta, the damage became sporadic and the tornado lifted in a wooded area along County Road 130.||The total path length was 67.43 miles. The maximum estimated wind speed of the tornado was 190mph, while the maximum wind speed in Jones County was 167mph.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 11.80M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was a multifaceted event with a few different waves of activity, each of which brought their own unique hazardous weather to the residents of the region. This outbreak had a total of 20 tornadoes across the NWS Jackson service area. Of these, two tornadoes were long tracked and in excess of 60 miles. Additionally, the most intense tornado was historically significant as it was the widest tornado in Mississippi history at 2.25 miles and ranks as the third widest nationally. Unfortunately, fatalities occurred across the region, most of which came from the two long track tornadoes. Total fatalities were 14, which were across several counties and almost 100 people were injured. Of the 20 tornadoes, two were rated as EF4, one was an  EF3, four were EF2, ten were EF1 and there were three EF0.||The first wave of severe storms moved out of northeast Louisiana as a line of thunderstorms or QLCS. The bowing segment of this line was efficient at producing tornadoes as it moved across northeast Louisiana parishes and through central sections of Mississippi before tracking across Alabama. This part of the QLCS produced 13 tornadoes across the service area with the strongest being three EF2s that occurred west of Pioneer LA, northwest of Yazoo City MS, and north of Macon MS.||The next wave was focused around two large supercell storms where each produced long track tornadoes, and were the phenomena that had the greatest impact across south and southeast Mississippi. The first storm produced two EF4 tornadoes, one of which was on the ground for 68 miles before dissipating. This tornado was up to two miles wide in several locations, with the maximum width at 2.25 miles making it the widest tornado in Mississippi history. On the heels of this supercell, another supercell developed and produced a long track EF3 tornado, which was on the ground for 84 miles.||The third and final wave was associated with the southeast surge of the cold front and driven by the strong lift and winds from the core of the upper level low.

The environment ahead of the QLCS was unusually unstable for this time of day and year, with gulf moisture spreading upper 60 F to near 70 F dewpoints into a warm sector across the Southeast United States and mid level lapse rates around 7 C/km helping produce mixed layer convective available potential energy (MLCAPE) as high as 2000 J/kg across Southeast South Carolina. Within the warm sector, very strong vertical shear associated with a 50 knot plus low and mid-level jet, effective bulk shear around 70 knots, effective storm relative helicity in the 400-600 m2/s2 range, and VAD wind profiles displaying large, curved low-level hodographs were supportive of well organized convection and potentially embedded supercell thunderstorms in a QLCS capable of producing a prolonged path of damaging winds and strong long-track tornadoes. As the QLCS swept through Southeast South Carolina, a few supercell thunderstorms became exceptionally strong while partially breaking away from the main line of thunderstorms, producing widespread wind damage and strong long-track tornadoes. ||A total of 13 confirmed tornadoes occurred across Southeast South Carolina, including a long track EF-4 tornado in Hampton County that took the lives of 5 people and injured 60 others along an approximately 24 mile path. The EF-4 tornado was the first to have occurred across Southeast South Carolina and the last to have occurred in the entire state of South Carolina since November 17, 1995, almost 25 years prior. This particular tornado was associated with a storm that produced a destructive path of straight-line wind damage and series of long track and intermittent tornadoes for over 150 miles, beginning in Screven County, Georgia, then continuing northeast across Hampton County, Colleton County, Dorchester County, and Berkeley County, South Carolina before leaving the area and eventually shifting offshore along the South Carolina coast. Two other storms were responsible for the remaining tornadoes across the area, most of which occurred from a single storm occurring across Edisto Island, Seabrook Island and Kiawah Island. Outside the EF-4 tornado in Hampton County, straight-line winds near a passing tornado claimed the life of one individual and injured one in Colleton County, while another tornado caused 6 injuries across Berkeley County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A National Weather Service Storm Survey Team confirmed an EF-4 tornado with an estimated maximum wind speed of 175 mph in central Hampton County. ||The tornado began just north of Collie Road, approximately 3 miles west-northwest of Scotia, South Carolina, snapping and uprooting trees and causing damage to the Federal Correctional Institution of Estill along its northeast track. The tornado then continued northeast, crossing over Highway 321 near the intersection with County Road S-25-35 before gaining strength and causing substantial damage. Beyond this point, the unusually long track and wide tornado damaged and destroyed many residences, including mobile and single family homes along its entire path. A few automobiles were also tossed/rolled 50 to 75 yards from their original locations. In addition, the tornado reached a maximum width of about 0.75 mile, causing extensive damage to thousands of trees and numerous power lines. At times, the damage pattern suggested that the tornado may have consisted of multiple vortices, which can occur in stronger tornadoes.||The most significant structural damage occurred just south of Estill, South Carolina and across Nixville, South Carolina, where at least six residences were destroyed. After crossing Highway 321 and continuing a northeast track, the tornado began producing EF-2 to EF-3 damage to residences along Sprayfield Road to Lena Expressway. The tornado then continued northeast where it completely destroyed a mobile home near the intersection of Highway 3 and Highway 601, tragically claiming the lives of 2 adult males. Continuing on a northeast track, the tornado heavily damaged homes near the intersection of Turner Expressway and Brandy Lane, including completely destroying a mobile home that tragically claimed the lives of 2 adult females and 1 adult male. The tornado then reached peak EF-4 intensity along Lento Road where the roof and all exterior/interior walls of a two story home were removed and dispersed across the yard. The tornado then began a weakening trend while tracking further northeast, eventually crossing Highway 278, Yemassee Highway and ending approximately 1 mile beyond the intersection of Old Salkehatchie Highway and Archie Road before the Hampton/Colleton County line. ||Overall, the tornado path stretched approximately 24 miles, claiming the lives of 5 individuals in the hardest hit areas just south of Estill, South Carolina and across Nixville, South Carolina. Additionally, 60 people sustained injuries associated with the tornado tracking through this hardest hit area, including a few individuals that were thrown 30 to 50 yards from mobile homes and individuals that were in homes that received EF-3 to EF-4 damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado touched down near the intersection of Knowles Lane and Middle Track Road. It then tracked to the north northwest and reached its strongest point just south of the town of Woodard as it crossed Morning Road, where its width increased to just over one third of a mile and it reached EF3 intensity. The tornado completely destroyed several mobile homes and stick built houses in this area. It flattened seven single-wide and double-wide mobile homes, leaving unrecognizable bits of debris. The fatalities and injuries occurred in the vicinity of Morning Road. The tornado weakened to EF1 intensity as it approached the west side of the town of Windsor, but it did damage a farm on Highway 306. The tornado then lifted just before reaching Governors Road about 2 miles northwest of Windsor.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong southerly return flow commenced out ahead of the trough during the 8th-9th, allowing for unseasonably warm and humid conditions to advance northward across Southern Oklahoma, much of Central and Eastern Texas, as well as Louisiana, Arkansas, and the Lower Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, an intensifying surface low pressure system and associated dry line developed along the Red River of North Texas into Southern Oklahoma during the afternoon hours, which spread east northeast across the Ark-La-Tex during the early morning hours on January 11th. With afternoon temperatures climbing into the mid 70s ahead of this trough, moderate instability developed across the broad warm sector, with very strong wind shear in place as large scale forcing increased ahead of the trough axis across East Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, and North Louisiana. Thus, an axis of strong to severe showers and thunderstorms developed during the evening hours across Southeast Oklahoma, adjacent sections of Southwest Arkansas and East Texas, which advanced east into North Louisiana during the early morning hours of the 11th. Damaging winds downed trees and power lines across portions of East Texas, with even multiple tornadoes touching down along the line of severe thunderstorms. Unfortunately, a man  was killed when a tornado touched down west of Nacogdoches and a tree fell on his mobile home. These storms also produced locally heavy rainfall, with amounts of one to three inches, with isolated higher amounts up to four inches recorded across much of this area, resulting in isolated instances of flash flooding. These storms continued to intensify during the late evening and early morning hours as they moved into extreme Eastern Texas and Western Louisiana, producing more in the way of widespread wind damage and isolated tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An EF-1 tornado with estimated maximum winds near 100 mph touched down just west of Highway 7 on the southwest side of Center and continued on an east-northeast path for roughly 6 miles. The tornado cut through a few neighborhoods on the south side of Center, where numerous trees were snapped or uprooted across the path through the town, resulting in roof and structural damage to many homes as trees fell through them. The most extensive damage occurred in the Lakewood subdivision just off of Highway 7, where one minor injury occurred as a fallen pine tree heavily damaged the roof of a home. In addition, a handful of other homes farther east along Ballard Street sustained significant damage from falling trees. There was also damage to homes farther east near Martin Luther King Drive, where a few homes sustained minor structural roof damage due to winds alone. On Loop 500 East on the southeast side of town, there was additional structural damage due to mainly wind, although a few of the damaged homes were likely vacant and already in a heavy state of disrepair before the tornado. It then continued into much more rural areas on the eastern outskirts of Center, resulting in scattered tree and very low-end structural damage until reaching County Road 3047. Here, a majority of the chicken houses had some of their roof paneling removed with a few of the houses having most of the roof paneling torn off along with additional structural damage. It was at this point where the most concentrated damage was found. The tornado then lifted shortly after crossing County Road 3047.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong southerly return flow commenced out ahead of the trough during the 8th-9th, allowing for unseasonably warm and humid conditions to advance northward across Southern Oklahoma, much of Central and Eastern Texas, as well as Louisiana, Arkansas, and the Lower Mississippi Valley.

It quickly strengthened as it moved northeastward through the Hope area where it produced damage consistent with 115 mph winds. It also quickly grew in width and was roughly 1200 yd/0.67 mi wide by the time it approached Hwy 27. As it crossed Hwy 27 it continued to cause significant damage along East Sartinville Rd. The tornado was strongest as it approached James Ratcliff Rd. Two homes on this road were leveled, one being reduced to a slab. Consultation with subject matter experts including both engineers and experts in forensic tornado damage  analysis supports raising the maximum intensity to 170 mph based  on the house that was reduced to a slab and a large hard wood tree that was uprooted and tossed several feet from where it stood. The increased wind speed makes the tornado an EF-4 on the Enhanced Fujita scale. The other home that was leveled suffered damage consistent with a high end EF-3. While all walls were collapsed, there was no evidence of bolts that would have held the sill plates to the foundation. Thus, the wind speed for this particular damage is reduced slightly from the expected. The tornado was also widest in this area, reaching a maximum width of around 1300 yards or approximately 0.75 miles. As it continued to move northeastward, it continued snapping every tree near the center of its path. It also caused substantial damage to several small cinder block buildings, tore the roof off of a home and rolled a tied down single-wide manufactured home as it crossed East Sartinville Rd. From there it continued northeastward and tore the entire roof from a brick home just before moving into Lawrence County. It should be noted that from just southwest of James Ratcliff Rd through the remainder of the Walthall Co portion of  the track, nearly every tree in the path of the tornado was snapped or uprooted. The tornado was responsible for two fatalities in Walthall County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado was also widest in this area, reaching a maximum width of around 1300 yards or approximately 0.75 miles. As it continued to move northeastward, it continued snapping every tree near the center of its path. It also caused substantial damage to several small cinder block buildings, tore the roof off of a home and rolled a tied down single-wide manufactured home as it crossed East Sartinville Rd. From there it continued northeastward and tore the entire roof from a brick home just before moving into Lawrence County. It should be noted that from just southwest of James Ratcliff Rd through the remainder of the Walthall Co portion of  the track, nearly every tree in the path of the tornado was snapped or uprooted. The tornado was responsible for two fatalities in Walthall County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Claudette was declared a Tropical Storm and made landfall in southeast Louisiana during the early morning hours of June 19th. Claudette then turned northeast across southeast Mississippi and across south central Alabama during the morning on Saturday June 19th.||Tropical Storm Claudette produced frequent tropical storm-force wind gusts across coastal Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle. A few areas of the coast, such as Dauphin Island, Fort Morgan, and the Okaloosa Island Fishing Pier recorded a brief period of sustained minimal tropical storm-force winds.||The highest wind gusts were associated with strong to severe thunderstorms that developed well east of the center of Claudette. These storms most significantly impacted the western Florida Panhandle. The highest wind gust observed was 81 mph at Pensacola International Airport. A Weatherflow site in Santa Rosa Sound recorded a 70 mph wind gust, which was from the same line of storms that resulted in the Pensacola gust. This line of storms produced wind damage in parts of the Pensacola Metro, especially in Ferry Pass. Pace also experienced pockets of wind damage, including one mobile home that lost its roof||The highest winds recorded were sustained winds of 45 mph with gusts to 70 mph in Santa Rosa Sound, 58 mph with gusts to 81 mph at Pensacola Airport, 42 mph with gusts to 52 mph at Okaloosa Island fishing pier. In Mobile Bay, 40 mph with gusts to 49 mph at Buccaneer Yacht Club.||Storm surge inundation ranged from 1-3 feet above normally dry ground across southern Mobile County into Mobile Bay. This flooding resulted in the closure of a few roads, such as Shell Belt Rd in the Bayou La Batre and Coden communities and the US Highway 90 Causeway over Mobile Bay. The highest storm tide recorded was 3.67 ft MHHW at the NOS tide gauge on the Bayou La Batre bridge. In addition to the storm surge, surf heights of 6-12 feet battered the Gulf facing beaches. This impacted the west end of Dauphin Island with a portion of Bienville Blvd closed due to flooding and sand over the road. The Florida side of the Gulf Islands National Seashore was closed for several days due to flooding and sand on roads. ||Claudette produced 3 tornadoes in southwest and south central Alabama: A long track EF-2 tornado that impacted Escambia and Conecuh Counties, an EF-0 tornado in rural Covington County, and an EF-0 tornado in far southern Mobile County.||A widespread 3-6 of rain fell across coastal Alabama into the western Florida Panhandle. 6-9 of rain was recorded over parts of interior southeast MS, with a station in far western Stone County, 11 miles west of Perkinston, recording 9.43. This rainfall resulted in instances of flash flooding and river flooding across the area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado first touched down on Jay Road just west of Highway 41 in Riverview. The tornado intensified and widened as it moved northeast into East Brewton, crossing over|Highway 41. During this time, the tornado produced EF-1 intensity damage to numerous trees, homes, businesses in the area. Some of the most severe damage was located at the intersection of Forrest Avenue and Andrew Jackson Street where several mobile homes were completely destroyed. This was rated as EF-2 intensity damage with peak estimated winds of 125-130 mph. There was also significant roof damage to the auditorium at W S Neal High School. The tornado continued northeast and moved across Shoffner Street.

Claudette was declared a Tropical Storm and made landfall in southeast Louisiana during the early morning hours of June 19th. Claudette then turned northeast across southeast Mississippi and across south central Alabama during the morning on Saturday June 19th.||Tropical Storm Claudette produced frequent tropical storm-force wind gusts across coastal Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle. A few areas of the coast, such as Dauphin Island, Fort Morgan, and the Okaloosa Island Fishing Pier recorded a brief period of sustained minimal tropical storm-force winds.||The highest wind gusts were associated with strong to severe thunderstorms that developed well east of the center of Claudette. These storms most significantly impacted the western Florida Panhandle. The highest wind gust observed was 81 mph at Pensacola International Airport. A Weatherflow site in Santa Rosa Sound recorded a 70 mph wind gust, which was from the same line of storms that resulted in the Pensacola gust. This line of storms produced wind damage in parts of the Pensacola Metro, especially in Ferry Pass. Pace also experienced pockets of wind damage, including one mobile home that lost its roof||The highest winds recorded were sustained winds of 45 mph with gusts to 70 mph in Santa Rosa Sound, 58 mph with gusts to 81 mph at Pensacola Airport, 42 mph with gusts to 52 mph at Okaloosa Island fishing pier. In Mobile Bay, 40 mph with gusts to 49 mph at Buccaneer Yacht Club.||Storm surge inundation ranged from 1-3 feet above normally dry ground across southern Mobile County into Mobile Bay. This flooding resulted in the closure of a few roads, such as Shell Belt Rd in the Bayou La Batre and Coden communities and the US Highway 90 Causeway over Mobile Bay. The highest storm tide recorded was 3.67 ft MHHW at the NOS tide gauge on the Bayou La Batre bridge. In addition to the storm surge, surf heights of 6-12 feet battered the Gulf facing beaches. This impacted the west end of Dauphin Island with a portion of Bienville Blvd closed due to flooding and sand over the road. The Florida side of the Gulf Islands National Seashore was closed for several days due to flooding and sand on roads. ||Claudette produced 3 tornadoes in southwest and south central Alabama: A long track EF-2 tornado that impacted Escambia and Conecuh Counties, an EF-0 tornado in rural Covington County, and an EF-0 tornado in far southern Mobile County.||A widespread 3-6 of rain fell across coastal Alabama into the western Florida Panhandle. 6-9 of rain was recorded over parts of interior southeast MS, with a station in far western Stone County, 11 miles west of Perkinston, recording 9.43. This rainfall resulted in instances of flash flooding and river flooding across the area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado first touched down on Jay Road just west of Highway 41 in Riverview. The tornado intensified and widened as it moved northeast into East Brewton, crossing over|Highway 41. During this time, the tornado produced EF-1 intensity damage to numerous trees, homes, businesses in the area. Some of the most severe damage was located at the intersection of Forrest Avenue and Andrew Jackson Street where several mobile homes were completely destroyed. This was rated as EF-2 intensity damage with peak estimated winds of 125-130 mph. There was also significant roof damage to the auditorium at W S Neal High School. The tornado continued northeast and moved across Shoffner Street. Primarily EF-1 intensity damage to trees and homes was noted here, but a swath of EF-2 intensity tree damage was noted in a valley just north of Ballard Street. Major tree damage continued north across Cook Road. Additional major structural damage was observed along Riddle Road near Horseshoe Road.

Strong upper atmospheric winds (energy) combined with unseasonably mild and humid air accounted for a line of thunderstorms to develop just east of Lake Ontario and move ENE across the Adirondacks into the southern Champlain Valley of NY/VT and then into central VT.||One particular thunderstorm in this line caused scattered wind damage from northern Lewis and northern Hamilton counties into Essex county before moving across Addison county where an EF1 tornado occurred just north of Middlebury and this same storm caused scattered wind damage in Montpelier, East Montpelier, Plainfield and northern Barre. ||Much of the damage was trees/limbs down along with utility lines but some structural damage to a flimsy, temporary tin roof in Plainfield due to thunderstorm winds and some significant damage to a home and barn structures due to an EF1 tornado in northern Middlebury.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado touched down just northeast of Juniper Lane causing limb|damage before throwing a barrel into a house and shattering a window.|As the tornado tracked northeastward, multiple softwood trees were|either uprooted or had snapped trunks. Once the tornado crossed|Painter Road, it forcibly removed an attached garage from a house,|caused a full collapse of the garage and did significant damage to the|shingled roof. A car was also flipped on its side at the residence.|As the tornado continued to move northeastward, it removed roofing from|multiple farm buildings and uprooted additional softwood trees. Once the|tornado moved northeast of the farm, it entered a field where it snapped|over a dozen additional trees at mid-trunk level before dissipating over|the field.

This was the same system responsible for the tornado outbreak across AL/MS/GA the previous day. Strong upper atmospheric winds (energy) combined with unseasonably mild and humid air accounted for a line of thunderstorms to develop just east of Lake Ontario and move ENE across the Adirondacks into the southern Champlain Valley of NY/VT and then into central VT.||One particular thunderstorm in this line caused scattered wind damage from northern Lewis and northern Hamilton counties into Essex county before moving across Addison county where an EF1 tornado occurred just north of Middlebury and this same storm caused scattered wind damage in Montpelier, East Montpelier, Plainfield and northern Barre. ||Much of the damage was trees/limbs down along with utility lines but some structural damage to a flimsy, temporary tin roof in Plainfield due to thunderstorm winds and some significant damage to a home and barn structures due to an EF1 tornado in northern Middlebury.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado touched down just northeast of Juniper Lane causing limb|damage before throwing a barrel into a house and shattering a window.|As the tornado tracked northeastward, multiple softwood trees were|either uprooted or had snapped trunks. Once the tornado crossed|Painter Road, it forcibly removed an attached garage from a house,|caused a full collapse of the garage and did significant damage to the|shingled roof. A car was also flipped on its side at the residence.|As the tornado continued to move northeastward, it removed roofing from|multiple farm buildings and uprooted additional softwood trees. Once the|tornado moved northeast of the farm, it entered a field where it snapped|over a dozen additional trees at mid-trunk level before dissipating over|the field. This tornado injured two people during the brief touchdown.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 75.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado began along Chapel Hills Parkway, where minor shingle damage occurred. The tornado tracked northeastward across Ellard Road and directly over the Walker Chapel Road overpass on Interstate 65. It was at this interstate exit where the tornado began to intensify rapidly, snapping numerous power poles and causing substantial damage to a hotel. The tornado continued northeastward, crossing Highway 31, causing mostly tree damage along the highway. As the tornado moved into residential areas along Fulton Drive and Lykes Boulevard, substantial damage occurred with several homes being destroyed with at least one being swept off the foundation. There was also significant tree damage in the neighborhood. Several homes along Georgetown Lane suffered significant damage as wind breached garage doors, aiding in complete roof loss in some cases. Other damage included destroyed fences, sheds, and lofting of a hot tub. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped.||As the tornado continued toward the northeast, it paralleled Carson Road and caused substantial damage to homes along Meida Circle, Darlene Drive, and New Castle Road. Buildings in an industrial area along Carson Road were damaged, including a fleet of vehicles at Hurst Towing. The damage along New Castle Road was widespread with a few trees debarked or snapped half way down the trunk, and debris from homes thrown considerable distances. The tornado began to weaken somewhat after crossing North Pine Hill Road, but still caused minor damage to the Fultondale High School and a wooded area to the east.  As it continued eastward crossing Indian Valley Road, several trees were uprooted and a few homes received minor damage.  Along Highway 79, dozens of mobile homes were damaged by falling trees in the Rusk Mobile Home Park. The tornado then crossed Highway 75 in Center Point, where trees and power lines were downed near the Jefferson County Multi-Services Facility. The tornado began to weaken further at this point, but still produced a narrow discernable track of EF0 damage just east of Center Point Lake, where trees were uprooted and minor roof and structural damage occurred. Nearing the end of its life cycle, the tornado turned northward before dissipating near Country View Court in the Arrowhead subdivision of Center Point.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Meanwhile, a broad warm and moist sector had spread north across all of the Ark-La-Tex into Eastern Oklahoma and much of Arkansas ahead of this trough, with temperatures warming into the upper 70s and lower 80s areawide. This resulted in moderate instability developing as large scale forcing increased during the late afternoon through the evening hours, resulting in scattered to numerous shower and thunderstorm development across much of these areas. Increasing wind shear late in the afternoon also promoted the development of scattered severe thunderstorms over East Texas, Southwest Arkansas, and Northwest Louisiana, with various reports of damaging winds and large hail received. However, one lone supercell developed over Eastern Anderson County Texas, which produced multiple tornadoes along its track from Cherokee County northeast into Northwest Nacogdoches, Southern Rusk, and Southern Panola Counties, before eventually moving into Northern Desoto and Southeast Caddo Parishes in Northwest Louisiana. These storms eventually organized along a broken line as it pushed into North Louisiana, ahead of a cold front that shifted southeast into the area during the early morning hours of the 28th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is a continuation of the Southern Rusk County tornado. This tornado continued northeast towards Lake Murvaul, where it maintained EF1 intensity while snapping and uprooting numerous trees as it paralleled FM 1971. Upon reaching the lake, the tornado reached several residences along the shoreline where it increased in intensity as it snapped and uprooted more trees and damaged the shingles of many homes. By this time, the tornado had strengthened to an EF2, with estimated maximum winds of 115 mph. One person was injured at their residence on the shore of Lake Murvaul, while video of the tornado was recorded by a storm chaser as it crossed the lake. After downing trees which damaged several structures on the east shore of the lake, it weakened and produced more sporadic damage before lifting north-northwest of Gary City. A review of video, TDEM ground survey data, and Sentinel satellite data indicate that the tornado lifted for approximately 5 miles before it touched down again in Southern Panola County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An associated, strengthening surface low also tracked out of the Great Lakes and into upstate New York. A warm front associated with this low moved through most of New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania during the late morning and early afternoon hours. This front, combined with the remains of widespread convection to the west from the previous overnight and morning hours, brought significant cloud cover to the eastern mid-Atlantic for much of the day on the 29th. This was mainly in the form of mid and high level cloud cover, however, and temperatures still warmed to near seasonal levels behind the warm front, allowing moderate to strong instability to build. Meanwhile, the robust surface and upper level disturbances approaching the region brought both strong forcing and unseasonably strong wind shear. By mid-afternoon, an unusually favorable convective environment existed over eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey.||The result of this environment was a rare tornado outbreak across the area. Initially, during the mid-afternoon hours, mixed convective modes over east-central Pennsylvania produced a couple instances of damaging wind and brief tornadoes as storms attempted to overcome cloud cover and some light stratiform rain in the area. With time, as storms moved into better instability and a less contaminated environment over far eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey, they took on more supercellular structures. Multiple cyclic supercells would go on to produce several tornadoes, three of them strong (EF2+) over eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Convection persisted past the sunset hour with little to no loss in intensity due to the strong forcing. The only thing that put an end to the outbreak was the coastline, as storms moved offshore towards 9 to 10PM local time. Even offshore, one supercell continued to exhibit strong rotation and likely produced a strong waterspout for tens of miles over the Atlantic.||Fortunately, and miraculously, no serious injuries or loss of life occurred as a result of this outbreak. With the passage of a cold front late on the evening of the 29th, cooler, drier, and much less active weather would grace the region for several days as clean-up efforts began.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The same supercell which produced a tornado in the New Jersey |Pine Barrens cycled and produced another tornado in far eastern |Ocean County. The tornado touched down near the immediate western |shore of Barnegat Bay. At least one building near Bay Beach off |Bayshore Dr sustained roofing damage. The tornado then moved over |Barnegat Bay as a waterspout. It came ashore in the area of High |Bar Harbor in Long Beach Twp.||The most severe damage was noted to a house on the corner of |Antioch Rd and Arnold Blvd. This house was facing west-southwest, |and had its entire roof structure lifted off and tossed one to two|houses to the east. The house walls remained standing but most of|the doors and windows on the east and west sides of the house |were completely blown out, with significant damage to the inside |of the house. A two- by-four from an adjacent house impaled the |wall on the west side of the house. Eight people were in the house|at the time the tornado hit, but they were able to take shelter |in an interior closet, with only minor injuries sustained. In |addition, on the north side of the house, a car in the driveway |was pushed sideways several feet and their boat flipped into their|neighbor's boat. The boat's trailer was tossed about 50 feet into|a house just to the east. The degree and orientation of damage |was consistent with tornadic winds of 115 to 120 mph, which is EF2|intensity.||Continuing east-northeast, about a dozen homes on the south side |of Arnold Blvd sustained significant uplift of roof material, |siding damage or removal, collapse of porch, patio, and sunroom |structures, and blown out windows. Several large trees were |uprooted and lay pointing to the east-northeast, as well as downed|power poles. ||The tornado moved east or slightly north of east from Arnold |Blvd, over an open salt marsh, before intersecting a few houses on|the corner of Collier Rd and Sunset Blvd. The most significant |damage was to a house on the northwest corner of Collier and |Sunset, which sustained siding damage, partial roof removal, |blowout of the storm surge walls on the basement level of the |elevated structure, and a large tree uprooted and laying to the |east-northeast. Power poles and large trees were downed on Sunset |Blvd, adjacent to the High Bar Harbor Yacht Club. There was damage|to several boats in the yacht club marina, but this was mainly |due to lofted debris being tossed into the marina. The circulation|then moved into the cove east of the marina. However, no further |significant damage was noted on the east side of the cover in |Barnegat Light, indicating the tornado had likely lifted. This is |corroborated by radar data which showed a weakening of the |circulation and a likely dissipation before it crossed into the |open Atlantic.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An associated, strengthening surface low also tracked out of the Great Lakes and into upstate New York. A warm front associated with this low moved through most of New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania during the late morning and early afternoon hours. This front, combined with the remains of widespread convection to the west from the previous overnight and morning hours, brought significant cloud cover to the eastern mid-Atlantic for much of the day on the 29th. This was mainly in the form of mid and high level cloud cover, however, and temperatures still warmed to near seasonal levels behind the warm front, allowing moderate to strong instability to build. Meanwhile, the robust surface and upper level disturbances approaching the region brought both strong forcing and unseasonably strong wind shear. By mid-afternoon, an unusually favorable convective environment existed over eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey.||The result of this environment was a rare tornado outbreak across the area. Initially, during the mid-afternoon hours, mixed convective modes over east-central Pennsylvania produced a couple instances of damaging wind and brief tornadoes as storms attempted to overcome cloud cover and some light stratiform rain in the area. With time, as storms moved into better instability and a less contaminated environment over far eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey, they took on more supercellular structures. Multiple cyclic supercells would go on to produce several tornadoes, three of them strong (EF2+) over eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Convection persisted past the sunset hour with little to no loss in intensity due to the strong forcing. The only thing that put an end to the outbreak was the coastline, as storms moved offshore towards 9 to 10PM local time. Even offshore, one supercell continued to exhibit strong rotation and likely produced a strong waterspout for tens of miles over the Atlantic.||Fortunately, and miraculously, no serious injuries or loss of life occurred as a result of this outbreak. With the passage of a cold front late on the evening of the 29th, cooler, drier, and much less active weather would grace the region for several days as clean-up efforts began.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The same supercell which produced a tornado in the New Jersey |Pine Barrens cycled and produced another tornado in far eastern |Ocean County. The tornado touched down near the immediate western |shore of Barnegat Bay. At least one building near Bay Beach off |Bayshore Dr sustained roofing damage. The tornado then moved over |Barnegat Bay as a waterspout. It came ashore in the area of High |Bar Harbor in Long Beach Twp.||The most severe damage was noted to a house on the corner of |Antioch Rd and Arnold Blvd. This house was facing west-southwest, |and had its entire roof structure lifted off and tossed one to two|houses to the east. The house walls remained standing but most of|the doors and windows on the east and west sides of the house |were completely blown out, with significant damage to the inside |of the house. A two- by-four from an adjacent house impaled the |wall on the west side of the house. Eight people were in the house|at the time the tornado hit, but they were able to take shelter |in an interior closet, with only minor injuries sustained. In |addition, on the north side of the house, a car in the driveway |was pushed sideways several feet and their boat flipped into their|neighbor's boat. The boat's trailer was tossed about 50 feet into|a house just to the east. The degree and orientation of damage |was consistent with tornadic winds of 115 to 120 mph, which is EF2|intensity.||Continuing east-northeast, about a dozen homes on the south side |of Arnold Blvd sustained significant uplift of roof material, |siding damage or removal, collapse of porch, patio, and sunroom |structures, and blown out windows. Several large trees were |uprooted and lay pointing to the east-northeast, as well as downed|power poles. ||The tornado moved east or slightly north of east from Arnold |Blvd, over an open salt marsh, before intersecting a few houses on|the corner of Collier Rd and Sunset Blvd. The most significant |damage was to a house on the northwest corner of Collier and |Sunset, which sustained siding damage, partial roof removal, |blowout of the storm surge walls on the basement level of the |elevated structure, and a large tree uprooted and laying to the |east-northeast. Power poles and large trees were downed on Sunset |Blvd, adjacent to the High Bar Harbor Yacht Club. There was damage|to several boats in the yacht club marina, but this was mainly |due to lofted debris being tossed into the marina. The circulation|then moved into the cove east of the marina. However, no further |significant damage was noted on the east side of the cover in |Barnegat Light, indicating the tornado had likely lifted. This is |corroborated by radar data which showed a weakening of the |circulation and a likely dissipation before it crossed into the |open Atlantic.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Across Middle Tennessee, a total of 16 tornadoes were determined to have touched down, making this the 5th largest tornado outbreak on record in Middle Tennessee. These tornadoes injured 8 people across Middle Tennessee and caused millions of dollars in property and tree damage in many counties. These tornadoes, combined with the 5 tornadoes that occurred just a few days earlier across Middle Tennessee on December 6, 2021, set a new record for the number of tornadoes during the month of December. In addition, many counties that had tornadoes in December 2021 had never recorded a tornado in the month of December before, including Stewart, Humphreys, Cheatham, Wilson, Trousdale, Overton, Pickett, Coffee, and Grundy Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This EF-2 tornado touched down near Highway 70 between White Bluff and Kingston Springs, blowing down a few trees and causing roof damage to a few homes in Dickson County. Moving into Cheatham County while staying north of Highway 70, there was severe roof damage to homes on Sneed Road and dozens of trees were snapped. Many more homes and a few businesses and churches suffered roof damage and dozens of trees were blown down further to the east along Highway 70, Butterworth Road, and Old Butterworth Road. Several outbuildings collapsed, more homes and churches were damaged, and power poles blown down further eastward along Highway 70 and Cedar Hill Road. The tornado continued northeastward across rural areas of southeastern Cheatham County, blowing down more trees and damaging roofs and outbuildings along Sams Creek Road, Indian Springs Road and Pond Creek Road before the tornado lifted just east of the Davidson County line. The track of this tornado was adjusted using high resolution NASA satellite imagery. Total path length of this tornado was 12.61 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Large hail, damaging winds and five tornadoes occurred across central and eastern Missouri as well as south central Illinois.  Unfortunately two of the tornadoes were very strong (rated EF-3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale) and responsible for 7 fatalities (one near Defiance, Missouri and six at an Amazon Facility near Edwardsville, Illinois). The Defiance, MO tornado tracked within one mile of the NWS St. Louis office in the Missouri Research Park near Weldon Spring, MO leading to the staff sheltering while NWS Kansas City provided service backup.  This is only the third time in the office's existence that the staff had to shelter. The damage from the Defiance, MO EF3 tornado was estimated at $684,186 and is unknown for the remaining tracks at this time but early estimates are well into the millions due to the damage sustained at the Amazon facility near Edwardsville, IL.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado began on the south side of I-270 around three-quarters of a mile west of the I-270/I-255 interchange at 8:27 PM CST. Damage in this area consisted of several downed highway signs and a bent light pole. The tornado moved northeast and intensified rapidly after crossing I-255, striking an Amazon warehouse. The west-facing walls of the warehouse collapsed inward, which was followed by multiple structural failures as the tornado moved through the complex, including the collapse of additional walls and the loss of a large segment of the roof. This was the worst damage along the entire tornado track rated EF-3. Cars in the rear of the building were strewn eastward and power lines and several large high tension towers were also destroyed. There was one person injured and 6 fatalities at the Amazon facility. The tornado weakened as it moved northeast across Sand Road, where it destroyed an unanchored mobile home and an outbuilding, snapped trees, and downed power poles. Damage in this area was rated EF-1. Further northeast, the tornado crossed South University Drive where it snapped a power pole and downed additional trees. It then crossed into the Sunset Hills Country Club subdivision. Throughout a portion of the subdivision, there were downed trees, snapped branches, and superficial home damage consisting of missing shingles or small portions of roof covering. The tornado weakened further as it moved northeast, and lifted just west of Butler Boulevard at 8:35 PM CST. Noteworthy is debris from the Amazon warehouse was found along the entire track of this storm, tens of miles to the northeast of the warehouse. Overall, the tornado was rated EF3 with a path length of 4.22 miles and max path width of 300 yards.

Across Middle Tennessee, a total of 16 tornadoes were determined to have touched down, making this the 5th largest tornado outbreak on record in Middle Tennessee. These tornadoes injured 8 people across Middle Tennessee and caused millions of dollars in property and tree damage in many counties. These tornadoes, combined with the 5 tornadoes that occurred just a few days earlier across Middle Tennessee on December 6, 2021, set a new record for the number of tornadoes during the month of December. In addition, many counties that had tornadoes in December 2021 had never recorded a tornado in the month of December before, including Stewart, Humphreys, Cheatham, Wilson, Trousdale, Overton, Pickett, Coffee, and Grundy Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This major, long-track EF-3 tornado first touched down in Newbern near Washington Street in west Tennessee. The tornado moved northeast, uprooting and snapping numerous trees along its path. Several homes had significant roof damage. The tornado initially produced EF-1 damage but while progressing northeast, it continued to strengthen to EF-3 as it approached Dresden. Several buildings and homes in downtown Dresden suffered significant damage or were completely destroyed. The tornado slightly weakened and moved northeast toward Paris Landing and eventually crossed the Tennessee River. 5 people were injured in west Tennessee. The tornado clipped the Fort Donelson National Battlefield area of extreme southeastern Calloway County, Kentucky where it blew down several trees, then crossed the Tennessee River into the Land Between the Lakes area of Stewart County and did massive tree damage to heavily wooded areas uprooting thousands of trees along its path. The tornado struck a well constructed single family brick home near Bear Creek where it took off the roof and top story. It then continued to travel northeast where it passed Indian Branch and Morgan Branch where it continued to uproot trees and destroyed some farm outbuildings, lifted the roofs off of some single and double wide mobile homes and completely flattened some barns and single wide structures. The most widespread and severe damage in Stewart County was between Indian Branch and Morgan Branch to the south of Bumpus Mills. The tornado then continued northeast across the far northwest corner of Fort Campbell Army Base continuing to blow down trees before moving into Kentucky. The tornado received a maximum rating of EF2 in Stewart County, and 4 people were injured. The tornado passed just south of the city of Lafayette, Kentucky where it immediately struck a barn and knocked down several electrical transmission lines. The tornado tracked northeast over mostly open country before causing significant damage to several homes off of Boddie Road and Darnell Road. More significant damage occurred to several homes, farm outbuildings, and structures on Palmyra Road. A mobile home was completely demolished and significant roofing damage was done to a brick home on Herndon Oak Grove Road. As the tornado approached Interstate 24, mostly tree damage was observed with a few structures impacted as well. Once the tornado crossed Fort Campbell Blvd, additional damage to electrical transmission lines was observed including over a dozen wood poles snapped. The tornado continued northeast causing mostly tree damage before completely destroying four tobacco barns and damaging three equipment garages off of Bradshaw Road. Two other buildings were also heavily damaged along with multiple silos destroyed. Damage estimates were in the millions according to the owners for just this one farm. The tornado then took straight aim for the city of Pembroke where significant tree damage was observed along with multiple houses with roof damage. Once the tornado moved out of Pembroke, two mobile homes were completely destroyed with the occupants injured. The tornado then crossed into Todd County where mostly tree damage and damage to farm/outbuildings were observed. The tornado then lifted just before impacting the city of Elkton where straight-line winds became dominant. The tornado received a maximum rating of EF2 in Christian County and EF1 in Todd County, and 4 people were injured. The next tornado then touched back down just to the east across the Todd/Logan County line. Total path length of this tornado was around 123 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Across Middle Tennessee, a total of 16 tornadoes were determined to have touched down, making this the 5th largest tornado outbreak on record in Middle Tennessee. These tornadoes injured 8 people across Middle Tennessee and caused millions of dollars in property and tree damage in many counties. These tornadoes, combined with the 5 tornadoes that occurred just a few days earlier across Middle Tennessee on December 6, 2021, set a new record for the number of tornadoes during the month of December. In addition, many counties that had tornadoes in December 2021 had never recorded a tornado in the month of December before, including Stewart, Humphreys, Cheatham, Wilson, Trousdale, Overton, Pickett, Coffee, and Grundy Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This major, long-track EF-3 tornado first touched down in Newbern near Washington Street in west Tennessee. The tornado moved northeast, uprooting and snapping numerous trees along its path. Several homes had significant roof damage. The tornado initially produced EF-1 damage but while progressing northeast, it continued to strengthen to EF-3 as it approached Dresden. Several buildings and homes in downtown Dresden suffered significant damage or were completely destroyed. The tornado slightly weakened and moved northeast toward Paris Landing and eventually crossed the Tennessee River. 5 people were injured in west Tennessee. The tornado clipped the Fort Donelson National Battlefield area of extreme southeastern Calloway County, Kentucky where it blew down several trees, then crossed the Tennessee River into the Land Between the Lakes area of Stewart County and did massive tree damage to heavily wooded areas uprooting thousands of trees along its path. The tornado struck a well constructed single family brick home near Bear Creek where it took off the roof and top story. It then continued to travel northeast where it passed Indian Branch and Morgan Branch where it continued to uproot trees and destroyed some farm outbuildings, lifted the roofs off of some single and double wide mobile homes and completely flattened some barns and single wide structures. The most widespread and severe damage in Stewart County was between Indian Branch and Morgan Branch to the south of Bumpus Mills. The tornado then continued northeast across the far northwest corner of Fort Campbell Army Base continuing to blow down trees before moving into Kentucky. The tornado received a maximum rating of EF2 in Stewart County, and 4 people were injured. The tornado passed just south of the city of Lafayette, Kentucky where it immediately struck a barn and knocked down several electrical transmission lines. The tornado tracked northeast over mostly open country before causing significant damage to several homes off of Boddie Road and Darnell Road. More significant damage occurred to several homes, farm outbuildings, and structures on Palmyra Road. A mobile home was completely demolished and significant roofing damage was done to a brick home on Herndon Oak Grove Road. As the tornado approached Interstate 24, mostly tree damage was observed with a few structures impacted as well. Once the tornado crossed Fort Campbell Blvd, additional damage to electrical transmission lines was observed including over a dozen wood poles snapped. The tornado continued northeast causing mostly tree damage before completely destroying four tobacco barns and damaging three equipment garages off of Bradshaw Road. Two other buildings were also heavily damaged along with multiple silos destroyed. Damage estimates were in the millions according to the owners for just this one farm. The tornado then took straight aim for the city of Pembroke where significant tree damage was observed along with multiple houses with roof damage. Once the tornado moved out of Pembroke, two mobile homes were completely destroyed with the occupants injured. The tornado then crossed into Todd County where mostly tree damage and damage to farm/outbuildings were observed. The tornado then lifted just before impacting the city of Elkton where straight-line winds became dominant. The tornado received a maximum rating of EF2 in Christian County and EF1 in Todd County, and 4 people were injured. The next tornado then touched back down just to the east across the Todd/Logan County line. Total path length of this tornado was around 123 miles.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado then produced extensive damage in the Macon community, destroying numerous mobile homes with moderate to major damage to several site built homes. In this area, tree damage was also extensive with numerous hardwoods snapped near the base along Ragan Chapel Road.  As the tornado approached Highway 77, it reached its maximum intensity and was likely multi-vortex in nature based on the damage pattern. Here, a large swath of trees were snapped. A large factory, Precision Materials, sustained major damage. The entire structure and supporting frame of this large well built metal building was collapsed and bent inward. The owner said they received the tornado warning and moved all employees into a safe shelter in the interior of the building before the tornado hit. None of the occupants were injured. A large tractor trailer at this location was also partially lofted and then dragged 60 feet. The damage at this location was rated EF-3 . The tornado crossed County Road 77, with damage to several homes along Ragans Chapel Road. At least two homes sustained significant damage with most of their roof removed and windows blown out. A large farm building was also demolished. Ragans Chapel UMC, a structure dating back to the late 1800s, sustained major damage with most walls collapsed. The caretaker���s home behind the church sustained major damage.||Along Mudd Street, several mobile homes were completely destroyed. A fatality occurred in one unanchored tiny home when the structure completely collapsed. Additional site built homes in the area from Mudd Street to Lost Creek Road sustained significant damage. The tornado continued northeast over mainly forested areas snapping and uprooting large swaths of trees. A wide expanse of damage was noted from Dark Hollow Road and Boiling Springs Road. Here many power lines were downed and poles snapped. Several site built homes sustained roof and structural damage, farm buildings and sheds were destroyed, and a mobile home was completely destroyed.||Significant damage was noted along Ingram Wells Road and Grayton Road South. Along Ingram Wells Road several homes were damaged and outbuildings destroyed. Along Grayton Road several mobile homes were destroyed with the undercarriages and contents blown well downstream. A doublewide mobile home also sustained significant damage. Three fatalities occurred here along with multiple significant injuries. A wide swath of tree damage continued along Grayton Road South and Mountain View Road.||The tornado then moved into the Wellington community as it crossed US Highway 431. Here several site built homes sustained moderate damage with partial loss of roof structures. Many power poles were also snapped along with damage to a convenience store. Significant damage was noted along Joe Martin Drive and Wellington Road. One site built home sustained collapse of most walls and cars were tossed. Six occupants sheltered safely in an interior closet. Additional homes sustained roof damage with one moved well off its foundation. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed. One occupant was killed near Mangum Road, but 13 others survived after sheltering in a family storm pit.||A wide swath of damage continued from East Wellington into Pleasant Valley with mobile homes destroyed along Old Sulphur Springs Road and site built homes with roof and structural damage. Trees were snapped and uprooted along County Road 204 along with damage to structures. Chicken houses were destroyed along Pleasant Valley Road, along with substantial damage to a church and business along Angel Drive. The tornado continued northeastward where additional damage was observed along Nisbet Lake Road, Dogwood Lane, and Charlie Penny Road. This was mostly timber damage where the tornado uprooted and snapped hundreds of trees. Varying degrees of minor structure damage was observed here as well. Farther northeast, the tornado moved toward New Liberty and Roy Webb Rd where damage was sustained at Learning Tree.

Ida made landfall across southeast Louisiana during the late morning on August 29th. Ida turned north and northeast across central Mississippi during late afternoon and evening on Monday, August 30th. ||The core of the hurricane force winds was relatively small, only extending out from the center about 50 miles. However tropical storm force winds extended outward over 150 miles from the center. This brought tropical storm force wind gusts to southeast Mississippi and much of southwest Alabama, with a brief period of sustained tropical storm force winds to coastal Alabama. Wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph were recorded  across southeast Mississippi and southwestern Alabama. The tropical storm force winds also downed several trees across the area.||The highest storm surge inundation values observed were between 3 to 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. Storm surge surveys indicated the highest water levels were in the Bayou La Batre area along and near Shell Belt Road where peak water levels were in the 4 to 4.5 feet MHHW range. ||The slow movement of the storm caused widespread flooding especially across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. Rainfall amounts of anywhere from 7 to 12 inches were recorded across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. This led to significant flash flooding along with significant river flooding.||Two tornadoes during the afternoon on August 30th. An EF-1 in northern Mobile County and an EF-1 in southern Clarke County.||Here is a breakdown of county impacts:||Stone County MS: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed several trees in Stone|County. Seven to ten inches of rain was recorded and one road had to be barricaded due to flooding. The low lying red creek and mill creek areas experienced flooding, impacting two RV parks.||George County MS: Eight to twelve inches of rain fell across George county which|resulted in significant flash flooding. A portion of Highway 26 collapsed just west of Lucedale, killing three people and injuring seven others. Eleven other roads were significantly flooded and had some form of washout or damage.||Mobile County AL: The west end of Dauphin Island was significantly impacted by Ida|from a combination of high surf, storm surge, and tropical storm force winds. Three miles of Bienville boulevard was impassable due to surge flooding and sand up to four feet deep. The high surf also produced minor damage to a few homes on the west end. Power poles were also knocked down on the island. Storm surge inundation peaked|between 3 and 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. The highest tidal gauge readings were 3.78 feet MHHW at Coast Guard sector Mobile and 3.82 feet MHHW at the Bayou La Batre bridge. Storm surge surveys along Shell Belt road in Bayou La Batre indicated water lines that reached between 4-4.5 feet.||This surge flooding resulted in closures of low lying coastal roads, such as Shell Belt road, the US Highway 90 causeway, the foot of the Dog river bridge, and the Dauphin Island causeway. Coastal flooding persisted across three high tide cycles which resulted in prolonged closures. Observations at Dauphin Island and Buccaneer Yacht Club on|Mobile Bay measured brief sustained periods of tropical storm force winds between 40-45 mph. Gusts of 50 to 60 mph were recorded in heavier rain bands across central and southern Mobile county. An EF-1 tornado impacted parts of Saraland, Satsuma, and Creola early in the afternoon on August 30th, resulting in three injuries. Rainfall|totals of 8 to 11 inches were recorded across the county, especially in southern and central portions. This heavy rainfall led to some urban flooding in neighborhoods and damaged some drainage culverts.||Baldwin County AL: Storm surge inundation of 3 to 4 feet above normally dry ground was recorded from Weeks Bay northward. This resulted in flooding of low lying areas and closure of the US Highway 90 Causeway. Five to nine inches of rain was measured across Baldwin county, which resulted in areas of flash flooding. A portion of River Road along Styx River was washed out due to heavy rainfall and flooding. A few drainage culverts were also significant damaged in the county.

Ida made landfall across southeast Louisiana during the late morning on August 29th. Ida turned north and northeast across central Mississippi during late afternoon and evening on Monday, August 30th. ||The core of the hurricane force winds was relatively small, only extending out from the center about 50 miles. However tropical storm force winds extended outward over 150 miles from the center. This brought tropical storm force wind gusts to southeast Mississippi and much of southwest Alabama, with a brief period of sustained tropical storm force winds to coastal Alabama. Wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph were recorded  across southeast Mississippi and southwestern Alabama. The tropical storm force winds also downed several trees across the area.||The highest storm surge inundation values observed were between 3 to 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. Storm surge surveys indicated the highest water levels were in the Bayou La Batre area along and near Shell Belt Road where peak water levels were in the 4 to 4.5 feet MHHW range. ||The slow movement of the storm caused widespread flooding especially across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. Rainfall amounts of anywhere from 7 to 12 inches were recorded across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. This led to significant flash flooding along with significant river flooding.||Two tornadoes during the afternoon on August 30th. An EF-1 in northern Mobile County and an EF-1 in southern Clarke County.||Here is a breakdown of county impacts:||Stone County MS: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed several trees in Stone|County. Seven to ten inches of rain was recorded and one road had to be barricaded due to flooding. The low lying red creek and mill creek areas experienced flooding, impacting two RV parks.||George County MS: Eight to twelve inches of rain fell across George county which|resulted in significant flash flooding. A portion of Highway 26 collapsed just west of Lucedale, killing three people and injuring seven others. Eleven other roads were significantly flooded and had some form of washout or damage.||Mobile County AL: The west end of Dauphin Island was significantly impacted by Ida|from a combination of high surf, storm surge, and tropical storm force winds. Three miles of Bienville boulevard was impassable due to surge flooding and sand up to four feet deep. The high surf also produced minor damage to a few homes on the west end. Power poles were also knocked down on the island. Storm surge inundation peaked|between 3 and 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. The highest tidal gauge readings were 3.78 feet MHHW at Coast Guard sector Mobile and 3.82 feet MHHW at the Bayou La Batre bridge. Storm surge surveys along Shell Belt road in Bayou La Batre indicated water lines that reached between 4-4.5 feet.||This surge flooding resulted in closures of low lying coastal roads, such as Shell Belt road, the US Highway 90 causeway, the foot of the Dog river bridge, and the Dauphin Island causeway. Coastal flooding persisted across three high tide cycles which resulted in prolonged closures. Observations at Dauphin Island and Buccaneer Yacht Club on|Mobile Bay measured brief sustained periods of tropical storm force winds between 40-45 mph. Gusts of 50 to 60 mph were recorded in heavier rain bands across central and southern Mobile county. An EF-1 tornado impacted parts of Saraland, Satsuma, and Creola early in the afternoon on August 30th, resulting in three injuries. Rainfall|totals of 8 to 11 inches were recorded across the county, especially in southern and central portions. This heavy rainfall led to some urban flooding in neighborhoods and damaged some drainage culverts.||Baldwin County AL: Storm surge inundation of 3 to 4 feet above normally dry ground was recorded from Weeks Bay northward. This resulted in flooding of low lying areas and closure of the US Highway 90 Causeway. Five to nine inches of rain was measured across Baldwin county, which resulted in areas of flash flooding. A portion of River Road along Styx River was washed out due to heavy rainfall and flooding. A few drainage culverts were also significant damaged in the county. Tropical storm conditions were confined primarily to immediate coastal areas, particularly along the Fort Morgan peninsula.||Clarke County AL: An EF-1 Tornado impacted portions of southern Clarke County, significantly damaging a couple of structures.||Escambia County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand on coastal roadways along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for an extended period of time.||Santa Rosa County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for and extended period of time.||Okaloosa County FL: Strong rip currents produced by Ida resulted in two rip current fatalities in the wake of the storm.

The tornado then impacted KY 527 (Saloma Road) where more structures had significant damage. At one particular residence, the entire second floor of the brick home was removed. Hundreds of trees near and just beyond the road had been snapped or uprooted. Damage in this area consisted of EF-1 to EF-2 ratings. The tornado continued to intensify to the northeast as it impacted Sanders Road. It was here where the worst damage (EF-3) was observed. Wide swaths of forest, over a quarter mile wide, were completely snapped or uprooted. Drone imagery showed some ground scarring in concentrated areas. Homes in the direct path of the tornado were severely damaged with no walls left standing. The tornado weakened some as it continued toward Marion County. Several homes had missing or severely damaged roofs near Old Lebanon Road. Trees were uprooted or snapped.

A violent EF-4 tornado began in far northwest Tennessee, and moved across western Kentucky, resulting in dozens of lost lives and a swath of destruction. The tornado was on the ground for 128 miles within the NWS Paducah forecast area, and the total path length was about 165 miles from Obion County, TN to Breckinridge County, KY. Another long-track EF-3 tornado started in Dyer County, TN, and traveled about 125 miles through northwest Tennessee and into Christian and Todd Counties in western Kentucky. A strong upper-level trough over the western Plains induced a deepening surface low that tracked northeast across the Iowa/Illinois border. A very strong and deep southwest wind flow brought moist and unstable air into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Record high temperatures were recorded, including a high of 73 at Paducah. The combination of very strong winds aloft, unseasonably warm conditions, and a strong low pressure system were ideal for this tornado outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This historic EF-4 tornado was associated with a very long-track supercell that originally formed over eastern Arkansas. The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell). This tornado crossed from Obion County, Tennessee into Fulton County, Kentucky about 6 miles southeast of Hickman, close to the communities of State Line, KY and Woodland Mills, TN. The tornado rapidly widened, becoming over a mile wide across northeast Fulton County. The primary impact to Fulton County was on the community of Cayce, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This community was the site of the only fatality in Fulton County. A 57-year-old male occupant of a mobile home was killed. On the southwest edge of Cayce, a house was demolished (DI 2, DOD 9). This demolished house was assigned an estimated wind speed of 170 mph, the highest in the county. A small retail building in the center of town was demolished (DI 8, DOD 8). A total of 61 structures were affected in Fulton County, with 21 of those totally destroyed or uninhabitable. A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some farm equipment. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the Cayce area. The average path width was a mile.

This tornado crossed from Fulton County into Hickman County about 7 miles northwest of Fulton, close to the community of Croley. The tornado was exceptionally wide as it entered Hickman County, becoming about 1.5 miles wide. The tornado track in Hickman County was over rural farmland, bypassing small communities. The tornado achieved a rating of EF-3 over far eastern Hickman County, along Highway 58 near the Graves County line. This is where numerous wooden towers carrying electrical transmission lines collapsed (DI 24, DOD 6). This damage site is where the tornado was assigned the highest estimated wind speed in the county, about 140 mph. On Highway 307, there were four collapsed metal truss towers for carrying electrical transmission lines (DI 24, DOD 6). There were several injuries but no fatalities in the county. About a dozen homes were destroyed countywide. A mobile home was destroyed (DI 3, DOD 9). Most walls of one destroyed house collapsed, except small interior rooms (DI 2, DOD 8). The damage rating of this house was lowered due to toe nail construction. A total of 41 homes were damaged in Hickman County, and 12 were destroyed or uninhabitable. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted. The average path width was about 1.25 miles (2250 yards).

A violent EF-4 tornado began in far northwest Tennessee, and moved across western Kentucky, resulting in dozens of lost lives and a swath of destruction. The tornado was on the ground for 128 miles within the NWS Paducah forecast area, and the total path length was about 165 miles from Obion County, TN to Breckinridge County, KY. Another long-track EF-3 tornado started in Dyer County, TN, and traveled about 125 miles through northwest Tennessee and into Christian and Todd Counties in western Kentucky. A strong upper-level trough over the western Plains induced a deepening surface low that tracked northeast across the Iowa/Illinois border. A very strong and deep southwest wind flow brought moist and unstable air into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Record high temperatures were recorded, including a high of 73 at Paducah. The combination of very strong winds aloft, unseasonably warm conditions, and a strong low pressure system were ideal for this tornado outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This historic EF-4 tornado was associated with a very long-track supercell that originally formed over eastern Arkansas. The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell). This tornado crossed from Fulton County into Hickman County about 7 miles northwest of Fulton, close to the community of Croley. The tornado was exceptionally wide as it entered Hickman County, becoming about 1.5 miles wide. The tornado track in Hickman County was over rural farmland, bypassing small communities. The tornado achieved a rating of EF-3 over far eastern Hickman County, along Highway 58 near the Graves County line. This is where numerous wooden towers carrying electrical transmission lines collapsed (DI 24, DOD 6). This damage site is where the tornado was assigned the highest estimated wind speed in the county, about 140 mph. On Highway 307, there were four collapsed metal truss towers for carrying electrical transmission lines (DI 24, DOD 6). There were several injuries but no fatalities in the county. About a dozen homes were destroyed countywide. A mobile home was destroyed (DI 3, DOD 9). Most walls of one destroyed house collapsed, except small interior rooms (DI 2, DOD 8). The damage rating of this house was lowered due to toe nail construction. A total of 41 homes were damaged in Hickman County, and 12 were destroyed or uninhabitable. Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted. The average path width was about 1.25 miles (2250 yards). The tornado exited Hickman County into Graves County in a rural area about one-half mile north of where Highway 58 crosses the county line.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This tornado crossed from Hickman County into Graves County about one-half mile north of where Highway 58 crosses the county line, close to the tiny community of Baltimore. The tornado was about 1.3 miles wide when it entered the county. It varied from 1 to 1.3 miles in width as it traversed Graves County. The primary impact to Graves County was on the city of Mayfield, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This city suffered a devastating impact, in terms of both loss of life and property destruction. There were 23 fatalities countywide and many more injuries. On the southwest edge of Mayfield as the tornado entered the city, a candle factory was demolished (DI 23, DOD 7). At least nine workers in the factory were killed. The tornado continued northeast through the heart of Mayfield at 9:28 PM CST, averaging just over one mile in width. The downtown area was directly impacted, crippling the police and fire department headquarters and emergency communications. Residential neighborhoods both southwest and northeast of downtown were destroyed. Numerous businesses in the downtown business district collapsed. Several damage sites in the city of Mayfield received a wind speed estimate of 188 mph, the highest in the county. Many of the structures were historic brick buildings (DI 17, DOD 7). At least 1,500 structures were damaged or destroyed, including a couple hundred businesses. The Red Cross estimated that 730 dwellings were uninhabitable. A large number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some farm equipment in rural areas outside the city. Nearly total tree destruction was observed. The first EF-4 damage in the county was noted at and around the candle factory on the southwest side of Mayfield. Near the candle factory, a house was swept clean off the concrete slab (DI 2, DOD 10). The last EF-4 damage points in the county were on the northeast side of Mayfield, including a nursing home (DI 7, DOD 7). After entering Graves County, the tornado intersected I-69 (formerly the Purchase Parkway) four miles southwest of the Mayfield city limit. A wind gust to 93 knots or 107 mph was measured at the University of Kentucky mesonet site 6 miles southwest of Mayfield. The tornado then closely followed Interstate 69 northeast all the way to Marshall County. The tornado crossed the interstate multiple times. The first crossing was two miles southwest of Mayfield, then again northeast of Mayfield just east of the Highway 131 interchange, and again at the Marshall County line. The interstate was blocked in spots by trees, power lines, and debris. From Highway 131 to Highway 301 northeast of Mayfield, the tornado followed the exact same path as the May 10, 2016 EF-3 tornado. Some of the same structures that were damaged in that tornado were destroyed by this tornado.

The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on the beginning of this tornado). This tornado crossed from Graves County into Marshall County along Interstate 69 about seven miles west-southwest of Benton. The tornado  widened to nearly 1.5 miles (2450 yards) soon after crossing into Marshall County. The tornado width fluctuated from 0.8 mile to nearly 1.5 miles during its trek across the county. The community most impacted was Cambridge Shores, a rather dense subdivision of vacation homes and some luxury homes on Kentucky Lake. This is the only location in Marshall County where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This community was the site of the only fatalities in Marshall County. A 78-year-old female resident died in the hallway of her house. Another elderly woman died of a heart attack while trying to remove debris (indirect). There were numerous homes in Cambridge Shores that were levelled, including the loss of all walls (DI 2, DOD 9). Some homes were wiped off the foundation. Marshall County's highest wind speed estimate of 170 mph was assigned to the damage in the Cambridge Shores area. A total of 356 structures in Marshall County were destroyed or uninhabitable. Another 341 structures sustained light to moderate damage. A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some that landed in Kentucky Lake. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the Cambridge Shores area. After crossing into Marshall County, the tornado path stayed over Interstate 69 from the county line to about three miles west of Benton. In this area a few miles west of Benton, a home was blown off its foundation and a few other homes were demolished (DI 2, DOD 9). The tornado narrowly missed the county seat of Benton, passing only a mile or two northwest of the downtown area. Where the tornado crossed U.S. 641 just north of Benton, a home was destroyed with the exception of some interior walls (DI 2, DOD 8). The tornado crossed U.S. Highway 68 about one mile southeast of the county high school, then continued on to Cambridge Shores. The tornado exited Marshall County into Lyon County over Kentucky Lake, about 1.5 miles east-northeast of Cambridge Shores.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A violent EF-4 tornado began in far northwest Tennessee, and moved across western Kentucky, resulting in dozens of lost lives and a swath of destruction. The tornado was on the ground for 128 miles within the NWS Paducah forecast area, and the total path length was about 165 miles from Obion County, TN to Breckinridge County, KY. Another long-track EF-3 tornado started in Dyer County, TN, and traveled about 125 miles through northwest Tennessee and into Christian and Todd Counties in western Kentucky. A strong upper-level trough over the western Plains induced a deepening surface low that tracked northeast across the Iowa/Illinois border. A very strong and deep southwest wind flow brought moist and unstable air into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Record high temperatures were recorded, including a high of 73 at Paducah. The combination of very strong winds aloft, unseasonably warm conditions, and a strong low pressure system were ideal for this tornado outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This historic EF-4 tornado was associated with a very long-track supercell that originally formed over eastern Arkansas. The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on the beginning of this tornado). This tornado crossed from Graves County into Marshall County along Interstate 69 about seven miles west-southwest of Benton. The tornado  widened to nearly 1.5 miles (2450 yards) soon after crossing into Marshall County. The tornado width fluctuated from 0.8 mile to nearly 1.5 miles during its trek across the county. The community most impacted was Cambridge Shores, a rather dense subdivision of vacation homes and some luxury homes on Kentucky Lake. This is the only location in Marshall County where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. This community was the site of the only fatalities in Marshall County. A 78-year-old female resident died in the hallway of her house. Another elderly woman died of a heart attack while trying to remove debris (indirect). There were numerous homes in Cambridge Shores that were levelled, including the loss of all walls (DI 2, DOD 9). Some homes were wiped off the foundation. Marshall County's highest wind speed estimate of 170 mph was assigned to the damage in the Cambridge Shores area. A total of 356 structures in Marshall County were destroyed or uninhabitable. Another 341 structures sustained light to moderate damage. A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed, including some that landed in Kentucky Lake. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the Cambridge Shores area. After crossing into Marshall County, the tornado path stayed over Interstate 69 from the county line to about three miles west of Benton. In this area a few miles west of Benton, a home was blown off its foundation and a few other homes were demolished (DI 2, DOD 9). The tornado narrowly missed the county seat of Benton, passing only a mile or two northwest of the downtown area. Where the tornado crossed U.S. 641 just north of Benton, a home was destroyed with the exception of some interior walls (DI 2, DOD 8). The tornado crossed U.S. Highway 68 about one mile southeast of the county high school, then continued on to Cambridge Shores. The tornado exited Marshall County into Lyon County over Kentucky Lake, about 1.5 miles east-northeast of Cambridge Shores.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A house near this country club received the highest wind speed estimate in the county, which was 180 mph. The tornado crossed southeast of Princeton, destroying large sections of the University Of Kentucky Research and Education Center (DI 15, DOD 10). The tornado then damaged many homes and trees near and just south of U.S. Highway 62 (Dawson Road). Just southwest of the intersection of US 62 and CR 2619, the tornado took a more easterly path (or rightward jog), continuing to damage homes along U.S. Highway 62 (Dawson Road) (DI 2, DOD 9). Two of the fatalities occurred at permanent homes on Dawson Road. The tornado trajectory then shifted back to northeast (or leftward jog), after which it crossed into Hopkins County on the southwest side of Dawson Springs. There were four fatalities in Caldwell County, with 11 others injured, 3 critically. All four of the deceased were found outside their residences. A couple who resided in a mobile home were both killed between Princeton and Dawson Springs. In total, around 300 structures were completely destroyed.

Another long-track EF-3 tornado started in Dyer County, TN, and traveled about 125 miles through northwest Tennessee and into Christian and Todd Counties in western Kentucky. A strong upper-level trough over the western Plains induced a deepening surface low that tracked northeast across the Iowa/Illinois border. A very strong and deep southwest wind flow brought moist and unstable air into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Record high temperatures were recorded, including a high of 73 at Paducah. The combination of very strong winds aloft, unseasonably warm conditions, and a strong low pressure system were ideal for this tornado outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This historic EF-4 tornado was associated with a very long-track supercell that originally formed over eastern Arkansas. The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell). The tornado crossed from Lyon County into Caldwell County in a rural area about 7 miles east southeast of Eddyville. The tornado crossed the Princeton Golf and Country Club resulting in collapsed walls of nearby homes (DI 2, DOD 10). This is where it achieved its highest rating of EF-4. A house near this country club received the highest wind speed estimate in the county, which was 180 mph. The tornado crossed southeast of Princeton, destroying large sections of the University Of Kentucky Research and Education Center (DI 15, DOD 10). The tornado then damaged many homes and trees near and just south of U.S. Highway 62 (Dawson Road). Just southwest of the intersection of US 62 and CR 2619, the tornado took a more easterly path (or rightward jog), continuing to damage homes along U.S. Highway 62 (Dawson Road) (DI 2, DOD 9). Two of the fatalities occurred at permanent homes on Dawson Road. The tornado trajectory then shifted back to northeast (or leftward jog), after which it crossed into Hopkins County on the southwest side of Dawson Springs. There were four fatalities in Caldwell County, with 11 others injured, 3 critically. All four of the deceased were found outside their residences. A couple who resided in a mobile home were both killed between Princeton and Dawson Springs. In total, around 300 structures were completely destroyed. The average path width was a mile.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell).  This tornado crossed from Caldwell County into Hopkins County near the city limit of Dawson Springs, which straddles the county line. The tornado produced catastrophic damage and some fatalities in Dawson Springs. About two-thirds of the city's homes were destroyed, and about a dozen fatalities occurred. There were at least 200 injuries. The core of the tornado narrowly missed the downtown Dawson Springs business district, but a large residential neighborhood on the north side of downtown was destroyed. This neighborhood is where the tornado obtained its maximum EF-4 rating in Hopkins County. A two-story apartment building was almost totally destroyed. Only a few first-story interior walls remained standing (DI 5, DOD 6). This apartment building is where the damage was assigned a wind speed estimate of 180 mph, the highest in the county. On the northern edge of town, over a dozen duplexes suffered complete roof loss. All exterior and interior walls of one of the units collapsed (DI 2, DOD 9). Most of the single-family homes suffered complete roof loss and the loss of most exterior walls (DI 2, DOD 8). In a few cases, there was complete destruction of residences (DI 2, DOD 10). On Highway 109 on the northeast side of town, a large retail structure with a long-span roof was destroyed (DI 12, DOD 7). Nearby, about a half dozen other smaller homes and businesses were demolished, including the loss of all walls (DI 9, DOD 9). Once the tornado exited the Dawson Springs area, it crossed Interstate 69 (formerly the Western Kentucky Parkway) about three miles northeast of Dawson Springs. A clearly defined wide path of nearly total tree destruction crossed the interstate. A house near the interstate suffered the loss of the roof and most walls, except for a few walls of small interior rooms (DI 2, DOD 8). Where the tornado crossed Highway 112, a few single-family homes were demolished, including the loss of the roof and all or most walls (DI 2, DOD 8-9). The tornado continued across heavily forested land until reaching Barnsley, a small community between Earlington and Mortons Gap on U.S. Highway 41. Several houses were demolished, including the loss of all walls (DI 2, DOD 9). In addition, a train was derailed and a 55-foot tanker car was thrown 20 yards from the railroad tracks (DI 29, DOD 1). The tornado then continued through a long swath of forest before crossing Interstate 69 midway between Madisonville and the Western Kentucky Parkway. Hundreds of trees were snapped at this interstate crossing (DI 27, DOD 4). A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed across the county. The total number of affected structures countywide was estimated near 1000. A little over 500 structures were completely destroyed. Nearly total tree destruction was observed all along the path. The average path width was a mile. The tornado exited Hopkins County across the Pond River into Muhlenberg County about 6.5 miles east-southeast of Madisonville.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell). This tornado crossed from Hopkins County into Muhlenberg County at the Pond River, about 8 miles southwest of Bremen.  The primary impact to Muhlenberg County was in and around the community of Bremen, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. The Bremen area was the site of most of the 11 fatalities in Muhlenberg County. A total of 165 structures were damaged or destroyed, of which 84 were completely destroyed or uninhabitable. The remainder were damaged at least moderately. The majority of these structures were along and just south of Highway 175 from 5 miles southwest of Bremen to the community of Bremen. Several demolished houses in this area warranted a rating of EF-4. The destruction of one house warranted a wind speed estimate of 190 mph, the highest in the county and the entire track. One brick home on Highway 175 collapsed, and another was swept off the foundation (DI 2, DOD 9). A car in the garage was thrown across the road. A couple of poorly anchored houses were swept clean off the foundation within a few miles west of Bremen (DI 2, DOD 9-10). On the north side of Bremen, a two-story home was completely destroyed. The  foundation was not swept clean, but all walls were gone. Much of the remainder of the path through Muhlenberg County was unpopulated woods and fields. There was a cluster of damaged or destroyed structures near the community of Moorman, near where the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 431. In this area, a couple houses were heavily damaged, but most walls remained standing (DI 2, DOD 6). A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed countywide, including some farm equipment. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the path. The average path width was a mile. The tornado exited Muhlenberg County into Ohio County on the Green River about 2.5 miles east of Moorman.

The supercell produced a nearly continuous tornado damage path from northeast Arkansas across western Tennessee and western Kentucky. The starting point of this particular tornado was in northwest Tennessee, northwest of Union City (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western for information on this and other tornadoes associated with the supercell). This tornado crossed from Hopkins County into Muhlenberg County at the Pond River, about 8 miles southwest of Bremen.  The primary impact to Muhlenberg County was in and around the community of Bremen, where the tornado achieved a rating of EF-4. The Bremen area was the site of most of the 11 fatalities in Muhlenberg County. A total of 165 structures were damaged or destroyed, of which 84 were completely destroyed or uninhabitable. The remainder were damaged at least moderately. The majority of these structures were along and just south of Highway 175 from 5 miles southwest of Bremen to the community of Bremen. Several demolished houses in this area warranted a rating of EF-4. The destruction of one house warranted a wind speed estimate of 190 mph, the highest in the county and the entire track. One brick home on Highway 175 collapsed, and another was swept off the foundation (DI 2, DOD 9). A car in the garage was thrown across the road. A couple of poorly anchored houses were swept clean off the foundation within a few miles west of Bremen (DI 2, DOD 9-10). On the north side of Bremen, a two-story home was completely destroyed. The  foundation was not swept clean, but all walls were gone. Much of the remainder of the path through Muhlenberg County was unpopulated woods and fields. There was a cluster of damaged or destroyed structures near the community of Moorman, near where the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 431. In this area, a couple houses were heavily damaged, but most walls remained standing (DI 2, DOD 6). A number of vehicles were thrown and destroyed countywide, including some farm equipment. Nearly total tree destruction was observed in the path. The average path width was a mile. The tornado exited Muhlenberg County into Ohio County on the Green River about 2.5 miles east of Moorman. See Storm Data, Kentucky, Central for information on the remainder of this tornado path.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Central Kentucky saw 18 tornadoes that injured 96 and killed 18. An additional death occurred in a flash flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado formed approximately 1 mile southwest of Crossroads near Watlington Road and tracked northeast for approximately 22 miles before crossing into western Warren County. The tornado continued approximately 6 miles into Warren County before dissipating at 0114 CST. In Logan County, the supercell that had cycled down its tornado in eastern Todd County (but continued to produce wind damage northeast of Elkton) spun back up again soon after crossing the border into western Logan County. It quickly ramped up to EF-3 (140 mph) intensity with a damage swath roughly three quarters of a mile wide along Milton Sharp Rd. On the southern side, a family was home when a 2 by 4 narrowly missed the husband as the roof was being peeled off the middle of the house. On the north side, a large dairy farm was completely destroyed. As the tornado continued northeast, a wide swath of trees was snapped/uprooted along the edge of a forest on the southern edge of the vortex, while on the north edge a well built home had its second floor two-thirds thrown off. A male was in the other section when a 2 by 4 from the first floor came up and got lodged in his mattress. Another well built log cabin in this area lost its second floor roof. The tornado then turned more ENE in the Buena Vista Rd area. A doublewide manufactured home was completely destroyed here along with several outbuildings on the property. A male at the home received warning from family and heard the tornado approach, getting into a bath tub in the middle of the east side of the structure. After it hit, the home blew into a row of trees and the male remembers grabbing onto a tree southeast of his original location. He sustained injuries as medics had to get wood out of his legs. The tornado continued over to Lakewood Ln where a boy was in the second story of a house when the window imploded inward and moved the bed he was in. After this, the storm crossed US 431, impacting several trees along Hwy 1040 with EF1 level winds. It then moved to a row of mobile homes along H.C. Johnson Rd. Two of these homes were completely destroyed, with one blown into a row of trees south of its original point and another lifted up and over a tree just east of its original location. This may have been a mesovortex spinning around the main circulation. The tornado damage was widest at this location, roughly 0.8 mile. On the south side of the tornado, a mobile home was completely destroyed along Hwy 915 where it was spread out over the road. The resident was a female whose father insisted she stay the night at his place, with a basement, after hearing the messaging in the days before. That same mesovortex may have been what caused the collapse of an electric transmission line just east of Marshall Rd where there was little damage to surrounding trees. Farther north on that road a well built brick home had its roof taken off as well as the carport removed. The tornado continued to track along Hwy 79 towards the Chandlers Chapel area where the Methodist Church lost its steeple and had damage to several of the stained glass windows. A couple of homes had major damage here. A resident said he had at least 20 minutes of warning lead time ahead of the touchdown. There was additional damage along Turner Road and then 3 Poplars Rd. This survey ended soon after 3 Poplars Rd. Another survey was conducted in the far northeast corner of Logan County where a couple of long chicken barns were leveled.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Central Kentucky saw 18 tornadoes that injured 96 and killed 18. An additional death occurred in a flash flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The National Weather Service in Louisville surveyed a tornadic supercell over the course of 6 days in Warren County which directly struck Bowling Green. The tornado first touched down in rural southwestern Warren County just south of the intersection of Wimpee Smith Road and Petros Browning Rd. It tracked to the northeast for approximately 26 miles before entering Edmonson County. The tornado continued approximately 3.6 miles into Edmonson before dissipating at 0138 CST. At the tornado's beginning in Warren County, the tornado twisted, snapped, topped and uprooted softwood and hardwood trees. The tornado was about 200 yards wide, with EF1 winds of 90 mph. Aerial photography confirmed the tornado was continuous in this rugged area of southwest Warren County. The tornado increased to EF2, between 120 and 125 mph, doing major damage to several older barns along Tommy Smith Road. It threw a 1700 pound cattle trailer, 300 yards into a creek ravine.The NWS drone showed a distinct narrow main funnel within the larger funnel. This 30 to 35 yard funnel was clearly seen scouring the corn field and produced the most concentrated damage. The narrow funnel crossed Browning Rd and hit a well constructed house. The only major part of the house that survived was an interior bathroom and hallway. Winds were estimated at 135 mph, and areas outside the narrow funnel had damage of 100 mph, and the entire overall width was 250 yards wide. The survey team found extensive tree damage along Van Meter Rd and Fuqua Rd and aerial photography confirmed the tornado was continuous in this rugged, mainly forested area. The tornado did minor roof damage to some homes along Blue Level Road with winds of 86 to 90 mph but did more substantial roof and side damage to several barns with winds of 90 to 95 mph. Based on drone technology, there appeared to be two distinct areas of damage, and likely had a smaller satellite tornado. There was extensive roof damage to the Zomi Agape fellowship center with insulation thrown both downwind and on the upwind side of the building. The tornado increased in speed when it was over Old Tramm Rd by Rembrandt Court and Powell Road. One house on Rembrandt Court was knocked off its foundation by the garage attachment and slid about 15 feet. Other homes were knocked down to just interior bathrooms and hallways remaining, but there were some foundation construction concerns. EF2 winds of 130 to 135 mph were evidenced in this area. Several houses were knocked down to the foundation, but there were foundation construction concerns. In addition, farm equipment from a barn on the right side of Powell St was thrown directly into homes on the left side of Powell Rd. The survey team found significant house damage to dozens of homes in the Creekwood subdivision. This included exterior collapsed walls, roofs blown off, foundations severely compromised, garages blown in, insulation blown on all four sides of houses, and garages severely damaged or destroyed. In fact, they were dozens of double garages damaged, where one garage door blew in and the other garage door blew out. There were hundreds of powerlines and snapped power poles down throughout the county. Trees were uprooted snapped and twisted facing in all directions. Dozens of cars were flipped, twisted, turned, and thrown into homes. 2 x 4s were thrown into the ground, like missiles. Several splintered boards were impaled into vehicle windshields, tires, and along the hood grills. Most of the damage was rated EF2 from 115 to 135 mph except for 8 homes near Mossy Creek. The survey team brought in engineers from WKU to look at 8 homes, which were wiped down to the foundation from Moss Creek to Mossy Stone. Engineers helped in determining winds speeds were 160 mph for these houses, a high EF3 rating. Tragically, several fatalities occurred in the subdivision area. The tornado was 250 yards wide in Creekwood, but increased to about 350 yards wide before crossing Veterans Parkway. The tornado crossed the William Natcher Parkway and hit large townhouses along Veterans Parkway. There were numerous windows shattered and some roof damage. One of the town houses was shifted off the foundation, but there were no bricks or other support on it. The tornado crossed Russellville Rd hitting many businesses. At Royal Motor Cars, several storage buildings were destroyed, major loss of roof panels at Cabreras Mexican restaurant and an auto parts store. At Plumbers Supply company at 2321 Russellville Rd. The garage was blown in and collapsed. The main building had a shifted foundation, and a partial collapse of some exterior cinderblock walls, tractors and trailers were twisted and flipped, and there was numerous power poles snapped. The Shell gas station had major damage to service station canopy and store, as well as walls of an Enterprise car rental. The tornado increased to quarter mile wide and went from EF2 of 130 mph, from Royal Motorcars to AutoZone, and then decreased to EF2, 115-120 mph and narrowed to 1/8th of a mile with major tree and roof damage along Lealand Street, Cedar Ridge, and University Drive. A fully loaded dumpster was thrown 250 yards. At Russell Road and Springhill Avenue, a Marathon gas station had its pumps destroyed, and most of the exterior walls were destroyed. The tornado missed Western Kentucky University by 225 yards, but debris was thrown all over the campus including some impaled debris into buildings. The tornado went along 31W including doing significant damage to roof at Bobas lounge, a liquor store, and a smoke shop. This was estimated to be 110 to 120 mph winds, and tornado width decreased to 250 yards by Walgreens and Taco Bell. The tornado, appeared to be slightly elevated, doing mainly tree damage, power poles, and house roofing and siding along Magnolia Ave and Nutwood St. It crossed Lehman, went along Covington, with wind speeds mainly of 95 to 110 mph. The owner of 708 Nutwood said, your warning saved our lives, as our house was violently shaking, but we sought shelter and lived. Much of the tree damage was facing from the northeast to the northwest. The tornado paralleled Cemetery Rd doing roof and gutter damage along with power lines and tree damage. The tornadoes speed and winds increased along Cherokee Dr. with roofs removed and large healthy hardwood trees uprooted. The width increased to 300 yards and speeds to 105 mph with width of 225 yards. The narrow 175 yard funnel, hit the Indian Hills golf course, twisting, snapping, and topping numerous pines and cedars with winds speeds of 86 to 90 mph. The tornado then crossed the Barren River and increased in speed along Old Porter Pike to EF2, between 111 and 120 mph. Huge diameter hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted, including several very tall oak trees. There was also extensive roof damage to some well built homes. It weakened as it approached exit 28, doing EF1 damage of 90-95 mph to Hucks gas station and damaged a very tall Wendys sign. On the north side of 31 W, a fully loaded 18 wheeler facing west, was knocked over and was dragged 15 yards to a northwesterly directly. Winds were increased to EF2, of 115 mph. At the Corvette plant there was significant roof damage, with metal sheeting, insulation, HVAC units, and other debris thrown hundreds of yards downwind. Light poles in the parking lot were snapped, One of the security checkpoints at the Corvette plant was totally destroyed with large sections of the building being thrown several hundred yards, and weighing over 100 pounds, striking several vehicles. Winds were mainly in the 110 to 120 mph range. The tornado continued to parallel I 65, just west of the interstate. It struck several homes at Bristow Rd and Friendship Rd. Most of the damage was done to roofs siding and gutters and destroyed a well- built greenhouse. Numerous power poles and lines were down and the debris pattern was facing from southeasterly, all the way to northwesterly. There was some barn and tree damage near Kelly Road and the CSX railroad crossing. Winds were 85 to 90 mph and width of 200 yards. The tornado really increased across the TransPark at Exit 30. A few metal building structures at the peak intensity of the tornado sustained heavy damage. The middle building totally collapsed. Analysis showed that building was well constructed, but the shearing force from the intense tornado ripped the metal frame from the anchoring plates of the building. Analysis of the third building showed the tornado had weakened some at this point, down to EF2 levels. The WSR-8D radar showed a Tornadic Debris Signature downstream of this area, which was lofted to around 18 kft, right at the high end of EF3 of 165 mph. The tornado weakened further downstream as it caused roofing and siding damage to several structures and tree damage into southeast Edmonson County. Civil Air Patrol imagery helped identify the end point of this tornado.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This resulted in unusually warm temperatures for a December day and the ingredients to produce a historic tornado outbreak and flash flooding. This included multiple long track tornadoes. Central Kentucky saw 18 tornadoes that injured 96 and killed 18. An additional death occurred in a flash flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The National Weather Service in Louisville surveyed a tornadic supercell over the course of 6 days in Warren County which directly struck Bowling Green. The tornado first touched down in rural southwestern Warren County just south of the intersection of Wimpee Smith Road and Petros Browning Rd. It tracked to the northeast for approximately 26 miles before entering Edmonson County. The tornado continued approximately 3.6 miles into Edmonson before dissipating at 0138 CST. At the tornado's beginning in Warren County, the tornado twisted, snapped, topped and uprooted softwood and hardwood trees. The tornado was about 200 yards wide, with EF1 winds of 90 mph. Aerial photography confirmed the tornado was continuous in this rugged area of southwest Warren County. The tornado increased to EF2, between 120 and 125 mph, doing major damage to several older barns along Tommy Smith Road. It threw a 1700 pound cattle trailer, 300 yards into a creek ravine.The NWS drone showed a distinct narrow main funnel within the larger funnel. This 30 to 35 yard funnel was clearly seen scouring the corn field and produced the most concentrated damage. The narrow funnel crossed Browning Rd and hit a well constructed house. The only major part of the house that survived was an interior bathroom and hallway. Winds were estimated at 135 mph, and areas outside the narrow funnel had damage of 100 mph, and the entire overall width was 250 yards wide. The survey team found extensive tree damage along Van Meter Rd and Fuqua Rd and aerial photography confirmed the tornado was continuous in this rugged, mainly forested area. The tornado did minor roof damage to some homes along Blue Level Road with winds of 86 to 90 mph but did more substantial roof and side damage to several barns with winds of 90 to 95 mph. Based on drone technology, there appeared to be two distinct areas of damage, and likely had a smaller satellite tornado. There was extensive roof damage to the Zomi Agape fellowship center with insulation thrown both downwind and on the upwind side of the building. The tornado increased in speed when it was over Old Tramm Rd by Rembrandt Court and Powell Road. One house on Rembrandt Court was knocked off its foundation by the garage attachment and slid about 15 feet. Other homes were knocked down to just interior bathrooms and hallways remaining, but there were some foundation construction concerns. EF2 winds of 130 to 135 mph were evidenced in this area. Several houses were knocked down to the foundation, but there were foundation construction concerns. In addition, farm equipment from a barn on the right side of Powell St was thrown directly into homes on the left side of Powell Rd. The survey team found significant house damage to dozens of homes in the Creekwood subdivision. This included exterior collapsed walls, roofs blown off, foundations severely compromised, garages blown in, insulation blown on all four sides of houses, and garages severely damaged or destroyed. In fact, they were dozens of double garages damaged, where one garage door blew in and the other garage door blew out. There were hundreds of powerlines and snapped power poles down throughout the county. Trees were uprooted snapped and twisted facing in all directions. Dozens of cars were flipped, twisted, turned, and thrown into homes. 2 x 4s were thrown into the ground, like missiles. Several splintered boards were impaled into vehicle windshields, tires, and along the hood grills. Most of the damage was rated EF2 from 115 to 135 mph except for 8 homes near Mossy Creek. The survey team brought in engineers from WKU to look at 8 homes, which were wiped down to the foundation from Moss Creek to Mossy Stone. Engineers helped in determining winds speeds were 160 mph for these houses, a high EF3 rating. Tragically, several fatalities occurred in the subdivision area. The tornado was 250 yards wide in Creekwood, but increased to about 350 yards wide before crossing Veterans Parkway. The tornado crossed the William Natcher Parkway and hit large townhouses along Veterans Parkway. There were numerous windows shattered and some roof damage. One of the town houses was shifted off the foundation, but there were no bricks or other support on it. The tornado crossed Russellville Rd hitting many businesses. At Royal Motor Cars, several storage buildings were destroyed, major loss of roof panels at Cabreras Mexican restaurant and an auto parts store. At Plumbers Supply company at 2321 Russellville Rd. The garage was blown in and collapsed. The main building had a shifted foundation, and a partial collapse of some exterior cinderblock walls, tractors and trailers were twisted and flipped, and there was numerous power poles snapped. The Shell gas station had major damage to service station canopy and store, as well as walls of an Enterprise car rental. The tornado increased to quarter mile wide and went from EF2 of 130 mph, from Royal Motorcars to AutoZone, and then decreased to EF2, 115-120 mph and narrowed to 1/8th of a mile with major tree and roof damage along Lealand Street, Cedar Ridge, and University Drive. A fully loaded dumpster was thrown 250 yards. At Russell Road and Springhill Avenue, a Marathon gas station had its pumps destroyed, and most of the exterior walls were destroyed. The tornado missed Western Kentucky University by 225 yards, but debris was thrown all over the campus including some impaled debris into buildings. The tornado went along 31W including doing significant damage to roof at Bobas lounge, a liquor store, and a smoke shop. This was estimated to be 110 to 120 mph winds, and tornado width decreased to 250 yards by Walgreens and Taco Bell. The tornado, appeared to be slightly elevated, doing mainly tree damage, power poles, and house roofing and siding along Magnolia Ave and Nutwood St. It crossed Lehman, went along Covington, with wind speeds mainly of 95 to 110 mph. The owner of 708 Nutwood said, your warning saved our lives, as our house was violently shaking, but we sought shelter and lived. Much of the tree damage was facing from the northeast to the northwest. The tornado paralleled Cemetery Rd doing roof and gutter damage along with power lines and tree damage. The tornadoes speed and winds increased along Cherokee Dr. with roofs removed and large healthy hardwood trees uprooted. The width increased to 300 yards and speeds to 105 mph with width of 225 yards. The narrow 175 yard funnel, hit the Indian Hills golf course, twisting, snapping, and topping numerous pines and cedars with winds speeds of 86 to 90 mph. The tornado then crossed the Barren River and increased in speed along Old Porter Pike to EF2, between 111 and 120 mph. Huge diameter hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted, including several very tall oak trees. There was also extensive roof damage to some well built homes. It weakened as it approached exit 28, doing EF1 damage of 90-95 mph to Hucks gas station and damaged a very tall Wendys sign. On the north side of 31 W, a fully loaded 18 wheeler facing west, was knocked over and was dragged 15 yards to a northwesterly directly. Winds were increased to EF2, of 115 mph. At the Corvette plant there was significant roof damage, with metal sheeting, insulation, HVAC units, and other debris thrown hundreds of yards downwind. Light poles in the parking lot were snapped, One of the security checkpoints at the Corvette plant was totally destroyed with large sections of the building being thrown several hundred yards, and weighing over 100 pounds, striking several vehicles. Winds were mainly in the 110 to 120 mph range. The tornado continued to parallel I 65, just west of the interstate. It struck several homes at Bristow Rd and Friendship Rd. Most of the damage was done to roofs siding and gutters and destroyed a well- built greenhouse. Numerous power poles and lines were down and the debris pattern was facing from southeasterly, all the way to northwesterly. There was some barn and tree damage near Kelly Road and the CSX railroad crossing. Winds were 85 to 90 mph and width of 200 yards. The tornado really increased across the TransPark at Exit 30. A few metal building structures at the peak intensity of the tornado sustained heavy damage. The middle building totally collapsed. Analysis showed that building was well constructed, but the shearing force from the intense tornado ripped the metal frame from the anchoring plates of the building. Analysis of the third building showed the tornado had weakened some at this point, down to EF2 levels. The WSR-8D radar showed a Tornadic Debris Signature downstream of this area, which was lofted to around 18 kft, right at the high end of EF3 of 165 mph. The tornado weakened further downstream as it caused roofing and siding damage to several structures and tree damage into southeast Edmonson County. Civil Air Patrol imagery helped identify the end point of this tornado.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A violent EF-4 tornado began in far northwest Tennessee, and moved across western Kentucky, resulting in dozens of lost lives and a swath of destruction. The tornado was on the ground for 128 miles within the NWS Paducah forecast area, and the total path length was about 165 miles from Obion County, TN to Breckinridge County, KY. Another long-track EF-3 tornado started in Dyer County, TN, and traveled about 125 miles through northwest Tennessee and into Christian and Todd Counties in western Kentucky. A strong upper-level trough over the western Plains induced a deepening surface low that tracked northeast across the Iowa/Illinois border. A very strong and deep southwest wind flow brought moist and unstable air into the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Record high temperatures were recorded, including a high of 73 at Paducah. The combination of very strong winds aloft, unseasonably warm conditions, and a strong low pressure system were ideal for this tornado outbreak.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This long-track EF-3 tornado began in western Tennessee near Dyersburg (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Western). It crossed from Stewart County, Tennessee into Christian County in the secured area of the Fort Campbell military reservation (see Storm Data, Tennessee, Central for the Stewart County portion of the track). The tornado passed only about half a mile southeast of the community of La Fayette on its way northeast across Interstate 24 and Fort Campbell Boulevard (U.S. Highway 41). Between La Fayette and I-24, several homes were destroyed (DI 2, DOD 6). The homes suffered complete destruction of the roof and/or attic. The walls were often damaged but remained standing. One house was moved from its foundation (DI 2, DOD 5). The occupants of the houses took shelter and generally escaped serious injury. A mobile home was destroyed (DI 3, DOD 9). A church sustained steeple damage. Significant damage occurred to the silos and irrigation system of a farm, where damage was estimated near 1 million dollars. A mile's worth of power poles were snapped on Fort Campbell Boulevard (U.S. 41) just one to two miles north of the I-24 interchange (DI 24, DOD 4). After crossing U.S. 41, the tornado struck Pembroke, where more significant structural damage occurred. A single-wide mobile home was destroyed (DI 3, DOD 9). The mobile home was not tied down. One person was injured at this site. At least one other mobile home was destroyed. Two barns were destroyed (DI 1, DOD 8). Roofs were completely removed from two houses. Elsewhere along the path east of Fort Campbell Boulevard, farm outbuildings and farm equipment were damaged or destroyed. The tornado was rated EF-2 in Christian County. Several damage sites were assigned a wind speed estimate of 125 mph, the highest in the county. The average path width in Christian County was about a mile, though it narrowed to about three-quarters of a mile toward the end of its life after crossing Highway 41. The tornado continued northeast of Pembroke before entering Todd County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A highly-sheared environment combined with increasing instability produced numerous tornadic thunderstorms. Severe parameters were supportive of significant and long-track supercells, prompting the issuance of a rare High Risk Convective Outlook from the Storm Prediction Center for portions of Central Alabama.||A total of 10 tornado tracks were surveyed in Central Alabama. This included 4 EF3 tornadoes, 3 EF2 tornadoes, and 3 EF1 tornadoes. Damage was significant along the paths of the most intense tornadoes and, unfortunately, injuries and fatalities occurred. |Some storms were cyclic, meaning multiple tornadoes were produced by the same storm. The most impressive tornado of the event was the long-track tornado that traveled nearly 80 miles from Hale County to Shelby County. This ranked as the seventh longest single tornado track in the state of Alabama.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in northern Shelby County and determined that it was consistent with an EF3 tornado, with maximum winds near 140 mph.||This tornado originated in Bibb County and crossed into Shelby County along Shades Creek west of River Road.  The tornado traveled northeast in a wooded area along the Cahaba River, paralleling County Highway 13. As the tornado moved into Helena, it caused shingle damage to several homes in the neighborhoods near Old Cahaba Parkway and Hillsboro Parkway. A house that was under construction also collapsed. The tornado intensified again as it crossed Buck Creek near Old Town Helena, snapping numerous trees and causing roof damage. A few homes near Cunningham Drive suffered partial roof loss. The tornado weakened as it crossed New Hope Mountain near Pelham High School, but intensified to EF2 intensity along Crosscreek Trail and Wilderness Road in Pelham. Roofs were removed from four homes with collapse of an exterior wall on two of them, with many other homes suffering varying degrees of roof damage. The tornado also caused several trees to fall on homes in the Chandalar neighborhood. The tornado weakened somewhat by the time it crossed Highway 31 but still damaged the roofs of several businesses and mobile homes while uprooting trees. It began to strengthen again after crossing Interstate 65, paralleling Highway 119 through the south side of Indian Springs Village and far northern portions of Oak Mountain State Park. It continued to uproot or snap numerous trees and continued to cause roof damage to residences. Pockets of EF2 damage were found in neighborhoods south of Heardmont Park and near Oak Mountain Elementary and Intermediate Schools, with significant damage to residences from falling trees and partial roof loss. Significant timber damage with some damage to structures was also noted near the lakes at the north gate to Oak Mountain State Park. The most significant structural damage along the path occurred in the Eagle Point neighborhood just before Highway 280. Several homes suffered complete roof loss, a couple homes suffered collapse of exterior walls, and all walls collapsed for one home on Eagle Valley Drive. The majority of the other homes in the path in this neighborhood suffered varying degrees of roof damage, with numerous trees snapped. After crossing Highway 280, the tornado continued to uproot numerous trees as it moved over Oak Mountain. It caused roof damage along Highland View Drive and in the Highland Lakes neighborhood, including complete roof loss to a residence on Grove Park Way. Varying degrees of roof damage also occurred in the Greystone Farms neighborhood, with significant roof loss on several homes. The tornado crossed Dunnavant Valley Road and caused significant timber damage at Shoal Creek Country Club, and complete roof loss for another residence. The tornado then moved into a wooded area as it crossed Double Oak Mountain, continuing to uproot numerous trees. It crossed Highway 25 near Vandiver and then began to parallel Shelby County Highway 43, causing roof damage to residences and completely destroying a manufactured home on Crabapple Lane. The tornado crossed into St. Clair County near Wolf Creek Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado continued northeast, and the first signs of EF-2 damage were observed near Johnston and Hollis Roads. The tornado then crossed I-35E where it struck 3 semis and one cargo van. Three injuries occurred in this location. Next, the tornado struck a scrap metal yard on the east side of I-35E and moved on to damage homes and electrical towers near and along HWY 77 and Butler Ln. EF-2 damage was also observed in this area, in particular to one home. Maximum estimated winds were 120 mph, and there were 5 additional injuries in this area. The tornado tracked farther east, did EF-2 damage to one home on FM 55, and then crossed FM 55 and dissipated.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As it moved northward, Ida began transitioning to a strong mid-latitude cyclone with pronounced frontal features, but with continued tropical moisture. On a regional level, the remnants of Ida became one of the most severe natural disasters in US history, due to a combination of several tornadoes, some of them strong, as well as catastrophic flooding over a large and densely populated area. The severe weather threat unfolded as the system's developing warm front lifted northward from the Delmarva region into Pennsylvania and New Jersey. South of the warm front, partial clearing and moderate to strong instability developed. Meanwhile, very strong shear and forcing, along with tropical moisture, were present within the warm sector.

Several short-wave troughs became negatively tilted as each one traversed across Texas and towards Alabama. This resulted in a single hail event one Monday, March 15, and significant tornado outbreak on Wednesday, March 17. Many supercells began to develop across Central Alabama by midday Wednesday and continued into the evening hours before a squall line moved through the state. Sufficient instability and strong wind shear produced conditions favorable for tornadoes to develop.

The tornado first touched down near Water Avenue just south of State Road 14, initially producing minor tree damage. The tornado quickly intensified snapping and uprooting large stands of hardwood trees as it moved into the Burnsville community. Near State Road 14 and County Road 871, a well built home sustained structural damage including the loss of a carport, roof damage, broken windows, and partial loss of one wall structure. An unanchored manufactured home next door was completely destroyed with the remaining contents blown across the road and scattered over 100 yards. A vehicle at this residence was rolled and sustained damage. The tornado continued to move rather slowly off to the northeast causing additional trees to fall. Several additional homes along the path sustained structural damage of mainly roof uplift and loss of shingles. Another manufactured home with some anchoring was rolled and blown apart on the north side of State Road 14. There were two occupants inside the home who were sheltering. They survived and crawled out with minor injuries. Farther northeast along State Road 14, a two story home sustained structural damage along with additional damage from falling trees. They were very large hardwood trees snapped near the base. A motorist trying to evade the tornado attempted to take shelter here and narrowly missed a large falling tree. At this point the tornado was likely at its widest reaching nearly 1000 yards. The tornado crossed State Road 14 moving into a mostly forested area producing significant tree damage before crossing County Road 261. Here a wide swath of trees and power lines were downed. The tornado finally weakened and lifted before reaching County Road 880.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several short-wave troughs became negatively tilted as each one traversed across Texas and towards Alabama. This resulted in a single hail event one Monday, March 15, and significant tornado outbreak on Wednesday, March 17. Many supercells began to develop across Central Alabama by midday Wednesday and continued into the evening hours before a squall line moved through the state. Sufficient instability and strong wind shear produced conditions favorable for tornadoes to develop. The event consisted of twenty-one tornadoes in the NWS Birmingham forecast area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> National Weather Service meteorologists surveyed damage in northeastern Dallas County and determined that it was consistent with an EF2 tornado, with maximum winds near 115 mph.  The tornado first touched down near Water Avenue just south of State Road 14, initially producing minor tree damage. The tornado quickly intensified snapping and uprooting large stands of hardwood trees as it moved into the Burnsville community. Near State Road 14 and County Road 871, a well built home sustained structural damage including the loss of a carport, roof damage, broken windows, and partial loss of one wall structure. An unanchored manufactured home next door was completely destroyed with the remaining contents blown across the road and scattered over 100 yards. A vehicle at this residence was rolled and sustained damage. The tornado continued to move rather slowly off to the northeast causing additional trees to fall. Several additional homes along the path sustained structural damage of mainly roof uplift and loss of shingles. Another manufactured home with some anchoring was rolled and blown apart on the north side of State Road 14. There were two occupants inside the home who were sheltering. They survived and crawled out with minor injuries. Farther northeast along State Road 14, a two story home sustained structural damage along with additional damage from falling trees. They were very large hardwood trees snapped near the base. A motorist trying to evade the tornado attempted to take shelter here and narrowly missed a large falling tree. At this point the tornado was likely at its widest reaching nearly 1000 yards. The tornado crossed State Road 14 moving into a mostly forested area producing significant tree damage before crossing County Road 261. Here a wide swath of trees and power lines were downed. The tornado finally weakened and lifted before reaching County Road 880.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Claudette was declared a Tropical Storm and made landfall in southeast Louisiana during the early morning hours of June 19th. Claudette then turned northeast across southeast Mississippi and across south central Alabama during the morning on Saturday June 19th.||Tropical Storm Claudette produced frequent tropical storm-force wind gusts across coastal Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle. A few areas of the coast, such as Dauphin Island, Fort Morgan, and the Okaloosa Island Fishing Pier recorded a brief period of sustained minimal tropical storm-force winds.||The highest wind gusts were associated with strong to severe thunderstorms that developed well east of the center of Claudette. These storms most significantly impacted the western Florida Panhandle. The highest wind gust observed was 81 mph at Pensacola International Airport. A Weatherflow site in Santa Rosa Sound recorded a 70 mph wind gust, which was from the same line of storms that resulted in the Pensacola gust. This line of storms produced wind damage in parts of the Pensacola Metro, especially in Ferry Pass. Pace also experienced pockets of wind damage, including one mobile home that lost its roof||The highest winds recorded were sustained winds of 45 mph with gusts to 70 mph in Santa Rosa Sound, 58 mph with gusts to 81 mph at Pensacola Airport, 42 mph with gusts to 52 mph at Okaloosa Island fishing pier. In Mobile Bay, 40 mph with gusts to 49 mph at Buccaneer Yacht Club.||Storm surge inundation ranged from 1-3 feet above normally dry ground across southern Mobile County into Mobile Bay. This flooding resulted in the closure of a few roads, such as Shell Belt Rd in the Bayou La Batre and Coden communities and the US Highway 90 Causeway over Mobile Bay. The highest storm tide recorded was 3.67 ft MHHW at the NOS tide gauge on the Bayou La Batre bridge. In addition to the storm surge, surf heights of 6-12 feet battered the Gulf facing beaches. This impacted the west end of Dauphin Island with a portion of Bienville Blvd closed due to flooding and sand over the road. The Florida side of the Gulf Islands National Seashore was closed for several days due to flooding and sand on roads. ||Claudette produced 3 tornadoes in southwest and south central Alabama: A long track EF-2 tornado that impacted Escambia and Conecuh Counties, an EF-0 tornado in rural Covington County, and an EF-0 tornado in far southern Mobile County.||A widespread 3-6 of rain fell across coastal Alabama into the western Florida Panhandle. 6-9 of rain was recorded over parts of interior southeast MS, with a station in far western Stone County, 11 miles west of Perkinston, recording 9.43.

MLCAPE reached the 1500-2000 J/kg range by 6 PM. The wind field was impressive with plenty of vertical wind shear needed for organized thunderstorms. Effective 0-1 km storm-relative helicity values ranged from 300-400 m2/s2 with effective bulk shear values of 70 knots - more than sufficient to support discrete supercells in the warm sector ahead of the cold front.||The first supercell developed in central Arkansas and tracked into northeast Arkansas producing a few weak tornadoes initially before intensifying across eastern Craighead and Mississippi Counties and killing two people. The tornado eventually strengthened into an EF-4 while moving through the Missouri Bootheel, resulting in 2 direct and one indirect fatality in Pemiscot County. The tornado then tracked across the Mississippi River into northwest Tennessee, producing an additional 4 fatalities near Reelfoot Lake. This tornado lifted for a brief time in Obion County, reorganized, and then moved into Kentucky. All told, the mesocyclone tracked for over 300 miles and was producing tornadoes for over 250 miles. This storm was responsible for at least 9 fatalities and many injuries in the NWS Memphis CWA along with millions of dollars of damage. ||As the initial supercell was crossing the state line into Kentucky, a string of supercells was moving into eastern Arkansas. A few brief tornadoes produced minor damage near Cash in western Craighead County and in the Fisher area of western Poinsett County. As the dominant supercell moved into eastern Poinsett County, the mesocyclone quickly intensified and the storm produced an EF-2 tornado in Trumann with several injuries and widespread damage. ||A new supercell developed in Mississippi County causing straight-line wind damage initially. This supercell intensified as it crossed the Mississippi River and produced another long-track tornado starting in Dyer County,  Tennessee. This tornado tracked east-northeast across northwest Tennessee into Henry County, and eventually into Kentucky. This tornado was rated EF-3 and resulted in several injuries with Kenton and Dresden, Tennessee being the hardest hit. ||The convection eventually evolved into a QLCS as it moved east. A mesovortex developed south of I-40 near Jackson that resulted in 3 tornadoes across eastern Madison, Henderson, and Decatur Counties including an EF-2. Non-tornadic storms moved across the Memphis metropolitan area, producing straight-line wind damage as a mesovortex moved through the city. A fatality was reported in Shelby County after a large tree fell on a home in South Memphis. Later that night, an EF-1 tornado occurred in Prentiss County before the severe weather threat began to wind down around 6 AM on December 11, 2021. ||In total, there were 18 tornadoes across the NWS Memphis CWA.

MLCAPE reached the 1500-2000 J/kg range by 6 PM. The wind field was impressive with plenty of vertical wind shear needed for organized thunderstorms. Effective 0-1 km storm-relative helicity values ranged from 300-400 m2/s2 with effective bulk shear values of 70 knots - more than sufficient to support discrete supercells in the warm sector ahead of the cold front.||The first supercell developed in central Arkansas and tracked into northeast Arkansas producing a few weak tornadoes initially before intensifying across eastern Craighead and Mississippi Counties and killing two people. The tornado eventually strengthened into an EF-4 while moving through the Missouri Bootheel, resulting in 2 direct and one indirect fatality in Pemiscot County. The tornado then tracked across the Mississippi River into northwest Tennessee, producing an additional 4 fatalities near Reelfoot Lake. This tornado lifted for a brief time in Obion County, reorganized, and then moved into Kentucky. All told, the mesocyclone tracked for over 300 miles and was producing tornadoes for over 250 miles. This storm was responsible for at least 9 fatalities and many injuries in the NWS Memphis CWA along with millions of dollars of damage. ||As the initial supercell was crossing the state line into Kentucky, a string of supercells was moving into eastern Arkansas. A few brief tornadoes produced minor damage near Cash in western Craighead County and in the Fisher area of western Poinsett County. As the dominant supercell moved into eastern Poinsett County, the mesocyclone quickly intensified and the storm produced an EF-2 tornado in Trumann with several injuries and widespread damage. ||A new supercell developed in Mississippi County causing straight-line wind damage initially. This supercell intensified as it crossed the Mississippi River and produced another long-track tornado starting in Dyer County,  Tennessee. This tornado tracked east-northeast across northwest Tennessee into Henry County, and eventually into Kentucky. This tornado was rated EF-3 and resulted in several injuries with Kenton and Dresden, Tennessee being the hardest hit. ||The convection eventually evolved into a QLCS as it moved east. A mesovortex developed south of I-40 near Jackson that resulted in 3 tornadoes across eastern Madison, Henderson, and Decatur Counties including an EF-2. Non-tornadic storms moved across the Memphis metropolitan area, producing straight-line wind damage as a mesovortex moved through the city. A fatality was reported in Shelby County after a large tree fell on a home in South Memphis. Later that night, an EF-1 tornado occurred in Prentiss County before the severe weather threat began to wind down around 6 AM on December 11, 2021. ||In total, there were 18 tornadoes across the NWS Memphis CWA.

MLCAPE reached the 1500-2000 J/kg range by 6 PM. The wind field was impressive with plenty of vertical wind shear needed for organized thunderstorms. Effective 0-1 km storm-relative helicity values ranged from 300-400 m2/s2 with effective bulk shear values of 70 knots - more than sufficient to support discrete supercells in the warm sector ahead of the cold front.||The first supercell developed in central Arkansas and tracked into northeast Arkansas producing a few weak tornadoes initially before intensifying across eastern Craighead and Mississippi Counties and killing two people. The tornado eventually strengthened into an EF-4 while moving through the Missouri Bootheel, resulting in 2 direct and one indirect fatality in Pemiscot County. The tornado then tracked across the Mississippi River into northwest Tennessee, producing an additional 4 fatalities near Reelfoot Lake. This tornado lifted for a brief time in Obion County, reorganized, and then moved into Kentucky. All told, the mesocyclone tracked for over 300 miles and was producing tornadoes for over 250 miles. This storm was responsible for at least 9 fatalities and many injuries in the NWS Memphis CWA along with millions of dollars of damage. ||As the initial supercell was crossing the state line into Kentucky, a string of supercells was moving into eastern Arkansas. A few brief tornadoes produced minor damage near Cash in western Craighead County and in the Fisher area of western Poinsett County. As the dominant supercell moved into eastern Poinsett County, the mesocyclone quickly intensified and the storm produced an EF-2 tornado in Trumann with several injuries and widespread damage. ||A new supercell developed in Mississippi County causing straight-line wind damage initially. This supercell intensified as it crossed the Mississippi River and produced another long-track tornado starting in Dyer County,  Tennessee. This tornado tracked east-northeast across northwest Tennessee into Henry County, and eventually into Kentucky. This tornado was rated EF-3 and resulted in several injuries with Kenton and Dresden, Tennessee being the hardest hit. ||The convection eventually evolved into a QLCS as it moved east. A mesovortex developed south of I-40 near Jackson that resulted in 3 tornadoes across eastern Madison, Henderson, and Decatur Counties including an EF-2. Non-tornadic storms moved across the Memphis metropolitan area, producing straight-line wind damage as a mesovortex moved through the city. A fatality was reported in Shelby County after a large tree fell on a home in South Memphis. Later that night, an EF-1 tornado occurred in Prentiss County before the severe weather threat began to wind down around 6 AM on December 11, 2021. ||In total, there were 18 tornadoes across the NWS Memphis CWA.
