Wind gusts were estimated between 60 and 105 miles an hour during the event and these gusts produced extensive wind damage throughout the entire area, similar to F0 and F1 tornado damage.  The American Red Cross estimated that at least 2500 homes were damaged and some destroyed.  Major electrical transmission lines were down in Tuscaloosa and Fayette Counties.

One person was injured when an 18-wheel truck was blown over on Interstate 65.  Two people sustained minor injuries when a tree fell on a doctor's office building.  Wind gust of 68 mph were reported at the Birmingham International Airport.  Wind gusts of 99 mph were measured at the grandstand level of Legion Field.  Wind gusts of 80 mph or more occurred on Red Mountain.  Area officials estimated that a very large percentage of county roads were temporarily closed due to downed trees.  Many more trees fell on automobiles, homes,  and businesses causing major damage.  Legion Field sustained damage to the large video screen used for replays at the professional football games.  Two private aircraft at the Birmingham International Airport were damaged.  The roof was torn off a portion of Riley Elementary School in southwest Birmingham.  The storms also sheared roofs off buildings and broke several windows.  Hail up to the size of golf balls was also reported with these storms.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 400K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The cold front from the previous storm did not move all that far to the south of Iowa.  As a result, warm and moist air was able to move north into Iowa rapidly.  A warm front lifted into southern Iowa during the late afternoon hours, sending temperatures into the 80s over parts of southern Iowa.  Dew point temperatures jumped into the low to mid 60s.  The atmosphere became very unstable with thunderstorms developing along the front.  Most of the storms were associated with the warm front itself,  though  a mesoscale feature moved along the front setting the stage for an additional like of thunderstorms that developed north to south in south central Iowa.  The main feature with the storms was hail.  There were numerous reports of hail ranging from nickel size up to golf ball size.  Several of the storms had well developed meso circulations associated with them.  A few tornadoes resulted.  Two of the tornadoes were very small and only touched down briefly in Tama and Dallas Counties.  The other tornadoes were stronger.  One tornado touched down in Decatur County near Leon.  Two people were injured, one requiring hospitalization, as a mobile home was overturned by the gust front ahead of the storm itself.  The second of the stronger tornadoes moved through Adams County.  A trailer house was overturned and the roofs were removed from two sheds on a farm northeast of Mt. Etna.  Thunderstorms produced very heavy rainfall of one to two inches per hour over Ringgold County.  Total rainfall approached 4 inches in less than 3 hours as storms repeatedly moved across the same areas.  The rain caused flash flooding in the county.  In one instance, Lotts Creek overtopped a road southeast of Mt. Ayr, causing nearly $50,000 in damage as the road washed out.   As the storms moved through Decatur County, lightning stuck a house in Garde Grove.  The house was set on fire, but it was not detected for several hours after the lightning strike.  The house was destroyed and completely burned to the ground.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The wind storm moved into western Alabama around 141 PM and exited the eastern counties around 438 PM.  Wind gusts were estimated between 60 and 105 miles an hour during the event and these gusts produced extensive wind damage throughout the entire area, similar to F0 and F1 tornado damage.  The American Red Cross estimated that at least 2500 homes were damaged and some destroyed.  Major electrical transmission lines were down in Tuscaloosa and Fayette Counties.  Alabama Power estimated that at least 400,000 homes and businesses were initially without power, which is one third of their total customers.  According to Alabama Power, this event ranked as the third highest ever for power outages in the state of Alabama.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Tuscaloosa County reported numerous trees and power lines blown down countywide.  Many of the fallen trees caused roads to be closed temporarily.  Numerous homes were damaged.  Wind gusts of 80 mph were measured in Northport and the Tuscaloosa Airport had 60 mph winds.  Numerous funnel cloud reports were received throughout the county.  One man was injured when a tree fell on his automobile on Highway 43.  One 18-wheel truck was overturned on a bridge over the Black Warrior River.  Several businesses reported broken windows.  One firefighter was injured in Northport when a tree fell on him.  This event occurred as the firefighter was cleaning up debris.  Quarter size hail was also reported with these storms.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These winds, at time accompanied by very large hail,  damaged the roofs of homes and blew down power lines between Round Rock and Pfleugerville.   The large hail further damaged homes and broke windows in houses and vehicles.  Nearly 300 mobile homes were damaged by the winds.  Damage was also reported to the doors of a large theater complex in Pfleugerville.

The cold front from the previous storm did not move all that far to the south of Iowa.  As a result, warm and moist air was able to move north into Iowa rapidly.  A warm front lifted into southern Iowa during the late afternoon hours, sending temperatures into the 80s over parts of southern Iowa.  Dew point temperatures jumped into the low to mid 60s.  The atmosphere became very unstable with thunderstorms developing along the front.  Most of the storms were associated with the warm front itself,  though  a mesoscale feature moved along the front setting the stage for an additional like of thunderstorms that developed north to south in south central Iowa.  The main feature with the storms was hail.  There were numerous reports of hail ranging from nickel size up to golf ball size.  Several of the storms had well developed meso circulations associated with them.  A few tornadoes resulted.  Two of the tornadoes were very small and only touched down briefly in Tama and Dallas Counties.  The other tornadoes were stronger.  One tornado touched down in Decatur County near Leon.  Two people were injured, one requiring hospitalization, as a mobile home was overturned by the gust front ahead of the storm itself.  The second of the stronger tornadoes moved through Adams County.  A trailer house was overturned and the roofs were removed from two sheds on a farm northeast of Mt. Etna.  Thunderstorms produced very heavy rainfall of one to two inches per hour over Ringgold County.  Total rainfall approached 4 inches in less than 3 hours as storms repeatedly moved across the same areas.  The rain caused flash flooding in the county.  In one instance, Lotts Creek overtopped a road southeast of Mt. Ayr, causing nearly $50,000 in damage as the road washed out.   As the storms moved through Decatur County, lightning stuck a house in Garde Grove.  The house was set on fire, but it was not detected for several hours after the lightning strike.  The house was destroyed and completely burned to the ground.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Intense surface low pressure formed over western Kansas with a central pressure by sunrise on the 11th of 977 Mb.  The weather situation was very dynamic with 500 Mb winds over 100 kts and a very sharp dry punch clearly visible on the satellite pictures.  During the day the warm front that extended east from the low reached into southern Iowa, then extended eastward.  There were two things that occurred during the day.  The first was a very strong supercell that formed over northern Missouri during the morning.  This storm lifted north-northeast at about 50 kts into Iowa, producing a long track tornado with a path extending nearly all the way to Des Moines.  During the afternoon the warm front surged north with the northeast progression of the surface dry line.  Dew points rose into the mid 60s to the south of the warm front across much of the southeast half to two thirds of Iowa.  Surface temperatures in these areas reached the 60s north, with 70s south.  With the atmosphere primed, the dry line began to move into Iowa.  Dew point temperatures behind the dry line were in the 30s with southwest winds of 30 to 50 MPH.  A broken squall line formed on the nose of the dry punch and became severe quickly.  The storm cells themselves were not all that large, but nearly every cell along the line did carry a mesoscale circulation.  There were several tornado touchdowns as the line lifted north as well.  The primary severe weather during this even was the tornadic nature of it.  There were reports of wind and hail, but everything considered these reports were pretty scattered.  There were very few reports of wind and hail with the first supercell as it lifted north out of Missouri.  One inch diameter hail was reported in Ringgold County east of Redding.  Reports of winds and hail were more frequent with the second line of thunderstorms.  There were numerous reports of hail up to marble size with this line, however there were not all that many reports of hail larger than that.  A few reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail were received from Marion and Polk Counties.  The most significant hail occurred in northeast Iowa in Butler County.  Golf ball size hail fell in the town of Parkersburg as the line passed over the city.  There were more reports of wind with the second round.  Nearly all locations reported winds of at least 50 MPH as the line passed overhead.  Scattered reports of winds of 70 to 85 MPH were received.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County as high winds downed power lines and downed outbuildings north of Ogden.  The greatest wind damage occurred over northeast Iowa in Black Hawk and Franklin Counties.  A building was blown off of its foundation and onto an adjacent road southwest of Hampton in Franklin County.  A roof of a barn was damaged and a grain wagon was tipped over northwest of Hampton.  Roof and house damage was reported over parts of Black Hawk County as well.  Five injuries occurred in Warren County at Carlisle when winds of around 65 MPH toppled a school bus.  Twenty one children were on board the bus when it overturned with 5 treated for minor injuries.  Spotty damage was reported around the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.   Several tornadoes occurred with this system.  The most significant tornado entered southern Iowa around mid day.  This  tornado reached minimal F3 intensity just east of Mt. Ayr (Ringgold County).  Property damage is estimated at over $500,000 in Ringgold county alone. Across the Des Moines area of responsibility, at least 15 homes were destroyed, and 60 residences were damaged as around a dozen tornadoes touched down.  A supercell thunderstorm moved north from Missouri into southern Iowa late in the morning of April 11.  The storm produced a tornado in northern Missouri and crossed into Iowa in Ringgold County. The storm, and tornado, moved north through Ringgold County with a continuous damage path half way through the county.   The damage path continued north through northern Ringgold County, southeast Union County and into northwest Clarke County.  In this area, the path was not continuous.  Based on damage reports, the tornado continued to produce occasional damage in Madison County.  Chaser reports indicate the tornado had a multi-vortex structure as it moved through Ringgold and Union Counties.  The last reported sighting was in northern Polk County where a brief touchdown was reported with no damage.  The storm likely produced one tornado from the Missouri border to Madison County with an intermittent damage track.   Damage in Ringgold County was severe with initial estimates around $1 million.  The county was later declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.  A second tornado briefly touched down in northern Polk County.  The touchdown in Polk County was indeed a separate tornado.  Even though the tornado was from the same parent cell, the system had occluded and was in the process of forming a new tornado as it passed over the western part of the Des Moines area.  Reports from this tornado indicate that at least 9 homes were damaged or destroyed, one business destroyed, and a school building damaged.  In addition to losses to homes, one farmstead was hit with considerable damage and some livestock damage.  A series of tornadoes formed on the heels of the supercell tornado as the dry line pushed into the state.  Most of these were brief touchdowns, however the storms were moving around 60 MPH.  Three tornadoes touched down in Boone County.  The most significant tornado touched down north of Ogden.  It produced a 3 mile long track up to 1/8 mile wide.  Farm site hit along highway P70.  Barn and grain bins destroyed, knocking out windows in house. Otherwise only minor damage to house. Debris scattered 1 mile to next farm site where there was minor damage to many buildings. Track continued north-northeast across highway E26 into the campground at Don Williams Lake. A storage building was destroyed, several trees downed, plus outhouses, picnic tables and signs were damaged. The damage track dissipated on the northeast side of the Don Williams Recreation Area.  There were several brief touchdowns with relatively minor damage in Guthrie, Greene, and Hamilton Counties.  A stronger tornado touched down in southeast Black Hawk County, causing significant damage to two homes in the La Porte City area.  The most serious tornado in terms of loss of life occurred in Wapello County.  A tornado developed in rural southern Wapello County, a mile southwest of Agency, Iowa, around 1600 CDT, on Wednesday, April 11.  The tornado path was 50 to 100 yards wide with sporadic touchdowns toward the north-northeast for the next 6 miles.    Survey responses indicated that the duration of impact at any one location was only 15 to 30 seconds as the tornado quickly moved through Agency and over farms at a 60 mph horizontal movement.   The Odd Fellows Lodge in Agency was destroyed, and over 50 residences were damaged.  Two women inside were killed, three people injured and three people had no injuries.  As the storm moved through Agency, a garage was lifted and carried about 100 meters off of its foundation.  The car inside was twisted and covered with debris.  In another incident, one house was hit by the tornado causing damage to the house.  The family dog was in the dog pen at the time.  The tornado lifted the pen and twirled it through the air.  The dog pen was deposited some distance downstream and what was truly amazing was the fact that the dog was uninjured.  Following the tornado, U.S. Highway 34 was closed for 2 hours in order to removed debris from the highway. Governor Tom Vilsack visited the area during a storm survey.  The governor spoke with Brenda Brock of the  National Weather Service, Ellen Gordon, Administrator, Iowa Emergency Management Division, emergency management personnel (fire department, law enforcement, mayor) and the public.  A proclamation for emergency disaster assistance was signed.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> School bus overturned by wind gust.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The damage was caused by a strong gust front preceding a line of early morning thunderstorms.  Wind gusts of 61 mph were measured by the ASOS unit at the Columbus airport, but winds were believed to have gusted to near 80 mph in the downtown Historic District of Columbus.  Extensive and widespread damage occurred to trees, power lines, and structures throughout the Columbus area, particular in the Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Brown Avenue areas.  Martin Luther King Boulevard, as well as Columbus thoroughfares north of Victory Drive and south of Peachtree Mall, were strewn with fallen oaks, splintered pines, and other debris, temporarily blocking traffic.  Damage consisted of 47 trees, some of which were very large, old oak trees, 17 power lines, and 20 traffic lights.  One home was badly damaged when a large oak tree fell across the roof, barely missing the occupant sleeping inside.  Damage was also reported at the Columbus RedStixx baseball park where the awning of the office was ripped off, 2 dugouts roofs were damaged, and 3 sets of bleachers were blown on to the playing field.  In addition, a firefighter on his way to a call was injured when a power line junction box was blown down and through the window of his fire truck.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Although numerous trees and power lines were blown down across the county, the most concentrated area was from Cedarcreek to Protem in southeast Taney County, where over 400 trees and power lines completely blocked county roads for more than two days. During the height of the storm, Empire District Electric had approximately 3000 customers without power for more than 18 hours, plus fire and rescue personnel had to evacuate 12 people stranded on the dock at Gage's Long Creek Marina west of Ridgedale. In addition, the boat dock at Big Bear Resort was destroyed when the wind lifted the dock off the water, overturning it and all of the boats. A fuel spill occurred at a fuel station on Highway 165 when the fuel level gauge on an above ground storage tank was broken off by the wind. More than 100 gallons of fuel poured into the secondary containment enclosure. Two homes under construction off Highway 265 west of Branson were also damaged. Injuries were relatively minor, however one woman was injured on Fruit Farm Road south of Hollister when a shed she was in blew over.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Winds exceeded 70 mph across the area, resulting in thousands of downed trees and damage to homes and businesses.  What made the storm particularly significant was the sustained strong winds causing more damage than typically experienced with a single severe wind gust.  In Oshkosh, winds of 45 to 70+ mph were recorded for 45 minutes, veering from west to north during that span.  The high winds and rough water knocked over dozens of sailboats on Lake Winnebago, sinking at least one.  The storms knocked out power to at least 100,000 customers.   The hardest hit counties included Wood, Portage, Waupaca, Waushara, southern Outagamie and Winnebago.Two youths at a coffee house in Neenah (Winnebago co.) were injured by flying glass when high winds caused a window to break.Very heavy rain in a short period of time resulted in urban flooding in Appleton.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The high winds from the storms did the most damage from the Twin Creeks area north across Inland Beach road to near US Highway 98 just northwest of Lucedale.  The damage was all facing to the west as the storms were moving around the eastern periphery of Allison.  It was estimated that  about twenty-five homes in these areas suffered some form of damage with at least ten manufactured homes damaged so bad they were deemed destroyed.  The high winds covered a large area with several trees and power lines also blown down.  The roof was taken off one two story home.  Five people suffered minor injuries during the storm.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One person was injured between Reedsburg and Baraboo when a wind-toppled tree fell on their car.  Torrential rains accompanied some of the storms, resulting in urban and small stream flooding in and around Randolph and Fox Lake in northwest Dodge County.  Three-fourths of an inch of rain fell in 25 minutes in Randolph and up to 2 inches fell around Fox Lake.  Up to 1.80 inches of rain fell in a short period of time in the Baraboo to Lake Delton area of Sauk County, resulting in urban and small stream flooding in that county.  Water depths affected roads in northeast Sauk and northwest Dodge Counties where it was reported to be 6 inches to 2 feet deep.  Lightning-initiated fires destroyed two barns on separate farms near Mifflan (Iowa Co.).Synoptically, an upper-level, short-wave trough moved through the Great Lakes region. Instability along the trough was sufficient to allow thunderstorm development.

Boats were capsized on the Navesink and Shrewsbury Rivers. About 6,000 homes and businesses lost power. The only injuries occurred in Sea Bright when the high winds tore away the outside deck off a waterfront restaurant. No serious injuries were reported. The wind damage began along the Navesink River in Red Bank and continued east following Harding and Ridge Roads into Fair Haven and Little Silver. Damage continued eastward through Rumson's County Golf Club into the Shrewsbury River to Sea Bright. Fair Haven was hit the hardest with extensive tree damage. The tree damage was similar to what happened in Colts Neck the previous year. Damage was estimated of $125,000.  About 6,000 homes and businesses lost power. All power was restored by the 29th. Damaging winds from the severe thunderstorm started in Red Bank. The winds overturned a dozen boats on trailers at the Monmouth Boat Club and overturned two sailboats in the Navesink River. A downed tree trapped two passengers after it fell on it. They were not hurt. Several roads in Fair Haven were closed through the 28th for removal In Little Silver, a house's den was destroyed by a fallen tree. Seven trees were knocked down in Rumson, one fell on a house. In Sea Bright, in addition to the restaurant losing its deck, a downed flag pole damaged two vehicles.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 125K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A cold front had slipped into the northwest part of the state and nearly bisected the state by the early evening hours.  Meanwhile, an east-northeast to west-southwest boundary was in place across the central part of the state.  The second boundary was left in place by the convection that occurred earlier in the day.  The airmass remained quite unstable during the evening with dew point temperatures in the mid 60s to around 70.  Colder air continued to slip into the state aloft with the freezing level falling just below 12,000 feet by the early evening.  Another round of thunderstorms fired to the southwest of Iowa and moved into the state during the evening.  Strong winds of 40 kts or more at the 850 mb level pushed over the top of the two boundaries over the state.  Thunderstorms developed rapidly.  This round of thunderstorms produced high winds and some hail.  Though hail was not the predominant form of severe weather with this round, most of the storms did produce at least pea to marble size hail.  Hail of nickle to near one inch in diameter was reported in Adair and Decatur Counties.  The main severe activity this time around was high winds as the storms developed into a series of small bow echoes.  High winds developed in southwest and central Iowa during the early evening.   In Adams County, high winds two 40,000 bushel grain bins were destroyed and blown across the field two miles by downburst winds east of Corning.  North of Corning high winds destroyed a grain elevator, a barn, and damaged several grain bins.  Losses were placed at $250.000.  The storms raced northeast and so did the high winds.  Most of the storms produced winds of 60 MPH or higher.    Winds of 70 MPH ripped through Warren County as one bow element moved east rapidly to the south of the Des Moines Metropolitan area.  The winds flipped over a semi tractor-trailer truck on Interstate 35 just south of Des Moines, west of Cumming.    As the bow echo advanced east, high winds damaged a trailer home in Carlisle, while the roof was blown off of an apartment building.  This was not the only strong bow echo.  Another bow segment moved into Marshall and Jasper Counties.  Winds of 65 to 75 MPH were common in these storms.  Windows were blown out of a house in Jasper County at Newton.  Winds of 70 MPH advanced east into Poweshiek County as well.  A very strong storm moved into Appanoose County during the late evening hours and tore through the county causing considerable damage.  Several mobile homes were destroyed in the town of Centerville by winds near 85 MPH.  One person was injured and was trapped in the debris.  Fortunately, the injury was minor.  A semi tractor-trailer was overturned on the north side of Centerville by the high winds.  A short time before, the storms moved through the Numa area with the high winds completely destroying a farm house there.  It appears the winds from this event were likely a combination of microburst as well as the bow echo itself.  Farther northeast, the main area of thunderstorms that moved through central Iowa passed through the Waterloo area.  Considerable damage was reported in the Waterloo and Cedar Falls areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A strong area of convection passed through the state during the morning hours.   Though there was only brief clearing, the airmass was able to recharge as winds strengthened aloft and temperatures began to cool.  An upper level disturbance moved rapidly northeast across the state, setting off another round of severe weather in the form of high winds.  A line of thunderstorms developed from north central into southwest Iowa.  Initially they were ahead of an approaching cold front, but soon outran the support of the front.  The upper level system took over changing the line into series of bow echos.  Winds of 60 MPH were first reported in Dallas County of central Iowa.  The storms raced northeast at 60 MPH or more and moved into Story County.  High winds of 60 to 80 MPH were common with these storms as they moved through.  Large trees were downed by the high winds.  One person was injured as the storms moved through Nevada in Story County.  There were several reports of outbuilding damage and damage to grain bins.  Damage was widespread in Story County.  As a result Governor Vilsack declared Story County a disaster area.  In Hardin County west of Hubbard, two barns were destroyed, killing some of the livestock contained within.  The storms continued to move northeast and caused damage to a house northwest of Frederika in Bremer County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The storm was moving to the WSW at about 20 knots.  The microburst had a measured divergent spread of 140 degrees with the left (south) edge of the debris blown to 160 degrees and the right (north) edge of the debris blown to 300 degrees.The destroyed trailer faced south and was hit from the rear by outflow winds from 340 degrees.  This wind direction was about 80 degrees from the path of the storm, implying that there was practically no translational speed added into this wind, therefore, it is thought that the trailer was destoyed by no more than a 60 mph wind.  The trailer was flipped onto its roof, then came apart, and was spread across the road and into the field to the south.  A man and his son were in the trailer at the time of the event.  The man suffered a minor neck injury. A couple of barns and a carport were destroyed as well, and several residences sustained damage ranging from shingles loosened to structural damage of a garage and outside wall.The storm cluster producing this microburst had also produced a microburst over the city of Fort Smith, Arkansas.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

During the heating of the afternoon, thunderstorms erupted in the unstable air.  The freezing level was around 15,000 feet, so hail was not a great threat.  Surface dew point temperatures were in the upper 60s to low 70s with precipitable water values around 1.75 inches.  Thunderstorms fired southwest of the Des Moines metropolitan area.  A tornado touched down in rural Madison County.  The tornado was about 60 feet wide and produced a half mile long path of damage in open country.    As the storms moved northeast they continued to intensity.  One cell dropped a tornado at the Glen Oaks Golf Course in West Des Moines, causing some minor damage there.  The tornado tracked northeast and flipped a semi tractor-trailer truck in Interstate 35 resulting in one injury.  It continued northeast and hit an apartment complex causing damage to the building and destroying an 8-car garage.  The path was more intermittent as it continued northeast into the city.  There were numerous reports of trees and power lines being downed.  The tornado lifted as the event transitioned into a high wind event.  The storms produced wind damage in Johnston as it moved through the area.  High winds of 80 to 85 MPH occurred in northern Polk and southern Story Counties before they weakened.  A grain bin was flattened, along with tree and crop damage, as the storm moved through the Elkhart area.  Just northwest of that, in Slater, high winds took the roof off of a house in southern Story County.  One person in the house was injured.  The storms continued to track northeast, eventually dropping another tornado in Butler and Bremer Counties.  The tornado had a somewhat intermittent track touching down south of Shell Rock and lifting northeast of Waverly.  For the most part the tornado tracked through corn fields there.  One farmstead was hit in Butler County.  A grain bin was destroyed and blown one quarter of a mile across a field, another was blown off its foundation, a shed was destroyed, and crops were damaged.  In Bremer County, one car and a garage were damaged along the tornadoes path.  Another farmstead was hit north of Waverly.  Part of a machine garage was destroyed and blown about 30 feet off of its foundation.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 75K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This storm exhibited very subtle bowing, but otherwise there was little to note about it's structure. Damage from this storm was limited to a residential mobile and modular home area perched on a broad hill. The homes were situated on 1 acre lots, so they were not densely packed.The damage primarily consisted of rolled and broken mobile homes. The damage area was limited to an area less than one mile in diameter. Five mobile homes were rolled and destroyed. Four mobile and modular homes sustained major roof damage. The mobile homes that were destroyed were scattered between homes which were completely undamaged. Examination of destroyed homes indicated that they were not tied down or had inadequate or no skirting at all. Homes that had plywood skirting and were tied down weathered the storm. Debris patterns provided evidence of diffluent winds, suggesting straight-line downburst winds. Five people recieved minor injuries from side being inside rolled mobile homes. Two injuries were the result of wind driven hail after escaping a destroyed mobile home.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 213K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first supercell storm moved into southwest Kalamazoo county just southwest of Schoolcraft. This storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across Kalamazoo, extreme northwest Calhoun, southeast Barry, northwest Eaton, southeast Ionia, northwest Clinton and Gratiot counties. It produced a swath of damage 2 miles wide in which thousands of trees were either broken off or uprooted, and some structural damage occurred to homes, barns and larger buildings. Much of the damage resulted from trees falling on homes. A few older homes had major structural damage when their roofs were blown off and walls knocked down. Power lines were blown down along the entire track of the storm, leaving about 15,000 people without power. Straight line winds of 60 to 70 m.p.h. were common and storm damage indicated that downbursts produced winds of 90 to 100 m.p.h. The second supercell began producing damage in Marshall, in central Calhoun county. The storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across north central Calhoun, southeast Eaton, northwest Ingham, and extreme southeast Clinton counties. This storm generally produced winds between 60 and 80 m.p.h. across Calhoun county, where it blew part of a roof off a hotel in Marshall and also uprooted trees and produced minor structural damage across the rest of the county. The storm intensified as it moved into Eaton county, where it produced straight line wind damage consistent with 90 to 110 m.p.h. winds as it crossed Narrow Lake, near Brookfield. It snapped off trees, caused structural damage to homes, and took out power lines at Narrow Lake. The storm crossed the remainder of the county and uprooted trees, downed power lines, blew a home off its foundation, and blew in garage doors that caused garage roofs to lift up and cave in. The storm damaged about 60 homes across Eaton county and caused about one million dollars worth of damage. The storm entered Ingham county and produced damage consistent with 60 to 80 m.p.h. winds. As it crossed Jolly road, a very localized downburst to 120 m.p.h. snapped 18 inch diameter power poles about 20 feet above the ground. It toppled trees in East Lansing and did minor damage to roofs. The storm blew over and damaged quonset huts utilized for storage at Michigan State Police Headquarters in East Lansing. Only minor additional damage was reported as the storm moved across extreme southeast Clinton county. The third supercell storm began near Tekonsha in south central Calhoun county. It moved northeast between 50 and 55 m.p.h. across Calhoun, northwest Jackson and Ingham county. It produced winds to 90 m.p.h. in Tekonsha where it destroyed a number of mobile homes, causing injuries to 6 people. The storm produced mainly tree damage and minor structural damage along the remainder of it's track, and also blew down a barn just north of Webberville in Ingham county. One fatality occurred 3 miles east of Maple Rapids, where a tree was blown down onto a pickup truck, killing the 46 year old Maple Rapids man who was driving.  The rest of the thunderstorms across the area blew down several trees and power lines but did not cause extensive damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first supercell storm moved into southwest Kalamazoo county just southwest of Schoolcraft. This storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across Kalamazoo, extreme northwest Calhoun, southeast Barry, northwest Eaton, southeast Ionia, northwest Clinton and Gratiot counties. It produced a swath of damage 2 miles wide in which thousands of trees were either broken off or uprooted, and some structural damage occurred to homes, barns and larger buildings. Much of the damage resulted from trees falling on homes. A few older homes had major structural damage when their roofs were blown off and walls knocked down. Power lines were blown down along the entire track of the storm, leaving about 15,000 people without power. Straight line winds of 60 to 70 m.p.h. were common and storm damage indicated that downbursts produced winds of 90 to 100 m.p.h. The second supercell began producing damage in Marshall, in central Calhoun county. The storm moved northeast at 50 to 55 m.p.h. across north central Calhoun, southeast Eaton, northwest Ingham, and extreme southeast Clinton counties. This storm generally produced winds between 60 and 80 m.p.h. across Calhoun county, where it blew part of a roof off a hotel in Marshall and also uprooted trees and produced minor structural damage across the rest of the county. The storm intensified as it moved into Eaton county, where it produced straight line wind damage consistent with 90 to 110 m.p.h. winds as it crossed Narrow Lake, near Brookfield. It snapped off trees, caused structural damage to homes, and took out power lines at Narrow Lake. The storm crossed the remainder of the county and uprooted trees, downed power lines, blew a home off its foundation, and blew in garage doors that caused garage roofs to lift up and cave in. The storm damaged about 60 homes across Eaton county and caused about one million dollars worth of damage. The storm entered Ingham county and produced damage consistent with 60 to 80 m.p.h. winds. As it crossed Jolly road, a very localized downburst to 120 m.p.h. snapped 18 inch diameter power poles about 20 feet above the ground. It toppled trees in East Lansing and did minor damage to roofs. The storm blew over and damaged quonset huts utilized for storage at Michigan State Police Headquarters in East Lansing. Only minor additional damage was reported as the storm moved across extreme southeast Clinton county. The third supercell storm began near Tekonsha in south central Calhoun county. It moved northeast between 50 and 55 m.p.h. across Calhoun, northwest Jackson and Ingham county. It produced winds to 90 m.p.h. in Tekonsha where it destroyed a number of mobile homes, causing injuries to 6 people. The storm produced mainly tree damage and minor structural damage along the remainder of it's track, and also blew down a barn just north of Webberville in Ingham county. One fatality occurred 3 miles east of Maple Rapids, where a tree was blown down onto a pickup truck, killing the 46 year old Maple Rapids man who was driving.  The rest of the thunderstorms across the area blew down several trees and power lines but did not cause extensive damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The cold front from the previous storm did not move all that far to the south of Iowa.  As a result, warm and moist air was able to move north into Iowa rapidly.  A warm front lifted into southern Iowa during the late afternoon hours, sending temperatures into the 80s over parts of southern Iowa.  Dew point temperatures jumped into the low to mid 60s.  The atmosphere became very unstable with thunderstorms developing along the front.  Most of the storms were associated with the warm front itself,  though  a mesoscale feature moved along the front setting the stage for an additional like of thunderstorms that developed north to south in south central Iowa.  The main feature with the storms was hail.  There were numerous reports of hail ranging from nickel size up to golf ball size.  Several of the storms had well developed meso circulations associated with them.  A few tornadoes resulted.  Two of the tornadoes were very small and only touched down briefly in Tama and Dallas Counties.  The other tornadoes were stronger.  One tornado touched down in Decatur County near Leon.  Two people were injured, one requiring hospitalization, as a mobile home was overturned by the gust front ahead of the storm itself.  The second of the stronger tornadoes moved through Adams County.  A trailer house was overturned and the roofs were removed from two sheds on a farm northeast of Mt. Etna.  Thunderstorms produced very heavy rainfall of one to two inches per hour over Ringgold County.  Total rainfall approached 4 inches in less than 3 hours as storms repeatedly moved across the same areas.  The rain caused flash flooding in the county.  In one instance, Lotts Creek overtopped a road southeast of Mt. Ayr, causing nearly $50,000 in damage as the road washed out.   As the storms moved through Decatur County, lightning stuck a house in Garde Grove.  The house was set on fire, but it was not detected for several hours after the lightning strike.  The house was destroyed and completely burned to the ground.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Trailer house overturned and destroyed.

The cold front from the previous storm did not move all that far to the south of Iowa.  As a result, warm and moist air was able to move north into Iowa rapidly.  A warm front lifted into southern Iowa during the late afternoon hours, sending temperatures into the 80s over parts of southern Iowa.  Dew point temperatures jumped into the low to mid 60s.  The atmosphere became very unstable with thunderstorms developing along the front.  Most of the storms were associated with the warm front itself,  though  a mesoscale feature moved along the front setting the stage for an additional like of thunderstorms that developed north to south in south central Iowa.  The main feature with the storms was hail.  There were numerous reports of hail ranging from nickel size up to golf ball size.  Several of the storms had well developed meso circulations associated with them.  A few tornadoes resulted.  Two of the tornadoes were very small and only touched down briefly in Tama and Dallas Counties.  The other tornadoes were stronger.  One tornado touched down in Decatur County near Leon.  Two people were injured, one requiring hospitalization, as a mobile home was overturned by the gust front ahead of the storm itself.  The second of the stronger tornadoes moved through Adams County.  A trailer house was overturned and the roofs were removed from two sheds on a farm northeast of Mt. Etna.  Thunderstorms produced very heavy rainfall of one to two inches per hour over Ringgold County.  Total rainfall approached 4 inches in less than 3 hours as storms repeatedly moved across the same areas.  The rain caused flash flooding in the county.  In one instance, Lotts Creek overtopped a road southeast of Mt. Ayr, causing nearly $50,000 in damage as the road washed out.   As the storms moved through Decatur County, lightning stuck a house in Garde Grove.  The house was set on fire, but it was not detected for several hours after the lightning strike.  The house was destroyed and completely burned to the ground.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Trailer house overturned and destroyed.

Despite the late hour of the day, cooler temperatures and foggy conditions, these thunderstorms began to rotate and produced several tornadoes across the area.  The first tornado developed in southwest Rooks county near Palco and lifted just south of Webster Lake.  One farmstead was hit with damage sustained to outbuildings, trees and farm equipment.  The next twister entered Rooks county from Ellis county south of Plainville.  This tornado hit a farmstead on the south side of Plainville and traveled northeast through the cemetery and then on to rural areas of eastern Rooks county.  The farmstead sustained damage to outbuildings and trees.  The home was spared from major damage.  Another weak tornado started on the south side of Plainville and traveled up US highway 183 and then northeast to a modular home manufacturing plant.  Several homes in production were damaged.  Other homes along the path had roof or window damage.  Three other tornadoes occurred in Osborne county.  The first, on the west side of the county, damaged outbuildings and trees along its 9 mile path.  A short lived tornado near the junction of US highway 24 and Kansas Highway 181 hit an abandoned gas station.  Old tanks and concrete blocks were littered about for nearly a mile to the northeast.  The last tornado in the county started southwest of Downs and traveled northeast.  It hit one farmstead on the west side of Downs causing damage to various outbuildings and farm machinery.  This twister continued northeast and entered extreme southeast Smith county and then into southwest Jewell county.  Before lifting, the tornado hit the parsonage of the Dispatch church, causing roof and wall damage to the home.  Other weak tornadoes were noted in Smith and Jewell counties with minor damage noted to power poles and trees.  Some other reports indicated that some hail and strong winds accompanied these storms.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Despite the late hour of the day, cooler temperatures and foggy conditions, these thunderstorms began to rotate and produced several tornadoes across the area.  The first tornado developed in southwest Rooks county near Palco and lifted just south of Webster Lake.  One farmstead was hit with damage sustained to outbuildings, trees and farm equipment.  The next twister entered Rooks county from Ellis county south of Plainville.  This tornado hit a farmstead on the south side of Plainville and traveled northeast through the cemetery and then on to rural areas of eastern Rooks county.  The farmstead sustained damage to outbuildings and trees.  The home was spared from major damage.  Another weak tornado started on the south side of Plainville and traveled up US highway 183 and then northeast to a modular home manufacturing plant.  Several homes in production were damaged.  Other homes along the path had roof or window damage.  Three other tornadoes occurred in Osborne county.  The first, on the west side of the county, damaged outbuildings and trees along its 9 mile path.  A short lived tornado near the junction of US highway 24 and Kansas Highway 181 hit an abandoned gas station.  Old tanks and concrete blocks were littered about for nearly a mile to the northeast.  The last tornado in the county started southwest of Downs and traveled northeast.  It hit one farmstead on the west side of Downs causing damage to various outbuildings and farm machinery.  This twister continued northeast and entered extreme southeast Smith county and then into southwest Jewell county.  Before lifting, the tornado hit the parsonage of the Dispatch church, causing roof and wall damage to the home.  Other weak tornadoes were noted in Smith and Jewell counties with minor damage noted to power poles and trees.  Some other reports indicated that some hail and strong winds accompanied these storms.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Intense surface low pressure formed over western Kansas with a central pressure by sunrise on the 11th of 977 Mb.  The weather situation was very dynamic with 500 Mb winds over 100 kts and a very sharp dry punch clearly visible on the satellite pictures.  During the day the warm front that extended east from the low reached into southern Iowa, then extended eastward.  There were two things that occurred during the day.  The first was a very strong supercell that formed over northern Missouri during the morning.  This storm lifted north-northeast at about 50 kts into Iowa, producing a long track tornado with a path extending nearly all the way to Des Moines.  During the afternoon the warm front surged north with the northeast progression of the surface dry line.  Dew points rose into the mid 60s to the south of the warm front across much of the southeast half to two thirds of Iowa.  Surface temperatures in these areas reached the 60s north, with 70s south.  With the atmosphere primed, the dry line began to move into Iowa.  Dew point temperatures behind the dry line were in the 30s with southwest winds of 30 to 50 MPH.  A broken squall line formed on the nose of the dry punch and became severe quickly.  The storm cells themselves were not all that large, but nearly every cell along the line did carry a mesoscale circulation.  There were several tornado touchdowns as the line lifted north as well.  The primary severe weather during this even was the tornadic nature of it.  There were reports of wind and hail, but everything considered these reports were pretty scattered.  There were very few reports of wind and hail with the first supercell as it lifted north out of Missouri.  One inch diameter hail was reported in Ringgold County east of Redding.  Reports of winds and hail were more frequent with the second line of thunderstorms.  There were numerous reports of hail up to marble size with this line, however there were not all that many reports of hail larger than that.  A few reports of three quarter to one inch diameter hail were received from Marion and Polk Counties.  The most significant hail occurred in northeast Iowa in Butler County.  Golf ball size hail fell in the town of Parkersburg as the line passed over the city.  There were more reports of wind with the second round.  Nearly all locations reported winds of at least 50 MPH as the line passed overhead.  Scattered reports of winds of 70 to 85 MPH were received.  Wind damage occurred in Boone County as high winds downed power lines and downed outbuildings north of Ogden.  The greatest wind damage occurred over northeast Iowa in Black Hawk and Franklin Counties.  A building was blown off of its foundation and onto an adjacent road southwest of Hampton in Franklin County.  A roof of a barn was damaged and a grain wagon was tipped over northwest of Hampton.  Roof and house damage was reported over parts of Black Hawk County as well.  Five injuries occurred in Warren County at Carlisle when winds of around 65 MPH toppled a school bus.  Twenty one children were on board the bus when it overturned with 5 treated for minor injuries.  Spotty damage was reported around the greater Des Moines metropolitan area.   Several tornadoes occurred with this system.  The most significant tornado entered southern Iowa around mid day.  This  tornado reached minimal F3 intensity just east of Mt. Ayr (Ringgold County).  Property damage is estimated at over $500,000 in Ringgold county alone. Across the Des Moines area of responsibility, at least 15 homes were destroyed, and 60 residences were damaged as around a dozen tornadoes touched down.  A supercell thunderstorm moved north from Missouri into southern Iowa late in the morning of April 11.  The storm produced a tornado in northern Missouri and crossed into Iowa in Ringgold County. The storm, and tornado, moved north through Ringgold County with a continuous damage path half way through the county.   The damage path continued north through northern Ringgold County, southeast Union County and into northwest Clarke County.  In this area, the path was not continuous.  Based on damage reports, the tornado continued to produce occasional damage in Madison County.  Chaser reports indicate the tornado had a multi-vortex structure as it moved through Ringgold and Union Counties.  The last reported sighting was in northern Polk County where a brief touchdown was reported with no damage.  The storm likely produced one tornado from the Missouri border to Madison County with an intermittent damage track.   Damage in Ringgold County was severe with initial estimates around $1 million.  The county was later declared a federal disaster area by President Bush.  A second tornado briefly touched down in northern Polk County.  The touchdown in Polk County was indeed a separate tornado.  Even though the tornado was from the same parent cell, the system had occluded and was in the process of forming a new tornado as it passed over the western part of the Des Moines area.  Reports from this tornado indicate that at least 9 homes were damaged or destroyed, one business destroyed, and a school building damaged.  In addition to losses to homes, one farmstead was hit with considerable damage and some livestock damage.  A series of tornadoes formed on the heels of the supercell tornado as the dry line pushed into the state.  Most of these were brief touchdowns, however the storms were moving around 60 MPH.  Three tornadoes touched down in Boone County.  The most significant tornado touched down north of Ogden.  It produced a 3 mile long track up to 1/8 mile wide.  Farm site hit along highway P70.  Barn and grain bins destroyed, knocking out windows in house. Otherwise only minor damage to house. Debris scattered 1 mile to next farm site where there was minor damage to many buildings. Track continued north-northeast across highway E26 into the campground at Don Williams Lake. A storage building was destroyed, several trees downed, plus outhouses, picnic tables and signs were damaged. The damage track dissipated on the northeast side of the Don Williams Recreation Area.  There were several brief touchdowns with relatively minor damage in Guthrie, Greene, and Hamilton Counties.  A stronger tornado touched down in southeast Black Hawk County, causing significant damage to two homes in the La Porte City area.  The most serious tornado in terms of loss of life occurred in Wapello County.  A tornado developed in rural southern Wapello County, a mile southwest of Agency, Iowa, around 1600 CDT, on Wednesday, April 11.  The tornado path was 50 to 100 yards wide with sporadic touchdowns toward the north-northeast for the next 6 miles.    Survey responses indicated that the duration of impact at any one location was only 15 to 30 seconds as the tornado quickly moved through Agency and over farms at a 60 mph horizontal movement.   The Odd Fellows Lodge in Agency was destroyed, and over 50 residences were damaged.  Two women inside were killed, three people injured and three people had no injuries.  As the storm moved through Agency, a garage was lifted and carried about 100 meters off of its foundation.  The car inside was twisted and covered with debris.  In another incident, one house was hit by the tornado causing damage to the house.  The family dog was in the dog pen at the time.  The tornado lifted the pen and twirled it through the air.  The dog pen was deposited some distance downstream and what was truly amazing was the fact that the dog was uninjured.  Following the tornado, U.S. Highway 34 was closed for 2 hours in order to removed debris from the highway. Governor Tom Vilsack visited the area during a storm survey.  The governor spoke with Brenda Brock of the  National Weather Service, Ellen Gordon, Administrator, Iowa Emergency Management Division, emergency management personnel (fire department, law enforcement, mayor) and the public.  A proclamation for emergency disaster assistance was signed.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Quick moving tornado, touchdown with strongest part in Agency.

The tornado traveled five miles to a point three miles eastnortheast of Kokomo. The next tornado touched down about two miles east of Columbia and traveled six miles to a point seven miles eastnortheast of Columbia. The next tornado touched down nine miles eastnortheast of Columbia and traveled into Lamar County to a point four miles northeast of Oak Grove. The final tornado produced by the supercell in the Jackson NWS County Warning Area touched down in the northwest part of the city of Hattiesburg and traveled across northern sections of Hattiesburg and then across the city of Petal. This tornado lifted about two miles east of Petal. Damage reports in Marion County are somewhat difficult to estimate because an earlier tornado affected portions of the county, and the severe thunderstorm that produced the first tornado in the county caused damage in the city of Columbia before the second tornadic storm moved into the county. Damage to homes in Marion County from the tornado is estimated at $700,000 with other damage in the county listed under separate storms. The total damage from the tornado in Lamar County is estimated to have been around $4.5 million. In Lamar County, the tornado destroyed five houses, 24 mobile homes, one business, and 17 farms. The tornado caused major damage to 33 houses, 30 mobile homes, one church, two businesses, and seven farms. Minor damage occurred to approximately 30 mobile homes, eight  apartment units, one church, two businesses, and a farm. The total damage from the tornado in Forrest County was estimated to be around $6 million. In Forrest County, the tornado tracked through populated areas of Hattiesburg and Petal. The tornado caused major damage to 112 houses, one mobile home, eight businesses, and six vehicles. Additionally, the tornado caused minor damage to 223 houses, four mobile homes, and 21 businesses. Despite the widespread damage across three counties, no serious injuries were reported in the storms.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 6M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado formed about 3 miles east of Quanah and tracked east-southeast for 8 miles before dissipating. As the tornado crossed Highway 287, a semi-truck, which pulled to the side of the road, was blown over. The driver sustained several injuries, requiring hopital care. Also nearby, 10 to 15 utility poles were either blown over or snapped in half, and a trailer house was destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 60K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The Carnaby Square shopping center was hard hit.  The tornado was reported by eye witnesses to have been nearly stationary in the parking lot for nearly 4 minutes.  During this time several automobiles including a large moving van were overtured.  A 20 by 30 foot chunk of 4 inch thick blacktop from the parking lot was torn up and thrown approximately 100 feet.  Merchandise from one of the stores was later found 25 miles to the east.  The tornado lifted before crossing U.S. Highway 25.  The tornado touched down again along Bellinger Street between 6:15 and 6:20 pm where several homes received major damage.  One duplex lost its entire roof as a mother and her two sons took shelter  on the second floor.  A mobile home used for storage was demolished.  One block over on Morgan Street several brick and framed homes lost their entire roofs.  A framed home placed on a block foundation was blown 15 feet away from the foundation. The storm lifted as if approached the Rolling Acres Subdivision.  Witnesses reported seeing two funnel clouds at this time as the storm continued moving east.  Damage was confined to large trees and some shingle damage on roofs of homes. The storm again dropped a tornado as it approached a ball park just northwest of the intersection of Kentucky Highway 192 and 80.  Three of the four teams in the park took refuge in the concession stand and the fourth team remained in the dugout where parents covered the children while laying on the ground.  One mid sized truck was tossed from the parking lot approximately 150 feet.  Fencing from both ball diamonds was blown away. The last major damage occurred at a mobile home sales lot near the intersection of Kentucky Highway 192 and the Daniel Boone Parkway.  Eight mobile homes weighing 8 to 12 tons were totaled.Emergency management officials reported that there were 10 minor injuries with the most serious being a broken arm.  Eighteen residences were destroyed, 21 received major damage while 84 received minor damage.  Twenty-six businesses suffered major damage.

This tornado also demolished a storage building. This was ranked as an F1 Tornado, with winds estimated between 75 and 100 mph, by National Weather Service Personnel. The tornado also took out many trees around this area. The tornado lifted back up, but then reformed from the cell as the storm moved into the cities of Torrington and Winstead. This second tornado was ranked on the Fujita scale as an F2 with winds estimated between 100 and 130 mph. It touched down near the Torrington Middle School, over the Midget Football Field cutting a swath two hundred yards wide and a half a mile in length. The tornado destroyed an 8,000 dollar shed that had recently been completed by the Midget Football League. The second twister also demolished the  bleachers and part of a roof at the Torrington Middle school. In addition, hundreds of large trees were uprooted. Powerlines were also destroyed.

The tornado first touched down just inside the George county line near Red Edwards Lane and Howell Road and moved north from there.   Initially the tornado just produced tree damage, with some minor roof damage to a couple of homes.  As the tornado moved north, it crossed Griffin Lane and totally destroyed a newer model manufactured home.  The mobile home tie downs were pulled out of the ground and the home turned over and was torn apart as it rolled.  The female occupant of the home was in the house at the time the tornado struck, and was injured, suffering a broken collarbone.   The tornado then crossed Appaloosa Road and caused major damage to a two story home.  The family that lived at the home was upstairs when the tornado struck.  They saw the tornado approaching and took shelter downstairs.  They were not injured, but part of the roof of the house was ripped off, and the upstairs room that they were previously in was heavily damaged.  The occupants said the tornado made very little noise as it approached.   The tornado continued moving through a wooded area, crossing State Highway 612 just west of Walt Tanner Road.  Here trees were blown down and a home received roof damage.  The tornado continued moving north and destroyed  four manufactured homes and blew down several trees near Sandy Hill Drive.  The tornado then moved across a forested area and then did considerable damage along Lucas Road.  Several homes were damaged and numerous trees were blown down in this area.

The tornado first touched down just inside the George county line near Red Edwards Lane and Howell Road and moved north from there.   Initially the tornado just produced tree damage, with some minor roof damage to a couple of homes.  As the tornado moved north, it crossed Griffin Lane and totally destroyed a newer model manufactured home.  The mobile home tie downs were pulled out of the ground and the home turned over and was torn apart as it rolled.  The female occupant of the home was in the house at the time the tornado struck, and was injured, suffering a broken collarbone.   The tornado then crossed Appaloosa Road and caused major damage to a two story home.  The family that lived at the home was upstairs when the tornado struck.  They saw the tornado approaching and took shelter downstairs.  They were not injured, but part of the roof of the house was ripped off, and the upstairs room that they were previously in was heavily damaged.  The occupants said the tornado made very little noise as it approached.   The tornado continued moving through a wooded area, crossing State Highway 612 just west of Walt Tanner Road.  Here trees were blown down and a home received roof damage.  The tornado continued moving north and destroyed  four manufactured homes and blew down several trees near Sandy Hill Drive.  The tornado then moved across a forested area and then did considerable damage along Lucas Road.  Several homes were damaged and numerous trees were blown down in this area.  The tornado then crossed U. S. Highway 98 and went back into the clouds near Moody Road.  Damage to this area was mostly to trees.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The thunderstorms which spawned them were created when a strong cold front moved through the region.  One tornado touched down briefly in Orange County, just a few miles west of Gordonsville.  A resident saw the tornado come "off the mountain" and twist trees along Route 645 near the intersection of Route 33.  One tree landed on a vehicle near Route 33.  It is unknown exactly how long the twister was on the ground due to the rural nature of its path, so the path length of two tenths of a mile was estimated.  The damage path was about 25 yards wide and due to the amount of tree damage it was ranked an F1.  Shortly before the tornado touched down in Orange County, another storm produced a much stronger tornado over the northern half of Culpeper County.  The tornado was on the ground for 10 miles and touched down just east of Rixeyville on Route 640.  It was F0 strength at this location and downed a tree onto a home before moving northeast to Indian Fork Road.  On a hilltop at this location it destroyed all but the walkout basement of a two story brick house.  Debris from the home such as bricks and wood were impaled into the ground.  Plumbing and appliances were strewn across the yard and personal items such as clothing and bedding were found in trees at least 1/2 mile away.  A section of a deck was found intact 1/2 mile away and some insulation was discovered 6 miles from the site.  A car in the garage of the home was crushed by debris.  Fortunately, no one was home at the time the tornado hit.  A neighbor who witnessed the destruction said the home exploded like a bomb went off inside when the tornado "dropped onto it".  The tornado was ranked an F4 at this location with winds estimated around 210 MPH.  It weakened slightly as it moved northeast downing trees along a rural path south of Jeffersonton.  Next, it crossed through the heart of Jeffersonton along roughly Scottsville and Springs Roads at F2 strength.  Three trailer homes in the Ponderosa Trailer Court were destroyed, including one that was picked up and dropped in pieces 300 yards away.  Two people at the trailer park were injured, including one person who was hit in the back by flying debris while clinging to a pole outside.  Four churches, 4 trailer homes, 4 houses, and numerous trees and power lines were damaged in Jeffersonton.  Two barns and a garage attached to a home were destroyed.  The tornado continued to damage trees along its wooded path north of town before it crossed into Fauquier County.  The twister, now at F1 strength, remained on the ground for three more miles where it downed more trees and removed the roof of a barn.  The damage path crossed Hart Road and Holtzclaw Road, then it disappeared just north of Route 211.  The same storm dropped a second tornado in the northern portion of Fauquier County.  This tornado touched down southwest of The Plains just south of Interstate 66. Motorists saw it cross the interstate and push northeast toward Route 55.  At the intersection of Route 55 and Bunker Hill Road, the twister struck a home at F1 strength.  It ripped off the front porch, sending debris onto cars in the driveway.  It also destroyed a pool shed and damaged several trees.  The tornado crossed Route 55 where it downed trees and power poles and pushed over a tractor trailer.  The tornado weakened to F0 strength as it tracked north near Whitewood Road.  Two homes on Milestone Road and a few smaller buildings sustained minor damage.  A few trees were damaged as the tornado continued northward just west of Halfway.  The funnel dissipated before the storm crossed into Loudoun County.  Another thunderstorm dropped two tornadoes along the Interstate 95 and 395 corridor southwest of Washington D.C.  The first tornado touched down on Quantico Marine Corps Base just north of Garrisonville.  A funnel cloud was spotted near Garrisonville shortly before the twister touched down.  Trees were downed on the base along the path of the F0 tornado.  Personnel sited it as it passed a quarter mile west of the fire station.  The tornado continued north into Prince William County where it downed some trees in Prince William Forest Park area.  The tornado moved north into the Lake Montclair community where it took down a few trees, broke branches, and bent siding up on homes.  The weak tornado lifted shortly after.  Because the storm passed through several limited access areas, part of the tornado track was not able to be surveyed.  It is possible the tornado may not have been on the ground the entire time.The second tornado which remained on the ground for 15 miles passed through densely populated areas of Eastern Fairfax County, the western portion of the city of Alexandria, and Arlington County.  The F1 tornado touched down just west of Fort Belvoir near Newington Road in Fairfax County.  It skipped north-northeast through Kingstown and Franconia following Beulah Street (Route 613).  Minor damage was reported at the intersections of Windsor Avenue, Fleet Drive, and Walker Lane.  Several townhomes on Beulah Street received minor damage to roofing and siding.  Debris was also reported in the Franconia Commons development.  The tornado could be seen from the Franconia-Springfield metro station.  The next report of minor damage came from the Wellington Commons and Brookland Estates communities near the intersection of Franconia Road and Route 613.  Citywide, 10 homes received minor roof damage, two businesses sustained minor damage, and 40 trees and wires were downed.  Next, the twister crossed Eisenhower Road as it moved into the western portion of the City of Alexandria.  It weakened to F0 strength and was believed to have passed just west of Alexandria Hospital and into the Fort Ward Park area.  It downed a large sign on Interstate 395 at King Road.  Minor damage was reported in the Park Fairfax and Parc East communities along Martha Custis Drive near the Arlington County border.  The tornado returned to F1 strength and continued north-northeast paralleling Interstate 395 into the Shirlington portion of Arlington County.  It passed through the Arna Valley and Club Manor Estates developments near National Hospital Medical Center.  A woman walking down 28th Street in this area was injured when a tree branch fell onto her.  Nearby, windows were shattered at a restaurant.  The next concentrated area of damage occurred in the Virginia Highlands development between Kent and Ives Streets.  Several trees and wires were downed and a few house roofs sustained damage.  A weather observer at Reagan National Airport spotted the thin funnel as it moved from Crystal City over Pentagon City and across the 14th Street Bridge and reported a second funnel descending shortly before the tornado crossed the Potomac River.  The tornado moved across Interstate 395 just south of the Pentagon where it downed trees and road signs.  One woman was injured when a tree fell onto her vehicle.  Other vehicles received broken windows from flying debris.  The tornado started to weaken fast as it crossed the 14th Street Bridge into Washington D.C.  In addition to tornadoes, the storm produced very heavy downpours.  In Loudoun County, Town Branch in Leesburg overflowed its banks.  Several roads in low lying areas in and around town were also flooded including the Greenway at mile marker 8, Evergreen Mills Road, Loudoun Street, and the intersection of the Route 15 bypass at Sycolin Road.  Three water rescues were reported.  Street flooding was observed in Purcellville.  Rainfall reports included 4.1 to 4.8 inches in Leesburg, 3.95 inches in Lincoln and Purcellville, 3.9 inches in Ashburn, 2.60 inches in Middleburg, and 2.49 inches in Lovettsville.  In Fauquier County, Route 17 between Warrenton and Marshall was flooded.  Route 55 near Marshall was also covered with water.  Some secondary dirt roads in the northern portion of the county were partially washed out when small streams overflowed.  A total of 4.05 inches was recorded in The Plains and 2.14 inches fell in Warrenton.  In Culpeper County, 3.35 inches of rain fell in Culpeper.  In Madison County, rainfall totals included 2.80 inches in Hood, 2.77 inches at Fork Mountain, 2.65 inches in Wolftown, and 2.35 inches at Big Meadows. In Rappahannock County, 3.75 inches was reported in Castleton.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado damaged several buildings and destroyed one home before crossing into Fauquier County.

The thunderstorms which spawned them were created when a strong cold front moved through the region.  One tornado touched down briefly in Orange County, just a few miles west of Gordonsville.  A resident saw the tornado come "off the mountain" and twist trees along Route 645 near the intersection of Route 33.  One tree landed on a vehicle near Route 33.  It is unknown exactly how long the twister was on the ground due to the rural nature of its path, so the path length of two tenths of a mile was estimated.  The damage path was about 25 yards wide and due to the amount of tree damage it was ranked an F1.  Shortly before the tornado touched down in Orange County, another storm produced a much stronger tornado over the northern half of Culpeper County.  The tornado was on the ground for 10 miles and touched down just east of Rixeyville on Route 640.  It was F0 strength at this location and downed a tree onto a home before moving northeast to Indian Fork Road.  On a hilltop at this location it destroyed all but the walkout basement of a two story brick house.  Debris from the home such as bricks and wood were impaled into the ground.  Plumbing and appliances were strewn across the yard and personal items such as clothing and bedding were found in trees at least 1/2 mile away.  A section of a deck was found intact 1/2 mile away and some insulation was discovered 6 miles from the site.  A car in the garage of the home was crushed by debris.  Fortunately, no one was home at the time the tornado hit.  A neighbor who witnessed the destruction said the home exploded like a bomb went off inside when the tornado "dropped onto it".  The tornado was ranked an F4 at this location with winds estimated around 210 MPH.  It weakened slightly as it moved northeast downing trees along a rural path south of Jeffersonton.  Next, it crossed through the heart of Jeffersonton along roughly Scottsville and Springs Roads at F2 strength.  Three trailer homes in the Ponderosa Trailer Court were destroyed, including one that was picked up and dropped in pieces 300 yards away.  Two people at the trailer park were injured, including one person who was hit in the back by flying debris while clinging to a pole outside.  Four churches, 4 trailer homes, 4 houses, and numerous trees and power lines were damaged in Jeffersonton.  Two barns and a garage attached to a home were destroyed.  The tornado continued to damage trees along its wooded path north of town before it crossed into Fauquier County.  The twister, now at F1 strength, remained on the ground for three more miles where it downed more trees and removed the roof of a barn.  The damage path crossed Hart Road and Holtzclaw Road, then it disappeared just north of Route 211.  The same storm dropped a second tornado in the northern portion of Fauquier County.  This tornado touched down southwest of The Plains just south of Interstate 66. Motorists saw it cross the interstate and push northeast toward Route 55.  At the intersection of Route 55 and Bunker Hill Road, the twister struck a home at F1 strength.  It ripped off the front porch, sending debris onto cars in the driveway.  It also destroyed a pool shed and damaged several trees.  The tornado crossed Route 55 where it downed trees and power poles and pushed over a tractor trailer.  The tornado weakened to F0 strength as it tracked north near Whitewood Road.  Two homes on Milestone Road and a few smaller buildings sustained minor damage.  A few trees were damaged as the tornado continued northward just west of Halfway.  The funnel dissipated before the storm crossed into Loudoun County.  Another thunderstorm dropped two tornadoes along the Interstate 95 and 395 corridor southwest of Washington D.C.  The first tornado touched down on Quantico Marine Corps Base just north of Garrisonville.  A funnel cloud was spotted near Garrisonville shortly before the twister touched down.  Trees were downed on the base along the path of the F0 tornado.  Personnel sited it as it passed a quarter mile west of the fire station.  The tornado continued north into Prince William County where it downed some trees in Prince William Forest Park area.  The tornado moved north into the Lake Montclair community where it took down a few trees, broke branches, and bent siding up on homes.  The weak tornado lifted shortly after.  Because the storm passed through several limited access areas, part of the tornado track was not able to be surveyed.  It is possible the tornado may not have been on the ground the entire time.The second tornado which remained on the ground for 15 miles passed through densely populated areas of Eastern Fairfax County, the western portion of the city of Alexandria, and Arlington County.  The F1 tornado touched down just west of Fort Belvoir near Newington Road in Fairfax County.  It skipped north-northeast through Kingstown and Franconia following Beulah Street (Route 613).  Minor damage was reported at the intersections of Windsor Avenue, Fleet Drive, and Walker Lane.  Several townhomes on Beulah Street received minor damage to roofing and siding.  Debris was also reported in the Franconia Commons development.  The tornado could be seen from the Franconia-Springfield metro station.  The next report of minor damage came from the Wellington Commons and Brookland Estates communities near the intersection of Franconia Road and Route 613.  Citywide, 10 homes received minor roof damage, two businesses sustained minor damage, and 40 trees and wires were downed.  Next, the twister crossed Eisenhower Road as it moved into the western portion of the City of Alexandria.  It weakened to F0 strength and was believed to have passed just west of Alexandria Hospital and into the Fort Ward Park area.  It downed a large sign on Interstate 395 at King Road.  Minor damage was reported in the Park Fairfax and Parc East communities along Martha Custis Drive near the Arlington County border.  The tornado returned to F1 strength and continued north-northeast paralleling Interstate 395 into the Shirlington portion of Arlington County.  It passed through the Arna Valley and Club Manor Estates developments near National Hospital Medical Center.  A woman walking down 28th Street in this area was injured when a tree branch fell onto her.  Nearby, windows were shattered at a restaurant.  The next concentrated area of damage occurred in the Virginia Highlands development between Kent and Ives Streets.  Several trees and wires were downed and a few house roofs sustained damage.  A weather observer at Reagan National Airport spotted the thin funnel as it moved from Crystal City over Pentagon City and across the 14th Street Bridge and reported a second funnel descending shortly before the tornado crossed the Potomac River.  The tornado moved across Interstate 395 just south of the Pentagon where it downed trees and road signs.  One woman was injured when a tree fell onto her vehicle.  Other vehicles received broken windows from flying debris.  The tornado started to weaken fast as it crossed the 14th Street Bridge into Washington D.C.

The path of the tornado averaged 1/8 to 1/4 mile, but reached its greatest width of ½ mile as it approached Siren around 820 pm, where it did F-3 damage. Two people were killed by the tornado, and there were 16 injuries. Four hundred homes were destroyed, 200 in Siren alone, with 280 homes damaged, and 60 businesses destroyed or damaged. Most of the damage occurred in an 8-block area of Siren. Approximately 14,000 acres of trees were leveled along the tornado path.

The tornado strengthened as it moved east northeast into the Lipsey Subdivision.  Several homes sustained roof damage and numerous trees were blown down or snapped off.  One large home on Garland Street was rendered uninhabitable, as most of the roof was blown off and two exterior walls were destroyed.  The occupant escaped with minor injuries.  The tornado crossed Highway 51, blowing down numerous trees, power lines, and utility poles. A large portion of the roof of the Church of Christ building was removed and blown into a tree about one mile away.  The Wise County Regional Hospital had some windows broken.  As the tornado crossed Highway 287, it weakened doing sporadic F0 damage to trees in a residential area just south of downtown.  The tornado reintensified just east of downtown near the intersection if Business Highway 81 and Old Denton Road, where a 10,000 square foot storage building was destroyed.  The tornado continued moving northeast, severely damaging three homes. Two four inch diameter posts from a gazebo were thrown 1/4 of a mile and driven one foot into the ground. The tornado crossed Highway 380, heavily damaging a ranch, then moved into a heavily wooded area blowing down hundreds of trees before dissipating.

The tornado strengthened as it moved east northeast into the Lipsey Subdivision.  Several homes sustained roof damage and numerous trees were blown down or snapped off.  One large home on Garland Street was rendered uninhabitable, as most of the roof was blown off and two exterior walls were destroyed.  The occupant escaped with minor injuries.  The tornado crossed Highway 51, blowing down numerous trees, power lines, and utility poles. A large portion of the roof of the Church of Christ building was removed and blown into a tree about one mile away.  The Wise County Regional Hospital had some windows broken.  As the tornado crossed Highway 287, it weakened doing sporadic F0 damage to trees in a residential area just south of downtown.  The tornado reintensified just east of downtown near the intersection if Business Highway 81 and Old Denton Road, where a 10,000 square foot storage building was destroyed.  The tornado continued moving northeast, severely damaging three homes. Two four inch diameter posts from a gazebo were thrown 1/4 of a mile and driven one foot into the ground. The tornado crossed Highway 380, heavily damaging a ranch, then moved into a heavily wooded area blowing down hundreds of trees before dissipating.  Damage occurred to 50 homes,at least 8 businesses, and 2 churches.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 750K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One thunderstorm produced a devastating F3 tornado which was on the ground for 17.5 miles from College Park in Prince George's County to just east of Columbia in Howard County.  Multiple vortices were reported with the tornado at times.  The tornado first touched down in Northwest Branch Stream Valley Park just west of Hyattsville.  It rapidly strengthened to an F3 tornado with winds up to 200 MPH.  The damage path ranged in width from 100 to 200 yards.  The tornado crossed the intersection of Adelphi Road and University Boulevard into the western campus of the University of Maryland.  Ten trailers being used as a temporary office for the Maryland Fire and Rescue Institute were completely destroyed by the twister.  Debris from the trailers such as video tapes and pieces of paper were found up to 60 miles away in Northern Baltimore and Harford Counties in addition to extreme southeast Pennsylvania.  Four of the six people inside the trailers were injured, one seriously.  One staff member was thrown free of the destruction and was found in a dumpster nearby.  Another person dug their hands into the carpet and held on as their feet were being pulled up in the air by the tornado.  The other four occupants, including one child, took shelter under desks and survived.  Two University of Maryland students who were visiting their father who worked in the trailers left by car shortly before the tornado hit.  The two sisters, ages 20 and 23, were killed when the tornado picked up their car outside of Denton Hall and threw it either around or over an eight-story dorm.  They died instantly when their car crashed into a wooded area 300 yards from the road.  Most of the other buildings on the campus in the path of the storm were made of brick and suffered only minor to moderate damage, such as Denton Hall Dormitory, Easton Hall Dormitory and Dining Hall, and the President's Mansion.  A parking lot outside of Denton Hall full of cars was also hit by the tornado.  At least 200 vehicles in the parking lot were damaged, including at least 100 that were blown into and onto other vehicles.  At least twenty cars were totaled and one car was partially ripped apart.  The woods behind the parking lot were nearly flattened.  The bubble roof of the football practice facility near Byrd Stadium was removed.  Forty-eight people on campus, including 25 students, were injured by flying debris as the twister downed trees and ripped pieces of siding and roofing off buildings.  In addition, residential areas near the campus, including the University Courtyard Apartments sustained damage.  A total of 3000 students were left temporarily homeless after two dorms and an off-campus housing unit were evacuated due to storm damage.  During the recovery effort, a 78-year-old firefighter who responded to the tragedy at the University died of a heart attack shortly after returning from the scene. The tornado moved north-northeast off the campus and crossed University Boulevard at the intersection of Metzerott Road.  The steeple of a church was removed and cars were flipped near the intersection.  Power lines and trees were also downed.  The twister continued through Paint Branch Stream Valley Park where it downed numerous trees.   The tornado weakened to F2 strength before it crossed Interstate 95/495 just west of the Route 1 interchange.  It was remarkable that even though the highway was filled with bumper to bumper rush hour traffic, the only damage reported was a flipped tractor trailer.  The next area hit by the tornado was the community of Cherry Hill.  Several trees and power lines were downed onto roads and houses just west of Baltimore Avenue, including the Chestnut Hills subdivision.  Several businesses along Route 1 sustained minor damage, and three additional buildings lost portions of their roofs.  Three employees of a business in the Chestnut Hills Shopping Center were injured by flying glass after the windows on the front of the store were shattered.  The tornado moved across the National Agricultural Research Center and caused over $40 million dollars in damage.  Thirty greenhouses were damaged and several long term studies inside were destroyed.  Fifteen other buildings west of Route 1 suffered minor to moderate damage.  Numerous trees, including a row of historic willow oaks, were downed.  Over 65 vehicles in the employee parking lot were damaged by flying debris.  Eleven of these vehicles were totaled.  Just north of the research center, "stunning" tree and power line damage was reported at the intersection of Sellman and Montgomery Roads.  The tornado tracked across Powder Mill Road and ripped the roof off an office building at the intersection of Cedar Lane.  It continued across the Beltsville Heights development and caused damage to the roof at Martin Luther King Elementary School.  The tornado continued moving north-northeast toward Laurel.  The continuation of the damage path was located at the Virginia Manor Industrial Park on Van Dusen Road where several trees were downed.  The tornado was spotted as it moved past Laurel Hospital and it caused minor damage in the Village at Wellington subdivision nearby.  The next concentrated area of damage was found at Laurel High School.  An annex with 6 classrooms was heavily damaged.  The roof was ripped off three of the classrooms and three people inside the structure were injured by flying debris.  Significant damage was also reported to the athletic fields behind the school. The tornado moved northeast across the Fairlawn development where it damaged several homes.  One home on 10th Street was destroyed after the twister removed the roof and an outside wall.  On Montrose Avenue, a woman and her dog were briefly picked up by the tornado.  The woman sustained injuries to her hip and leg after being tossed 3 feet in the air and the dog landed uninjured.  The historic Harrison Building at the corner of 9th and Montgomery Streets lost its roof and a church and school nearby were damaged.  The tornado remained on the ground as it crossed the Patuxent River into Howard County.  Across Prince George's County, the tornado was responsible for $100 million in damage.  A total of 861 homes, 561 vehicles, and 23 businesses were damaged countywide.  In North Laurel, the twister heavily damaged a townhouse complex on Riverbrink Court in the Settlers Landing development.  A total of 43 townhomes were damaged, four of which were uninhabitable.  The tornado weakened to an F1 before it downed trees onto All Saints Road.  The tornado weakened to an F0 as it exited North Laurel and moved across Savage Park.  Isolated reports of downed trees were received in the community, including on Red Jacket Way, Vollmerhausen Road, and at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Route 32.  In its final stages, the tornado crossed the General Electric Appliance Park and downed its final tree at the intersection of Snowden River Parkway and Route 175 southeast of Columbia.In addition to the devastating tornado, the storms also produced very heavy rainfall and gusty winds.  In Anne Arundel County, strong winds from the tornadic thunderstorm downed 13 trees between Laurel and Maryland City.  In northern Carroll County, a bow echo produced damaging winds which downed trees along Bankard Road northwest of Union Mills.  Rainfall totals included 3.93 inches in Millers, 3.30 inches in Manchester, and 3.26 inches in Westminster.  In Montgomery County, 2 to 4 inches of rainfall across the western portion of the county caused low lying areas to quickly fill with water.  Several roads were flooded including River Road and Falls Road.  A motorist had to be rescued after their car stalled in high water in Poolsville.  A total of 3.61 inches of rainfall was recorded in Damascus.  In Howard County, between 2 and 3.75 inches of rain fell. A total of 2.86 inches was recorded in Columbia and 3.46 inches fell just southeast of the city.  In Frederick County, several roads were flooded by heavy downpours including Ball Road off Route 355 and New Design Road south of Adamstown Road.  Heavy rain downed trees at the intersection of Greenfield and Page Roads, Lingamore road and Gashouse Pike, Lawson Road and Route 75, and Bittle Road and Route 17.  Street flooding was also reported in Point of Rocks on Route 28. Rainfall totals included 2.54 inches in Wolfsville and 2.30 inches in Frederick.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A large multi-vortex tornado touched down near Hyattsville, tracked along the Route 1 cooridor from College Park to Laurel, then crossed into Howard County.

One thunderstorm produced a devastating F3 tornado which was on the ground for 17.5 miles from College Park in Prince George's County to just east of Columbia in Howard County.  Multiple vortices were reported with the tornado at times.  The tornado first touched down in Northwest Branch Stream Valley Park just west of Hyattsville.  It rapidly strengthened to an F3 tornado with winds up to 200 MPH.  The damage path ranged in width from 100 to 200 yards.  The tornado crossed the intersection of Adelphi Road and University Boulevard into the western campus of the University of Maryland.  Ten trailers being used as a temporary office for the Maryland Fire and Rescue Institute were completely destroyed by the twister.  Debris from the trailers such as video tapes and pieces of paper were found up to 60 miles away in Northern Baltimore and Harford Counties in addition to extreme southeast Pennsylvania.  Four of the six people inside the trailers were injured, one seriously.  One staff member was thrown free of the destruction and was found in a dumpster nearby.  Another person dug their hands into the carpet and held on as their feet were being pulled up in the air by the tornado.  The other four occupants, including one child, took shelter under desks and survived.  Two University of Maryland students who were visiting their father who worked in the trailers left by car shortly before the tornado hit.  The two sisters, ages 20 and 23, were killed when the tornado picked up their car outside of Denton Hall and threw it either around or over an eight-story dorm.  They died instantly when their car crashed into a wooded area 300 yards from the road.  Most of the other buildings on the campus in the path of the storm were made of brick and suffered only minor to moderate damage, such as Denton Hall Dormitory, Easton Hall Dormitory and Dining Hall, and the President's Mansion.  A parking lot outside of Denton Hall full of cars was also hit by the tornado.  At least 200 vehicles in the parking lot were damaged, including at least 100 that were blown into and onto other vehicles.  At least twenty cars were totaled and one car was partially ripped apart.  The woods behind the parking lot were nearly flattened.  The bubble roof of the football practice facility near Byrd Stadium was removed.  Forty-eight people on campus, including 25 students, were injured by flying debris as the twister downed trees and ripped pieces of siding and roofing off buildings.  In addition, residential areas near the campus, including the University Courtyard Apartments sustained damage.  A total of 3000 students were left temporarily homeless after two dorms and an off-campus housing unit were evacuated due to storm damage.  During the recovery effort, a 78-year-old firefighter who responded to the tragedy at the University died of a heart attack shortly after returning from the scene. The tornado moved north-northeast off the campus and crossed University Boulevard at the intersection of Metzerott Road.  The steeple of a church was removed and cars were flipped near the intersection.  Power lines and trees were also downed.  The twister continued through Paint Branch Stream Valley Park where it downed numerous trees.   The tornado weakened to F2 strength before it crossed Interstate 95/495 just west of the Route 1 interchange.  It was remarkable that even though the highway was filled with bumper to bumper rush hour traffic, the only damage reported was a flipped tractor trailer.  The next area hit by the tornado was the community of Cherry Hill.  Several trees and power lines were downed onto roads and houses just west of Baltimore Avenue, including the Chestnut Hills subdivision.  Several businesses along Route 1 sustained minor damage, and three additional buildings lost portions of their roofs.  Three employees of a business in the Chestnut Hills Shopping Center were injured by flying glass after the windows on the front of the store were shattered.  The tornado moved across the National Agricultural Research Center and caused over $40 million dollars in damage.  Thirty greenhouses were damaged and several long term studies inside were destroyed.  Fifteen other buildings west of Route 1 suffered minor to moderate damage.  Numerous trees, including a row of historic willow oaks, were downed.  Over 65 vehicles in the employee parking lot were damaged by flying debris.  Eleven of these vehicles were totaled.  Just north of the research center, "stunning" tree and power line damage was reported at the intersection of Sellman and Montgomery Roads.  The tornado tracked across Powder Mill Road and ripped the roof off an office building at the intersection of Cedar Lane.  It continued across the Beltsville Heights development and caused damage to the roof at Martin Luther King Elementary School.  The tornado continued moving north-northeast toward Laurel.  The continuation of the damage path was located at the Virginia Manor Industrial Park on Van Dusen Road where several trees were downed.  The tornado was spotted as it moved past Laurel Hospital and it caused minor damage in the Village at Wellington subdivision nearby.  The next concentrated area of damage was found at Laurel High School.  An annex with 6 classrooms was heavily damaged.  The roof was ripped off three of the classrooms and three people inside the structure were injured by flying debris.  Significant damage was also reported to the athletic fields behind the school. The tornado moved northeast across the Fairlawn development where it damaged several homes.  One home on 10th Street was destroyed after the twister removed the roof and an outside wall.  On Montrose Avenue, a woman and her dog were briefly picked up by the tornado.  The woman sustained injuries to her hip and leg after being tossed 3 feet in the air and the dog landed uninjured.  The historic Harrison Building at the corner of 9th and Montgomery Streets lost its roof and a church and school nearby were damaged.  The tornado remained on the ground as it crossed the Patuxent River into Howard County.  Across Prince George's County, the tornado was responsible for $100 million in damage.  A total of 861 homes, 561 vehicles, and 23 businesses were damaged countywide.  In North Laurel, the twister heavily damaged a townhouse complex on Riverbrink Court in the Settlers Landing development.  A total of 43 townhomes were damaged, four of which were uninhabitable.  The tornado weakened to an F1 before it downed trees onto All Saints Road.  The tornado weakened to an F0 as it exited North Laurel and moved across Savage Park.  Isolated reports of downed trees were received in the community, including on Red Jacket Way, Vollmerhausen Road, and at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Route 32.  In its final stages, the tornado crossed the General Electric Appliance Park and downed its final tree at the intersection of Snowden River Parkway and Route 175 southeast of Columbia.In addition to the devastating tornado, the storms also produced very heavy rainfall and gusty winds.  In Anne Arundel County, strong winds from the tornadic thunderstorm downed 13 trees between Laurel and Maryland City.  In northern Carroll County, a bow echo produced damaging winds which downed trees along Bankard Road northwest of Union Mills.  Rainfall totals included 3.93 inches in Millers, 3.30 inches in Manchester, and 3.26 inches in Westminster.  In Montgomery County, 2 to 4 inches of rainfall across the western portion of the county caused low lying areas to quickly fill with water.  Several roads were flooded including River Road and Falls Road.  A motorist had to be rescued after their car stalled in high water in Poolsville.  A total of 3.61 inches of rainfall was recorded in Damascus.  In Howard County, between 2 and 3.75 inches of rain fell. A total of 2.86 inches was recorded in Columbia and 3.46 inches fell just southeast of the city.  In Frederick County, several roads were flooded by heavy downpours including Ball Road off Route 355 and New Design Road south of Adamstown Road.  Heavy rain downed trees at the intersection of Greenfield and Page Roads, Lingamore road and Gashouse Pike, Lawson Road and Route 75, and Bittle Road and Route 17.  Street flooding was also reported in Point of Rocks on Route 28. Rainfall totals included 2.54 inches in Wolfsville and 2.30 inches in Frederick.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A large multi-vortex tornado touched down near Hyattsville, tracked along the Route 1 cooridor from College Park to Laurel, then crossed into Howard County.

The tornado tracked northeast and produced extensive F2-type damage to homes and trailer homes along Tidwell Road where several injuries occurred.

Large trees around the house were uprooted and snapped at mid-trunk. From there, the tornado continued moving northeast and produced it's worst, F4 magnitude damage, between Robbins Lake and Airport Road.  Large trees were completely snapped off at ground level;  two tandem-wheel dump trucks were overturned, and moved or rolled 30 yards;  several storage containers filled with construction supplies and equipment were rolled up to 50 yards;  a large bulldozer was moved 5 feet;  a large pole-barn building was completely obliterated.The tornado continued northeast across Robbins Field,  then across an unpopulated area, until it entered western Etowah County in the town of Altoona.  One church was also destroyed.  The tornado affected the south and east sections of Altoona.  The tornado descended a steep hill and downed an entire stand of pine trees at mid-trunk.  Several homes and trailer-homes were damaged or destroyed, including a well-constructed $250,000 home which was completely destroyed, the third occurrence of F4 magnitude damage.  The tornado crossed SR 132, ascending a steep hill,  and dissipated.  At it's widest point,  the tornado was approximately one-quarter mile wide.

Nineteen tornadoes were confirmed, with three rated F3. The first F3 tornado developed in northeast Beckham County, near Elk City, and tracked northeastward for 11 miles before dissipating. As the tornado entered Custer County, a home of wood frame with brick exterior had most of its interior and exterior walls destroyed. The tornado then continued across an unpopulated area, causing major damage to trees and fences, before dissipating 2.5 miles west of Foss Dam. The second F3 tornado developed in Washita County, near Cordell. The Oklahoma State Emergency Management Office estimated that 477 single-family homes were damaged, 132 considered uninhabitable. In addition, 40 businesses were damaged, 22 considered uninhabitable. Damage was estimated near 100 million dollars, and nine injuries were reported. The last F3 tornado developed in Kiowa County and produced F3 damage soon after entering Washita County. Several vehicles and large pieces of farm equipment were tossed and destroyed. About 4 miles north-northeast of Mountain View, 3 homes suffered major damage, with one rated F3. As the tornado continued northeastward, F3 damage was inflicted on a farm, where a house and several barns and outbuildings were leveled. A 10,000 gallon diesel tank ended up in an open field about one-quarter mile away from its original position.For simplicity, the tornadoes that occurred on this day were identified by the supercell thunderstorm that produced them, beginning with A and ending with E. Each tornado was then given its own number. For example, the 3rd tornado produced by supercell thunderstorm A is called A3. In addition, some tornadoes tracked across multiple counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> D2.  Washita County portion. Extensive tree damage was observed from the Kiowa/Washita County border, northeastward to near State Highway 115, where the tornado leveled (rated F2) the Oakdale Schoolhouse, an old structure built in the 1920s. Across the street from the schoolhouse, a diesel shop was leveled, along with a barn, garage, and an unanchored wood-floor home. Several vehicles and large pieces of farm equipment were also tossed and destroyed. About 4 miles north-northeast of Mountain View, 3 homes suffered major damage, with one rated F3.

Each tornado was then given its own number. For example, the 3rd tornado produced by supercell thunderstorm A is called A3. In addition, some tornadoes tracked across multiple counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> D2.  Washita County portion. Extensive tree damage was observed from the Kiowa/Washita County border, northeastward to near State Highway 115, where the tornado leveled (rated F2) the Oakdale Schoolhouse, an old structure built in the 1920s. Across the street from the schoolhouse, a diesel shop was leveled, along with a barn, garage, and an unanchored wood-floor home. Several vehicles and large pieces of farm equipment were also tossed and destroyed. About 4 miles north-northeast of Mountain View, 3 homes suffered major damage, with one rated F3. As the tornado continued northeastward, F3 damage was inflicted on a farm, where a house and several barns and outbuildings were leveled.

Initial damage was limited to chicken houses and grain bins which suffered sporadic damage. The tornado quickly intensified as it crossed the Highway and moved north across a residence. Extensive damage occurred to the property including two storage buildings swept clean of their foundations, a dump truck flipped almost 30 feet, and the loss of the residence's roof. Nearly a dozen other vehicles suffered collateral damage, along with numerous trees stripped or uprooted. Three individuals were injured as their vehicle was flipped over.

The storm produced a violent tornado that touced down 2.5 miles southwest of Winterville, or along the northern edge of Lake Ferguson. The tornado had a width of up to one half mile and moved through the town of Winterville, causing extensive damage. It then continued northeast into southern Bolivar county about 2 miles northeast of Winterville. The total path length in Washington County was 4.8 miles. The tornado entered southern Bolivar County about 3.5 miles southwest of Stringtown. It travelled northeast 25.5 miles through mostly rural areas of Bolivar County and lifted one mile southeast of Mound Bayou. In Washington County, the tornado caused 12 injuries, mainly in the community of Winterville. In Bolivar County, 36 people were injured, including one 7 year old boy who was critically injured. In Washinton County, a total of six houses, five mobile homes, and two businesses were totally destroyed. Additionally, extensive damage was done to 34 houses and six businesses. Minor damage occurred to over 30 houses and several mobile homes. Total damage to the county was estimated to be around $3.5 million. In Bolivar County, the tornado destroyed ten houses, two mobile homes, and four businesses.  Extensive damage occurred to 21 houses, one mobile home, and one business. Minor damage occurred to over 20 houses and around 20 mobile homes.  The tornado caused extensive damage to the Bolivar County Detention Center, and hit an electric power substation. The substation was totally destroyed it. At the substation, the tornado blew over a tranformer that weighed approximately 25 tons, and slid another transformer sideways three feet. Total damage in Bolivar County was estimated at around $6 million.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 6M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Nineteen tornadoes were confirmed, with three rated F3. The first F3 tornado developed in northeast Beckham County, near Elk City, and tracked northeastward for 11 miles before dissipating. As the tornado entered Custer County, a home of wood frame with brick exterior had most of its interior and exterior walls destroyed. The tornado then continued across an unpopulated area, causing major damage to trees and fences, before dissipating 2.5 miles west of Foss Dam. The second F3 tornado developed in Washita County, near Cordell. The Oklahoma State Emergency Management Office estimated that 477 single-family homes were damaged, 132 considered uninhabitable. In addition, 40 businesses were damaged, 22 considered uninhabitable. Damage was estimated near 100 million dollars, and nine injuries were reported. The last F3 tornado developed in Kiowa County and produced F3 damage soon after entering Washita County. Several vehicles and large pieces of farm equipment were tossed and destroyed. About 4 miles north-northeast of Mountain View, 3 homes suffered major damage, with one rated F3. As the tornado continued northeastward, F3 damage was inflicted on a farm, where a house and several barns and outbuildings were leveled. A 10,000 gallon diesel tank ended up in an open field about one-quarter mile away from its original position.For simplicity, the tornadoes that occurred on this day were identified by the supercell thunderstorm that produced them, beginning with A and ending with E. Each tornado was then given its own number. For example, the 3rd tornado produced by supercell thunderstorm A is called A3. In addition, some tornadoes tracked across multiple counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> C1.  This tornado developed on the southwest side of Cordell, where a mobile home and metal warehouse were blown into a farmhouse. The tornado then moved through south, east and northeast portions of Cordell, including a business district and a large residential area. Most damage south of Main Street was rated F0 or F1. North of Main Street, the damage path widened to approximately 500 yards, with the tornado then inflicting widespread F1 to F2 damage up to 12th Street. Hundreds of homes were damaged in this area. As the tornado began to exit the northeast side of Cordell, F3 damage was sustained to several homes on 9th Street, just west of Crider Road. An F4 rating was considered; however, the structural integrity of most structures was at or below average, and was taken into consideration. Another interesting note is that several eye-witnesses reported that the tornado was widest and contained the most violent-looking winds at this time. The tornado eventually exited Cordell and dissipated 3.5 miles northeast of town. The Oklahoma State Emergency Management Office estimated that 477 single-family homes were damaged, 132 considered uninhabitable. In addition, 40 businesses were damaged, 22 considered uninhabitable.

Fortunately, there were no serious injuries. The tornado touched down on Windsor Highway in Eaton county three quarters of a mile west of I-69. The tornado began as a F0 about 150 feet wide. The tornado moved northeast at about 40 m.p.h. and caused a considerable amount of tree damage, major damage to barns and outbuildings, and minor damage to homes. It crossed I-69 just south of Davis Highway, blowing over a semi trailer causing minor injuries. It began to strengthen and widen as it crossed Davis Highway, and numerous trees were blown down and barns destroyed. As it crossed I-96 it continued to strengthen and it destroyed a large metal building that housed a used parts store on Canal road. It lifted a double wide mobile home off its foundation, but did not cause major damage because the mobile home was securely tied down at all supports. Several trees were blown down in the area. The tornado continued northeast on Canal road and destroyed a large cooling tower at the Erickson power plant, at which time the tornado's peak intensity of F1 with 110 m.p.h. winds was attained. It was estimated that more than 4 million dollars in damage was incurred to the Lansing Board of Water and Light's Erickson power plant. The tornado continued to move northeast, gradually weakening and becoming wider. It caused damage to semi trailers and trees along Creyts road, and to the roof of the Meijer warehouse. It proceeded across Mt. Hope highway and crossed I-496 near Snow road. It knocked down a large tree and sent branches of the tree flying through the air like missiles, which broke windows out of numerous cars in a church parking lot. The tornado continued to weaken as it moved through residential areas just north of I-96, causing mainly tree damage. The last damage occurred on a golf course just east of Waverly road in Ingham county, where a tree was blown down. An isolated severe thunderstorm earlier in the day blew down several large limbs in Oakfield township (Kent county). In Harrison (Clare county), trained spotters reported that a large tree was blown down by a thunderstorm wind gusts. Finally, spotters in DeWitt (Clinton county) reported that a large tree was blown down onto a power line.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It crossed North River Road and continued over open country until it crossed Ranch Road 1623.  After passing RR1623 for approximately .25 miles, it dissipated.  The worst damage, F3 level, was to trees and homes between RR1623 and SH290, across the northwest and north central part of Stonewall.  Ninety homes sustained damage with 6 destroyed.  In addition, 7 mobile homes were destroyed and 20 damaged.  Damage was also reported to 22 buildings.  A two-story home had the entire second story destroyed, and a concrete building lost most of its walls and all of its roof.  Other damage along the path typically included destroyed and damaged roofs and walls of homes and businesses as well as widespread damage to trees.  The tornado path was approximately .25 miles in width and 2.5 miles in length.  Although the tornado was not seen due to the late hour and darkness, residents did report that after heavy rain and hail, the wind became calm, and it was followed by a "roaring sound" so often reported in tornadoes.

The thunderstorms which spawned them were created when a strong cold front moved through the region.  One tornado touched down briefly in Orange County, just a few miles west of Gordonsville.  A resident saw the tornado come "off the mountain" and twist trees along Route 645 near the intersection of Route 33.  One tree landed on a vehicle near Route 33.  It is unknown exactly how long the twister was on the ground due to the rural nature of its path, so the path length of two tenths of a mile was estimated.  The damage path was about 25 yards wide and due to the amount of tree damage it was ranked an F1.  Shortly before the tornado touched down in Orange County, another storm produced a much stronger tornado over the northern half of Culpeper County.  The tornado was on the ground for 10 miles and touched down just east of Rixeyville on Route 640.  It was F0 strength at this location and downed a tree onto a home before moving northeast to Indian Fork Road.  On a hilltop at this location it destroyed all but the walkout basement of a two story brick house.  Debris from the home such as bricks and wood were impaled into the ground.  Plumbing and appliances were strewn across the yard and personal items such as clothing and bedding were found in trees at least 1/2 mile away.  A section of a deck was found intact 1/2 mile away and some insulation was discovered 6 miles from the site.  A car in the garage of the home was crushed by debris.  Fortunately, no one was home at the time the tornado hit.  A neighbor who witnessed the destruction said the home exploded like a bomb went off inside when the tornado "dropped onto it".  The tornado was ranked an F4 at this location with winds estimated around 210 MPH.  It weakened slightly as it moved northeast downing trees along a rural path south of Jeffersonton.  Next, it crossed through the heart of Jeffersonton along roughly Scottsville and Springs Roads at F2 strength.  Three trailer homes in the Ponderosa Trailer Court were destroyed, including one that was picked up and dropped in pieces 300 yards away.  Two people at the trailer park were injured, including one person who was hit in the back by flying debris while clinging to a pole outside.  Four churches, 4 trailer homes, 4 houses, and numerous trees and power lines were damaged in Jeffersonton.  Two barns and a garage attached to a home were destroyed.  The tornado continued to damage trees along its wooded path north of town before it crossed into Fauquier County.  The twister, now at F1 strength, remained on the ground for three more miles where it downed more trees and removed the roof of a barn.  The damage path crossed Hart Road and Holtzclaw Road, then it disappeared just north of Route 211.  The same storm dropped a second tornado in the northern portion of Fauquier County.  This tornado touched down southwest of The Plains just south of Interstate 66. Motorists saw it cross the interstate and push northeast toward Route 55.  At the intersection of Route 55 and Bunker Hill Road, the twister struck a home at F1 strength.  It ripped off the front porch, sending debris onto cars in the driveway.  It also destroyed a pool shed and damaged several trees.  The tornado crossed Route 55 where it downed trees and power poles and pushed over a tractor trailer.  The tornado weakened to F0 strength as it tracked north near Whitewood Road.  Two homes on Milestone Road and a few smaller buildings sustained minor damage.  A few trees were damaged as the tornado continued northward just west of Halfway.  The funnel dissipated before the storm crossed into Loudoun County.  Another thunderstorm dropped two tornadoes along the Interstate 95 and 395 corridor southwest of Washington D.C.  The first tornado touched down on Quantico Marine Corps Base just north of Garrisonville.  A funnel cloud was spotted near Garrisonville shortly before the twister touched down.  Trees were downed on the base along the path of the F0 tornado.  Personnel sited it as it passed a quarter mile west of the fire station.  The tornado continued north into Prince William County where it downed some trees in Prince William Forest Park area.  The tornado moved north into the Lake Montclair community where it took down a few trees, broke branches, and bent siding up on homes.  The weak tornado lifted shortly after.  Because the storm passed through several limited access areas, part of the tornado track was not able to be surveyed.  It is possible the tornado may not have been on the ground the entire time.The second tornado which remained on the ground for 15 miles passed through densely populated areas of Eastern Fairfax County, the western portion of the city of Alexandria, and Arlington County.  The F1 tornado touched down just west of Fort Belvoir near Newington Road in Fairfax County.  It skipped north-northeast through Kingstown and Franconia following Beulah Street (Route 613).  Minor damage was reported at the intersections of Windsor Avenue, Fleet Drive, and Walker Lane.  Several townhomes on Beulah Street received minor damage to roofing and siding.  Debris was also reported in the Franconia Commons development.  The tornado could be seen from the Franconia-Springfield metro station.  The next report of minor damage came from the Wellington Commons and Brookland Estates communities near the intersection of Franconia Road and Route 613.  Citywide, 10 homes received minor roof damage, two businesses sustained minor damage, and 40 trees and wires were downed.  Next, the twister crossed Eisenhower Road as it moved into the western portion of the City of Alexandria.  It weakened to F0 strength and was believed to have passed just west of Alexandria Hospital and into the Fort Ward Park area.  It downed a large sign on Interstate 395 at King Road.  Minor damage was reported in the Park Fairfax and Parc East communities along Martha Custis Drive near the Arlington County border.  The tornado returned to F1 strength and continued north-northeast paralleling Interstate 395 into the Shirlington portion of Arlington County.  It passed through the Arna Valley and Club Manor Estates developments near National Hospital Medical Center.  A woman walking down 28th Street in this area was injured when a tree branch fell onto her.  Nearby, windows were shattered at a restaurant.  The next concentrated area of damage occurred in the Virginia Highlands development between Kent and Ives Streets.  Several trees and wires were downed and a few house roofs sustained damage.  A weather observer at Reagan National Airport spotted the thin funnel as it moved from Crystal City over Pentagon City and across the 14th Street Bridge and reported a second funnel descending shortly before the tornado crossed the Potomac River.  The tornado moved across Interstate 395 just south of the Pentagon where it downed trees and road signs.  One woman was injured when a tree fell onto her vehicle.  Other vehicles received broken windows from flying debris.  The tornado started to weaken fast as it crossed the 14th Street Bridge into Washington D.C.  In addition to tornadoes, the storm produced very heavy downpours.  In Loudoun County, Town Branch in Leesburg overflowed its banks.  Several roads in low lying areas in and around town were also flooded including the Greenway at mile marker 8, Evergreen Mills Road, Loudoun Street, and the intersection of the Route 15 bypass at Sycolin Road.  Three water rescues were reported.  Street flooding was observed in Purcellville.  Rainfall reports included 4.1 to 4.8 inches in Leesburg, 3.95 inches in Lincoln and Purcellville, 3.9 inches in Ashburn, 2.60 inches in Middleburg, and 2.49 inches in Lovettsville.  In Fauquier County, Route 17 between Warrenton and Marshall was flooded.  Route 55 near Marshall was also covered with water.  Some secondary dirt roads in the northern portion of the county were partially washed out when small streams overflowed.  A total of 4.05 inches was recorded in The Plains and 2.14 inches fell in Warrenton.  In Culpeper County, 3.35 inches of rain fell in Culpeper.  In Madison County, rainfall totals included 2.80 inches in Hood, 2.77 inches at Fork Mountain, 2.65 inches in Wolftown, and 2.35 inches at Big Meadows. In Rappahannock County, 3.75 inches was reported in Castleton.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado from Alexandria moved just east of Interstate 395 from Shirlington to Pentagon City before it crossed the 14th Street bridge into D.C.

The hail covered the ground to several inches in some locations with most stones in the 1/2 to 1 1/2 inch range, although some were larger.   From central into downtown Omaha, as the hail fell the visibility was lowered to near zero and the hail drifted like snow and shovels were used to clear some sidewalks.  An elderly Omaha woman was injured with some cuts and bruises from the hail when she was caught outside.  According to State Farm Insurance agents, the storm was the costliest hailstorm in the Omaha area at least since the late 1980's and possibly ever.  State Farm estimated that there would be 100,000 claims in the Omaha Metro area.  Most of the larger hail spared the northwest sections of the Metro area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Vehicles sustained extensive body damage and the car windows were shattered.  A handful of people were treated for minor cuts and bruises.  Strong winds also flipped a tractor trailer along Interstate 70 near Watkins.  At least 30 private planes at Front Range Airport were totalled.  The radome protecting the National Weather Service doppler radar, which was tracking the storm, also sustained damage.  The storm caused power outages which affected about 1,200 residents.  Excluding the damage done at Denver International Airport, damage estimates totalled $49 million, making it the costliest storm in the last 3 years, and 10th costliest since 1984.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 49M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This storm exhibited very subtle bowing, but otherwise there was little to note about it's structure. Damage from this storm was limited to a residential mobile and modular home area perched on a broad hill. The homes were situated on 1 acre lots, so they were not densely packed.The damage primarily consisted of rolled and broken mobile homes. The damage area was limited to an area less than one mile in diameter. Five mobile homes were rolled and destroyed. Four mobile and modular homes sustained major roof damage. The mobile homes that were destroyed were scattered between homes which were completely undamaged. Examination of destroyed homes indicated that they were not tied down or had inadequate or no skirting at all. Homes that had plywood skirting and were tied down weathered the storm. Debris patterns provided evidence of diffluent winds, suggesting straight-line downburst winds. Five people recieved minor injuries from side being inside rolled mobile homes. Two injuries were the result of wind driven hail after escaping a destroyed mobile home.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
