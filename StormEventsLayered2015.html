Many of these storms produced large hail, downburst winds and heavy rainfall.  An initial supercell near Muleshoe later morphed into an intense cluster of storms that produced destructive downbursts in portions of Hale County.  The worst of these winds toppled two semi-trucks traveling on Interstate 27 causing minor injuries to one of the drivers.  Swaths of heavy rain also accompanied many of these storms resulting in flooded roads and fields.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A particularly intense series of downbursts with winds from 60 to 80 mph traveled east-southeast from about five miles west of Plainview to three miles west-southwest of Aiken.  These winds created swaths of damage consisting of siding and roofing blown from homes, downed power poles estimated at nearly 50 in total across northern Hale County, dozens of downed trees, and even two semi-trucks toppled on Interstate 27.  One driver suffered minor injuries and required treatment at a hospital.  A broadcast media's weather station four miles south of Plainview recorded a peak gust to 73 mph at 513 PM and a Texas Tech University West Texas mesonet one mile south of Plainview registered a peak gust to 65 mph at 525 PM.  Law enforcement estimated gusts as high as 80 mph at times when the semi-trucks were blown over.  The number of downed power poles along Interstate 27 forced the closure of all lanes for six hours until utility crews could complete the necessary repairs.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

They were mostly farm roads flooded near the river, outside the Evansville city limits. Most of the flooded roads were south of Interstate 164 in the southeast part of the county and in lowland areas in the southwest part of the county. One motorist drowned after disregarding barricades and driving down a flooded road. A passenger in the vehicle was able to roll down a window and escape from the pickup truck. A police officer arrived, threw a rope to the passenger, and pulled her to safety. The driver of the truck was located underwater by the dive team of the Evansville Fire Department. CPR was administered to the driver, who was rushed to a local hospital. The passenger was treated and released from the hospital. The driver died at the hospital. The estimated water level at the scene of the drowning was estimated to be at least 6 or 7 feet. Floodwaters backed up into Pigeon Creek, forcing that creek well out of its banks. The crest of 45.21 feet was about a foot-and-a-half below the crest of the April, 2011 flood.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The system began to spread rain into the region from the southwest during the early morning hours of Saturday, December 26th, with the rain continuing into Saturday night.  By the morning of Sunday, December 27th, widespread 2 to 5-inch totals were reported southeast of a Jacksonville to Rantoul line.  This amount of rain falling on saturated soils from recent wet conditions produced widespread flash flooding and fast rises on creeks and streams.  After a lull in the rainfall for much of Sunday, another round of rain moved in from the south from Sunday night through the afternoon of Monday, December 28th.  Heavy rains of 1 to 3 inches were common across the entire area from this portion of the event, further aggravating existing flooding conditions.  Once the flash flooding subsided, ongoing areal flooding persisted through December 31st...with river flooding continuing well into January 2016.  Many rivers climbed to major flood stage as a result of the excessive rainfall.  The flooding situation was made even worse by levee breaches, including one along the Embarras River near the Jasper-Crawford County line.  Four people died as a result of this major flooding event across central Illinois.  All four died when their vehicles were swept away by high water in Christian County early in the morning of December 29th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> An extended period of heavy rain during the evening of December 26th in Christian County combined with an already saturated ground to produce flash flooding. Rainfall amounts ranged from 2.50 to 4.50 inches in less than six hours, with the heaviest rain in the southern half of the county. Most rural roads and state highways were flooded and impassable. City streets in Taylorville and Pana were also flooded. The flooding continued through all of December 27th. Additional rainfall of 2.50 to 4.75 from December 28th into the 29th aggravated the flooding situation significantly. Every road in the county was flooded which resulted in a shortage of barricades to close the roads. The village of Kincaid was hardest hit as the South Fork of the Sangamon River overtopped levees and flooded the southeast part of town for the first time in its history. People had to be rescued by boat as all roads in and out of town were flooded. Three houses were destroyed by the flooding in Kincaid, with 41 others damaged. Four fatalities occurred in two separate incidents early in the morning of December 29th. Two 18 year old males died as their pickup truck was swept away in flood waters near the South Fork of the Sangamon River and Illinois Route 104 about one mile southeast of Kincaid. Two other people died as their van was swept into the Buckhart Creek about 5 miles ENE of Edinburg. The flooding finally subsided by the afternoon of December 31st, more than four days after it started.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.80M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Numerous roads across several counties we closed as very heavy, persistent rainfall prompted many rivers, streams, and low lying areas to flood.  One fatality was reported during this end of the year flood event.  ||A stalled frontal boundary draped SW to NE laid across the area from the 21st through the 23rd, with several rounds of showers and storms that occurred during this time. It was this rainfall event that likely pushed the HSA ���over the edge��� for the Christmas Day/Dec. 26th flooding that would come just a few days later. SPORT LIS data showed that soil moisture across much of the Central and South/Eastern portions of the HSA was in excess of 60-70%, and when this occurs with ���normal��� rainfall events, a good 2��� rainfall event will cause many tributaries that feed into the Tennessee River to flood. During this 3-day period, KMSL observed 1.03���, and KHSV measured 1.46��� on top of already saturated soils across much of the Tennessee Valley, translating much of this rainfall immediately to runoff. Another stalled front, oriented SW to NE, was draped across the area by the time Christmas Day arrived. A few disturbances moved northeastward along the front, bringing several rounds of showers and a few storms to the HSA yet again. In fact, rainfall started in many locations late Christmas Eve night, and continued into Christmas Day. The rainfall continued all day and into the day after Christmas, with many locations receiving the heavier rainfall on the 26th. Most locations (except NW AL) received at least 3���, with several locations measuring between 6 and 10 inches FOR THE DAY.||Significant river flooding occurred as well.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> From WHNT News Article: Madison County Coroner has identified a man who drowned Sunday afternoon in the New Hope area. Coroner Bobby Berryhill said Gary Sloman, 53, of New Hope, died around 2 p.m. Berryhill said Sloman had left his truck near the flooding to go check on a friend and got caught in the rushing water. Investigator Jeremy Hughes with the Madison County Sheriff���s Office said Sunday they received a call about a body found in flood waters. Deputies responded to CC Ivey Road around 4 p.m. Berryhill said the death was accidental, there were no signs of foul play.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The heaviest rainfall occurred in a 50 to 75 mile wide swath from southwest Missouri through the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area and into central Illinois.  Three day rainfall totals within this swath ranged from 6 to 12 inches, with lighter amounts extending both northwest and southeast to the state border.  Some of the precipitation fell as a wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow across northwest portions of the state.  All of this rain caused historic river flooding for the many rivers throughout the region. This resulted in floods of record on the Bourbeuse River at Union, the Meramec River at Pacific, Eureka, Valley Park, and Arnold, and major flooding on the Missouri River (at Gasconade and Hermann), the Mississippi River at Winfield Lock and Dam and points downstream, the Cuivre River at Old Monroe, Dardenne Creek, the Gasconade River, the Moreau River, the Illinois River, and the Kaskaskia River at Vandalia.  The only location not reporting flooding after this event was the Salt River near New London, where the Clarence Cannon Dam regulates the flow.  All other forecast points reported at least minor flooding. Seven flooding deaths were reported in our area due to the heavy rains. Approximately 1500 structures were either damaged or destroyed by the flood waters in the forecast area. At this time dollar amount damages are expected to top $1 billion dollars.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Between 5 and 8 inches of rain fell across Crawford County during a 2 day period. All of this rain caused the creeks and rivers to rise. The Meramec River rose above flood stage at Steelville on December 27th. On December 30th, an 81 year old man drove into the flood waters of the Meramec on Highway N at Campbell Bridge, about 5 miles southeast of Bourbon. He apparently got out of his vehicle and drown. The flooding caused major damage to one home and completely destroyed another one.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Rainfall amounts during the month of May across the Upper and Middle Red River basins of Southern Oklahoma and Northern Texas totaled over 20 inches of rain. At Shreveport, Louisiana, the Red River rose above the 30 foot flood stage on May 30th and rose above the 33 foot major flood stage on June 3rd. The Red River in Shreveport crested at 37.14 feet on June 9th which was the highest recorded crest in Shreveport, Louisiana since the flood of 1945. This was the 22nd highest crest at Shreveport in recorded history at the gauging location, with the flood of record being 45.90 feet in 1849. The Red River in Shreveport fell below the 33 foot major flood stage on June 15th and fell below the 30 foot flood stage on June 17th. A secondary rise on the Red River developed because of excessive heavy rainfall once again in the middle Red River Basin from the remnants of Tropical Storm Bill. As a result, the Red River at Shreveport crested again at 31.06 feet on June 30th. Downstream of Shreveport at Coushatta, Louisiana the Red River rose above the 31 foot flood stage on May 18th and rose above the 37 foot major flood stage on June 6th. The Red River in Coushatta crested at 38.83 feet on June 11th which was the highest recorded crest in Coushtatta, Louisiana since the flood of 1945. This was the 3rd highest crest at Coushatta in recorded history at the gauging location with the flood of record being 39.9 feet in 1945. The Red River in Coushatta fell below the 37 foot major flood stage on June 16th and fell below the 31 foot flood stage on June 23rd. A secondary rise on the Red River developed because of excessive heavy rainfall once again in the middle Red River Basin from the remnants of Tropical Storm Bill. As a result, the Red River at Coushatta crested again just above the 31 foot flood stage the first week of July, 2015. Below Coushatta at Grand Ecore, Louisiana, the Red River rose above the 33 foot flood stage on May 18th and rose above the 39 foot major flood stage on June 5th. The Red River in Grand Ecore crested at 42.03 feet on June 13th which was the highest recorded crest in Grand Ecore, Louisiana since the flood of 1945. This was the 2nd highest crest at Grand Ecore in recorded history at the gauging location with the flood of record being 44.7 feet in 1945. The Red River in Grand Ecore fell below the 39 foot major flood stage on June 19th and remained above the 33 foot flood stage through the first week of July because of a secondary rise on the Red River as the remnants of Tropical Storm Bill dumped additional heavy rainfall across the Middle Red River Basin in Northern Texas and Southern Oklahoma. Bank erosion was extreme along both west and east banks of the Red River in Grant Parish with thousands of acres of farmland and pastureland inundated. Cattle had to be relocated and many were lost. Many roads were closed adjacent to the Red River in Grant Parish.  The number of structures and homes affected by the rising river and a monetary amount of damage was not available for this writing. The Grant Parish Police Jury closed Lake Iatt and Nantachie Lake because of the flooding.  An annual event known as the Louisiana Mudfest was interrupted when the Red River breached a private levee on the grounds and flooded the park near Colfax, Louisiana.  A deputy working security for the event noticed a crack in the levee on the morning of June 14th.  Within minutes, the levee broke sending the swollen Red River into the park.  Deputies from the Sheriff's Office, agents with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, Louisiana State Police, The Louisiana Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness and The Louisiana National Guard all responded to evacuate 113 people.  This was done with the help of boats and helicopters.  There was one injury when an individual broke his arm.  A number of vehicles were flooded during the event.  About 255,000 sand bags were made available by local law enforcement and the Louisiana Governor's Office of Homeland Security with 655,000 more sandbags on standby. The Grant Parish homeland security sandbagged numerous homes that were in risk of flooding. The Governor of Louisiana authorized the activation of up to 200 Louisiana National Guardsman on State Active Duty to support flood response efforts in Northwest Louisiana and assist local, parish and state emergency officials.

Five tornadoes occurred over Jewell County. With no cap in place, scattered thunderstorms began developing as early as the noon hour over north central Kansas. Most storms rapidly became supercellular. These supercells began producing severe weather by 330 p.m. CDT. It was about this time that a short line formed from the Jewell-Smith County line south into Osborne County. Supercells were embedded within this line and several discrete supercells developed ahead of it over Mitchell and Jewell counties. Eventually, an MCS developed. The leading edge of the cold pool becoming stationary, with new storms repeatedly developing over north central Kansas and further downstream into southeastern Nebraska. Cell training produced a swath of 4-8 inches of rain over portions of Jewell County. The highest amount reported was 7.92 inches near Webber. ||A complex low pressure system extended from the Canadian Prairies into the western United States. These storms developed in the warm sector, far away from any discernible surface boundaries. However, an axis of confluence was present over north central Kansas. A deep upper-level trough was over the western U.S., with a ridge over the East. In the southwest flow between these features, a shortwave trough was lifting through the Central Plains. These storms formed in the southeast quadrant of the associated vorticity maximum. Around the time thunderstorms developed, temperatures were in the lower 70s with dewpoints in the lower 60s, resulting in low cloud bases. Even at mid-afternoon, cloud bases were only 2000-2500 ft. The surface conditions and mid-level lapse rates of 7 degrees C/km resulted in SBCAPE was around 1500 J/kg. Deep layer shear was only 25-30 knots. However, low-level wind fields were strong with 40-45 knots at 850 mb. This resulted in large hodographs with 0-1 km SRH values of 200-250 m2/s2, and 0-3 km SRH of 250-300 m2/s2. Combined with low cloud bases, this created a favorable environment for supercells and tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado started west of Mankato, traveling north and passing approximately 1 mile to the west of Burr Oak before turning more to the northeast and lifting. One woman was injured at her home approximately 4 miles south-southwest of Burr Oak.

Ten of the twelve were spawned from a single long-lived cyclic supercell, which tracked across Whiteside, Lee, LaSalle, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee Counties.  The heaviest damage was in Coal City (Grundy County) and Braidwood (Will County) which was caused by an EF-3 tornado with maximum winds of 160 mph, and the Woodhaven Campground in Sublette (Lee County) caused by an EF-2 tornado with maximum winds of 130 mph.  There were 14 injuries reported.  There were no fatalities.  The EF-3 Coal City to Braidwood tornado was the strongest tornado in Grundy County since an F3 tornado struck on July 17, 1972.  The atmosphere was primed for severe weather, with very warm, humid conditions, low pressure moving north of the region, and a strong jet stream aloft.  An outflow boundary from earlier storms during the late morning and early afternoon may have been key to where the long-lived tornado-producing storm tracked.  In addition to tornado and wind damage, slow moving storms brought torrential rainfall of locally up to 3 to 5 inches to portions of Lee, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee counties, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  This rain fell on top of soil already saturated from repeated heavy rains over the past few weeks.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down near Higgins Road and Dupont Road where softwood trees were snapped. The tornado moved east-southeast where trees and power poles were snapped along N Gorman Road.  The most significant damage was noted as the tornado crossed S Carbon Hill Road just south of Division Street, entering Coal City. Dozens of homes were heavily damaged in Coal City with three completely destroyed.  Two of these homes were well built and had at least part of their structure bolted down to the foundation with bolts secured by nuts.

Ten of the twelve were spawned from a single long-lived cyclic supercell, which tracked across Whiteside, Lee, LaSalle, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee Counties.  The heaviest damage was in Coal City (Grundy County) and Braidwood (Will County) which was caused by an EF-3 tornado with maximum winds of 160 mph, and the Woodhaven Campground in Sublette (Lee County) caused by an EF-2 tornado with maximum winds of 130 mph.  There were 14 injuries reported.  There were no fatalities.  The EF-3 Coal City to Braidwood tornado was the strongest tornado in Grundy County since an F3 tornado struck on July 17, 1972.  The atmosphere was primed for severe weather, with very warm, humid conditions, low pressure moving north of the region, and a strong jet stream aloft.  An outflow boundary from earlier storms during the late morning and early afternoon may have been key to where the long-lived tornado-producing storm tracked.  In addition to tornado and wind damage, slow moving storms brought torrential rainfall of locally up to 3 to 5 inches to portions of Lee, Grundy, Will, and Kankakee counties, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  This rain fell on top of soil already saturated from repeated heavy rains over the past few weeks.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado touched down near Higgins Road and Dupont Road where softwood trees were snapped. The tornado moved east-southeast where trees and power poles were snapped along N Gorman Road.  The most significant damage was noted as the tornado crossed S Carbon Hill Road just south of Division Street, entering Coal City. Dozens of homes were heavily damaged in Coal City with three completely destroyed.  Two of these homes were well built and had at least part of their structure bolted down to the foundation with bolts secured by nuts.  Two high tension metal trusses were downed including one that was crumpled along Hunters Run.  Hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted.  Numerous utility poles were downed.  Peak winds were estimated to be 160 mph with a max width of three quarters of a mile.  The tornado continued into Will County.

The mobile home and its associated storage building (also a mobile home) were thrown from its foundation. The primary home lost its metal frame and was thrown onto a storage shed to the southwest, about 60 feet to the southwest. The two mobile homes, which did not appear to have been strapped down, were overturned and one had the entire frame bent and twisted. While there were tree branches broken in the region, the most significant damage was on this property site, due to the rural nature of the area.  Power poles on the property were not damaged, although the lines were snapped.  ||One 79 year old gentleman was in the home with his dog also on the property.  The gentleman was in the mobile home and suffered injuries requiring transport to a local and then regional hospital.   The dog was found trapped under rubble but was ok. ||Based off of the damage that was observed, the winds were estimated at 100 mph.     The tornado continued through rural area to the south-southeast where it went into North Dakota about 5 miles south-southeast of the property site with the damage.  No reported damage has been noted in North Dakota and the tornado dissipated south-southwest of Trotters.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado touched down near Stone Road and moved eastnortheast, passing through the Blue Mountain Academy before crossing Mountain Road into a campground area before lifting.  The most significant damage occurred to the Blue Mountain Elementary School. The roof of the school was completely removed by the tornado. The building is a total loss.  The 52-year-old principal inside the school at the time of the tornado was injured and was found covered by ceiling tiles.  Pieces of the roof were found hundreds of yards away in trees.  Hardwood trees were snapped along the tornado's path with a soybean field having debris dragged through it with visible arcing marks.  ||The estimated path length of the EF-1 tornado was three-quarters of a mile with a maximum path width of 75 yards.

This trough ejected into the plains with a slight negative tilt which was indicative of strong jet dynamics in association with this trough. Likewise, low level and deep level shear was quite strong with this trough across Northeast Texas during the late afternoon and evening hours of the 12th as well as the morning hours of the 13th.  While instability was very weak, the strong shear made up for the development of strong to severe thunderstorms, some of which produced tornadoes across Northeast Texas.  Training of storm echoes also occurred which resulted in widespread flash flooding across the region as well.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A NWS Storm Survey team concluded that the damage in Franklin County, Texas west of Purley community was consistent with that of tornado damage.  The EF-2 tornado first touched down near County Road 3250 and traveled in a northerly direction, crossing County Road 2376 before lifting after crossing County Road 3055.  The worst of the damage was noted near the intersection of County Road 3170 and County Road 2376.  Numerous trees were snapped and/or uprooted along the path of this tornado.

Originally, the low pressure center developed in eastern/southeastern Colorado late Tuesday/early Wednesday and proceeded to quickly move east-northeast across Kansas before taking a more northeasterly turn as it approached southwest Iowa. Throughout the event, MUCAPE values were generally in the neighborhood of 500 J/kg.  Shear values were supportive with 0-1km values and 0-6km values around 35kts and 85-90kts respectively.  SRH values were also very supportive with 0-1km and 0-3km values around 350 m2/s2 and 500 m2/s2 respectively.  With the speed of the system and the ample support, resulting storms were fast moving, in excess of 40mph, and of the low topped supercell variety before transitioning into a linear system as the event progressed.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A high-end EF-1 tornado touched down southwest of Knoxville and traveled through the southeast side of town.

Originally, the low pressure center developed in eastern/southeastern Colorado late Tuesday/early Wednesday and proceeded to quickly move east-northeast across Kansas before taking a more northeasterly turn as it approached southwest Iowa. Throughout the event, MUCAPE values were generally in the neighborhood of 500 J/kg.  Shear values were supportive with 0-1km values and 0-6km values around 35kts and 85-90kts respectively.  SRH values were also very supportive with 0-1km and 0-3km values around 350 m2/s2 and 500 m2/s2 respectively.  With the speed of the system and the ample support, resulting storms were fast moving, in excess of 40mph, and of the low topped supercell variety before transitioning into a linear system as the event progressed.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A high-end EF-1 tornado touched down southwest of Knoxville and traveled through the southeast side of town.

A second squall line developed and trailed the first one by an hour or so.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Damage was first observed just north of the intersection of U.S. Route 27 and Bethel Loop. This location is south of Butler and northwest of Falmouth in Pendleton County. A mobile home originally anchored into the ground at 8-10 points was tilted and briefly lifted before rolling onto its top on the east side of Bethel Loop. The three residents sustained minor injuries requiring overnight hospitalization. Debris from the mobile home was carried downwind for approximately one-tenth of a mile. The debris field remained confined to a narrow path as it tapered to the east-northeast. This seemed indicative of convergent motion associated with the circulation. There were also several 6-8 inch trees snapped immediately west of the mobile home. This is likely where the first touchdown occurred. The tornado then lifted. The next damage location was a metal barn on Ashcraft Road. The entire roof was lifted and removed from the barn. The roof measured approximately 60 feet by 30 feet and the barn was relatively new (construction within the last 10 years). The roof was carried into adjacent trees immediately northeast of the structure. There was minor damage to a smaller barn just northwest of the path center line. The homeowner also described a dock approximately 15 square feet that was pulled from its anchor and moved north-northeast across a pond toward the center line of the path. All of this damage indicated a convergent and lifting motion associated with the tornado. The tornado then lifted again, as damage was next observed along Route 609 just south of the intersection with Davis Road. One barn west of Route 609 was destroyed and a tree approximately 20 inches in diameter immediately east of the road was snapped at the trunk and fell against a residence. Debris was carried between one and two tenths of a mile to the northeast. Another barn just to the north was partially destroyed. Tornadic damage was not as conclusive at this location, but debris was confined to a narrow path likely due to convergent wind motion. A number of trees were snapped to the northeast along Davis Road. Trees ranged in diameter from 8 to 16 inches. The clearest evidence of circulation on the ground was located along Route 159 where several types of damage occurred at a residence south of the intersection with Davis Road.

A second squall line developed and trailed the first one by an hour or so.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Damage was first observed just north of the intersection of U.S. Route 27 and Bethel Loop. This location is south of Butler and northwest of Falmouth in Pendleton County. A mobile home originally anchored into the ground at 8-10 points was tilted and briefly lifted before rolling onto its top on the east side of Bethel Loop. The three residents sustained minor injuries requiring overnight hospitalization. Debris from the mobile home was carried downwind for approximately one-tenth of a mile. The debris field remained confined to a narrow path as it tapered to the east-northeast. This seemed indicative of convergent motion associated with the circulation. There were also several 6-8 inch trees snapped immediately west of the mobile home. This is likely where the first touchdown occurred. The tornado then lifted. The next damage location was a metal barn on Ashcraft Road. The entire roof was lifted and removed from the barn. The roof measured approximately 60 feet by 30 feet and the barn was relatively new (construction within the last 10 years). The roof was carried into adjacent trees immediately northeast of the structure. There was minor damage to a smaller barn just northwest of the path center line. The homeowner also described a dock approximately 15 square feet that was pulled from its anchor and moved north-northeast across a pond toward the center line of the path. All of this damage indicated a convergent and lifting motion associated with the tornado. The tornado then lifted again, as damage was next observed along Route 609 just south of the intersection with Davis Road. One barn west of Route 609 was destroyed and a tree approximately 20 inches in diameter immediately east of the road was snapped at the trunk and fell against a residence. Debris was carried between one and two tenths of a mile to the northeast. Another barn just to the north was partially destroyed. Tornadic damage was not as conclusive at this location, but debris was confined to a narrow path likely due to convergent wind motion. A number of trees were snapped to the northeast along Davis Road. Trees ranged in diameter from 8 to 16 inches. The clearest evidence of circulation on the ground was located along Route 159 where several types of damage occurred at a residence south of the intersection with Davis Road. The roof was partially removed from the residence and some of the insulation was dispersed to the west and spattered against the west side of the house. Insulation was also spattered on trees immediately to the northwest. Heavy sections of metal fencing from a horse corral were lifted and carried approximately 50 yards to the west. Both of these debris fields were carried and deposited opposite the storm motion. A number of trees just north and south of the residence were also snapped.

Several tornadic supercell thunderstorms developed across northern Mississippi and western Tennessee, which then moved rapidly east-northeastward at up to 70 mph across Middle Tennessee during the evening hours on December 23. These storms produced 4 long-track tornadoes that caused 2 deaths and 7 reported injuries. Only 7 tornadoes had been previously recorded across Middle Tennessee in the month of December from the 1800s through 2014, easily making this the largest and worst December tornado outbreak in Middle Tennessee history.||In addition to the tornadoes, several reports of wind damage, large hail, and flash flooding were received. Some of the worst flash flooding occurred in Maury County, where 3 teenagers drowned in a submerged vehicle on Carters Creek Pike.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This strong, long-track EF3 tornado touched down just east of the Hardin County/Wayne County line about 2.5 miles southwest of the town of Lutts. At touchdown, hundreds of trees were snapped and uprooted before the tornado reached its peak strength about one half mile west-southwest of Lutts along Lutts Road where the tornado reached a width of 800 yards and EF3 strength. A post office and church, both brick buildings, were destroyed along with multiple homes swept from their foundations. Four people were injured here in Lutts. As the tornado continued northeast, hundreds of trees were snapped and uprooted along its path to where a concentrated area of trees were destroyed about 5 miles north of Collinwood. The tornado continued snapping and uprooting trees until the Highway 64 and Natchez Trace Parkway intersection. At this location, an outbuilding was destroyed along with the roof of a mobile home. Further northeast into Lawrence County along Napier Road, a house was swept off its foundation where 3 people were injured. As the tornado traveled northeast, several homes with roofs completely removed or damaged heavily were found along Linville Road. The tornado weakened as it crossed Lewis County into Maury County where a barn was destroyed and many trees were snapped and uprooted along Joy Road, 2 miles southwest of Mount Pleasant. The total path length of the tornado across Wayne, Lawrence, Lewis and Maury Counties was 48.51 miles.||This is the first tornado on record to occur in Wayne County, Lewis County, and Maury County in the month of December. Lawrence County previously had one tornado in the month of December, which occurred on December 7, 1951. In addition, this was the strongest tornado to occur in the NWS Nashville county warning area since April 10, 2009.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Multiple trees were snapped and uprooted along the nearby creek and along CR 54.||The next available damage was viewed along CR 1 south of CR 40. Many softwood and hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted along the hillside into the neighboring valley. The tornado damaged a single family home, removing large portions of the roofing marterial, and damaged the Williams Chapel Presbyterian Church where nearby residents were taking shelter. The tornado crossed CR 1, leaving almost no tree untouched in a large stand of pine trees.||The tornado continued over the hill to CR 40 where the most significant damage was observed. The tornado snapped numerous hardwood trees south of CR 40, caused minor damage to a single family residence, and pushed a mobile home off its foundation. Upon crossing CR 40, the tornado tore almost the entire roofing structure off a single family home, injuring one inhabitant, and tossing the debris into the trees behind it.

This generated an outbreak of severe weather and tornadoes through these regions. In northwest Alabama, a supercell produced an EF-2 tornado in Lauderdale County which tracked into southwest Tennessee.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado touched down initially near the intersection of Country Road 14 and County Road 54 north of Waterloo, in extreme western Lauderdale County. Multiple trees were snapped and uprooted along the nearby creek and along CR 54.||The next available damage was viewed along CR 1 south of CR 40. Many softwood and hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted along the hillside into the neighboring valley. The tornado damaged a single family home, removing large portions of the roofing marterial, and damaged the Williams Chapel Presbyterian Church where nearby residents were taking shelter. The tornado crossed CR 1, leaving almost no tree untouched in a large stand of pine trees.||The tornado continued over the hill to CR 40 where the most significant damage was observed. The tornado snapped numerous hardwood trees south of CR 40, caused minor damage to a single family residence, and pushed a mobile home off its foundation. Upon crossing CR 40, the tornado tore almost the entire roofing structure off a single family home, injuring one inhabitant, and tossing the debris into the trees behind it. The tornado continued over a small hill into a hollow, snapping and uprooting numerous trees along its path.  The tornado continued into Wayne County Tennessee, approximately 1/2 mile north of CR 40.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Very heavy rainfall began in the mid evening hours across the northern portions of the county, while additional thunderstorms developed over central Fort Bend County and moved into Harris County from the southwest. A period of thunderstorm cell training occurred from around 10 PM to 1 AM from Fort Bend County into north-central Harris County where the cells merged with the line of storms moving southward from northern Harris County. Thunderstorm cell mergers continued over central and southwest Harris County for several hours resulting in widespread significant flooding. The Houston/Galveston National Weather Service Office issued their first ever Flash Flood Emergency for this event. The area's worst flooding was focused across the western portion of Harris County from the northwest side of the City of Houston to Addicks to Sharpstown to Richmond in central Fort Bend County. Hundreds of water rescues (mainly motorists stranded on area freeways and roadways) were performed by various agencies during the height of the rainfall. After daylight on the 26th, the Houston Fire Department responded to many requests for assistance of residences in flooded homes. Seven fatalities were directly related and one additional fatality was indirectly related to the flooding. Three fatalities resulted from the capsizing of a Houston Fire Department rescue boat in Brays Bayou and the other four were all flooded vehicle related. Rainfall totals averaged 3 to 4 inches across much of Harris County with totals of 4 to 6 inches from Humble to Jersey Village to Katy, and then eastward to Galveston Bay. Rainfall totals of 8 to 10 inches were recorded on the northwest side of the City of Houston southwest to Sugar Land. A maximum rainfall accumulation of 11 inches was recorded at Brays Bayou and Beltway 8. A CoCoRaHS observer 6.2 miles west of Downtown Houston recorded 10.03 inches of rainfall. Another observer 3.4 miles northeast of Richmond in Fort Bend County recorded 11.88 inches of rainfall. Maximum rainfall rates included 4.8 inches in one hour, 8. 3 inches in three hours, and 10.1 inches in six hours. The combination of the heavy rainfall and associated overflow of area creeks, rivers and bayous caused flood damage to thousands of homes and close to 100 commercial buildings.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flash flooding occurred across the central and eastern part of the county.

A maximum rainfall accumulation of 11 inches was recorded at Brays Bayou and Beltway 8. A CoCoRaHS observer 6.2 miles west of Downtown Houston recorded 10.03 inches of rainfall. Another observer 3.4 miles northeast of Richmond in Fort Bend County recorded 11.88 inches of rainfall. Maximum rainfall rates included 4.8 inches in one hour, 8. 3 inches in three hours, and 10.1 inches in six hours. The combination of the heavy rainfall and associated overflow of area creeks, rivers and bayous caused flood damage to thousands of homes and close to 100 commercial buildings.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rain produced flash flooding in and around the city of Houston that caused numerous creek and bayou overflows.  Multiple water rescues were conducted.  Numerous roads were impassable due to flooding that was as high as six feet deep.  Hundreds of vehicles were stranded in the flood water.  Flood waters inundated at least 2,585 homes and 73 commercial buildings. Many bayous, including Brays, Keegans, Buffalo (610 Loop to Downtown Houston), White Oak, Armand, and Halls were out of banks. Additional flooding occurred along Brickhouse Gully, South Mayde Creek, San Jacinto River, Clear Creek, Rummel Creek, Willow Water Hole, Cypress Creek, Little Cypress Creek, Willow Creek and Spring Creek.  There were six directly related drowning fatalities.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Rainfall totals of 10 to 13 inches were reported upstream in southern Blanco County and all of this water entered the Blanco River and Little Blanco River. The Fischer Store Rd. bridge over the Blanco River was destroyed by flood waters west of Wimberley. The Blanco River, down stream from the bridge, at Wimberley reached a record crest. The gauge failed at 40 feet and the USGS later estimated the crest at 44.9 feet with 175,000 cfs. This height was more than 10 feet over the previous record height of 33.3 feet from 1929. Homes along the banks of the Blanco River from the City of Blanco, through Wimberley, and down to San Marcos experienced an historic flood.  Many homes were totally destroyed and swept down stream.  Many homes were struck by large debris, including full size cypress trees which typically lined the banks of the river.  A house in the 100 block of Deer Crossing Ln. in Wimberley was washed away in the flood with nine people inside. There was one lone survivor while eight others died. Six bodies were recovered and the two small children remain missing.  Several of the bodies were recovered near San Marcos Texas nearly 30 miles downstream. Another fatality occurred when a man was washed away with his vehicle. He was 29 years old and was found on May 26 near FM 2325.  A 74 year old male also drown after he was swept off his roof of his house along River Road near Wimberley. The river experienced rises that exceeded 20 feet in one hour.  Estimates of insured losses are around 100 million dollars.  Overall in Hays County including Wimberley and San Marcos, 321 homes were destroyed, with hundreds more heavily damaged.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Based on radar estimates, over 6 inches of rain fell over several hours along and just to the south of Interstate 10, just to the west of Desert Center. According to a trained weather spotter about 4 miles west of Desert Center, the eastbound lanes of Interstate 10 collapsed where they crossed a heavily flowing wash, and one vehicle drove into the hole in the collapsed bridge. The driver became trapped by crushed asphalt and needed to be rescued. The injured driver was extracted from his truck and taken to a local hospital. According to local law enforcement, Interstate 10 was closed in both directions; water was flowing over the highway and the on and off ramps were flooded. Traffic was backed up for miles and needed to be re-routed. Within a short distance of the collapsed bridge, water flowing through a wash and under the freeway severely eroded and compromised the integrity of a second bridge; the second bridge did not collapse however. Interstate 10 will be closed in both directions for quite some time, probably at least one week, as bridges on both sides of the freeway will need to be re-built. A Flash Flood Warning was issued for the area from 1621PST through 1915PST.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Multiple bridges on the east side of Gallup were closed as arroyos were running higher than they have in 5 to 10 years, according to the emergency manager.  Another area of heavy rain flooded a barn along with 2 pastures east of El Morro.  Each flooding case subsided by the 5th.  A 65 mph wind gust also occurred as a result of a wet microburst in south central New Mexico.

Only a few showers and storms were associated with the warm front. ||Rounds of showers and thunderstorms formed in the lower Ohio River Valley and moved quickly into western West Virginia during the evening of the 2nd.  These rounds continued into the morning of the 3rd, before a lull in the early and mid afternoon.  Rain totals of 1.25 to 1.5 inches was common by midday on the 3rd in southwestern West Virginia. ||Additional rounds of showers and thunderstorms moved across during the evening hours.  This was ahead of a low pressure wave along a strong cold front.  Dew points were in the upper 50s with temperatures in the 60s. The evening convection was elongated along the flow in portions of Wayne, Lincoln and Boone Counties.  Rain amounts as high as an inch were observed in an hour, with 2 inches in less than 3 hours. Rain totals over a 24 to 30 hour period were mostly 2 to 3 inches.  A few gauges had more than 3 inches.  For example, the cooperative observer at Madison had 3.55 inches for a rain total.  Flooding of small streams was common.  A woman drowned in Wayne County.||Eventually, a federal disaster was declared for a few counties in southern West Virginia.  See FEMA DR-4219 for more information.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous streams overflowed and blocked roads.   Examples were Newcomb Creek and Lynn Creek near East Lynn, Lick and Cove Creeks near Kiahsville, plus Mill Creek near Saltpetre.  Some homes near Kiahsville were impacted. A few homes along Mill Creek were flooded.  Small private bridges were washed out.  Road culverts were damaged.  A couple of vehicles were found in Mill Creek. ||A 62 year old woman tried to walk out of Rowe Hollow in the Amilda vicinity.  She was going to attend a Good Friday evening service at the neighborhood church around 1800E on the 3rd. The unnamed run, that flows out of the hollow and into the East Fork of Twelvepole Creek, was flowing across the dead end gravel road.  Its assigned route number is 701/38. The water was about knee deep. Neighbors were shocked to see her try to walk through the water with her umbrella. She fell down. The water in the road washed her down the road. She could not straighten up. She was swept away and drowned. Her body was found in the East Fork of Twelvepole Creek.||A rain gauge along Mill Creek measured 2.25 inches in 3 hours during the early evening with a 24 hour total of 3.6 inches.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 450.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system had abundant amount of moisture associated with the cold front as the system originated from the North Pacific and was able to tap into tropical moisture. The front produced very heavy precipitation along coastal locations and prolonged moderate rain further inland. The heavy rain produced flooding over the Sitka area and in the Taiya River basin along the Chilkoot trail near Skagway. The strong winds that accompanied the front along with the very high rain fall rates caused several landslides along the central outer coast with three fatalities in Sitka. As the front moved through the inner channels there was a brief strong wind that occurred near Skagway.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A strong cold front with sub-tropical moisture moved into the eastern gulf and moved over the coastal areas of Southeast Alaska. As the front approached the coastal area of Sitka very high rain rates were being reported across the area in the early morning hours which lasted less than 6 hours. In three hours the Sitka airport reported  one point seven inches which was a 25 year rainfall intensity return period. The Sitka Magnetic Observatory Climate Reference Station (CRN), which is closer to steep terrain, reported two point zero one inches was a 45 year rainfall intensity return period. Along with the very high rain rates there was also very strong winds of thirty-three mile per hour with much high wind gusts at higher elevations. The combination of the heavy rain and strong winds caused catastrophic debris flows across the Sitka area on the morning of August 18th. Multiple roads were blocked along with homes damaged or destroyed and  there was 3 fatalities in Cramer Ave slide. A state of emergency was declared and as one point seven million dollars worth of damage was done.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.70M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In Eleva (Trempealeau County), flood waters covered State Highway 93 and U.S. Highway 10 and caused around $400 thousand in damage to a food business. Numerous homes and businesses in Osseo sustained water damage from flooding along the North and South Forks of the Buffalo River. The flood waters covered or washed out numerous roads in Jackson and Clark Counties. Two accidents occurred in Jackson County when people tried to drive their vehicles over water covered roads that had been washed out. The dam at Emerson Lake (Clark County) was damaged by the flood waters with repairs estimated at almost a quarter of a million dollars.

More heating, more instability and plenty of moisture on the 22nd led to scattered thunderstorms across the state.  A few of these storms produced wet microbursts that resulted in significant flooding and wind damage. A series of storms hit the Albuquerque metro area through the afternoon, causing lots of street flooding and uprooting a few trees. One person died as a result of strong flows within the arroyo channels despite best rescue efforts. Flash flooding was also reported just north of Roswell, where reported rainfall amounts exceeded 3 inches over just a two hour span.  There were reports of a few swift water rescues with no injuries or deaths along with many roads being closed. The 2.45 inches reported at a COOP site north of Roswell was the largest single day rainfall total in the month of September since the historic flash flood event of 2013.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Media reports indicated a man was swept away and died in fast moving water that filled the north diversion channel arroyo.  Eye witness reports noted the man was outside the arroyo before somehow ending up in it and being swept away.  Search and rescue attempts by the fire department found the body two hours later in the Rio Grande.  The only other information available at this time is that it was a male between the ages of 20 and 30 years old. The intense rainfall rates also washed lots of landscaping material, including rocks, mud, and fabric material, into streets across the metro area. A water mark near Carlisle and Comanche suggested the water was as high as 2 feet in the intersection. Road crews spent several hours cleaning up streets across the city.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Three day rainfall totals within this swath ranged from 6 to 12 inches, with lighter amounts extending both northwest and southeast to the state border.  Some of the precipitation fell as a wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow across northwest portions of the state.  All of this rain caused historic river flooding for the many rivers throughout the region. This resulted in floods of record on the Bourbeuse River at Union, the Meramec River at Pacific, Eureka, Valley Park, and Arnold, and major flooding on the Missouri River (at Gasconade and Hermann), the Mississippi River at Winfield Lock and Dam and points downstream, the Cuivre River at Old Monroe, Dardenne Creek, the Gasconade River, the Moreau River, the Illinois River, and the Kaskaskia River at Vandalia.  The only location not reporting flooding after this event was the Salt River near New London, where the Clarence Cannon Dam regulates the flow.  All other forecast points reported at least minor flooding. Seven flooding deaths were reported in our area due to the heavy rains. Approximately 1500 structures were either damaged or destroyed by the flood waters in the forecast area. At this time dollar amount damages are expected to top $1 billion dollars.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Up to four inches of rain fell causing flash flooding. Numerous roads were flooded. In Grafton, a 42 year old woman was walking home, possibly intoxicated. She was last seen on North Cedar Street at about 11 pm on December 26th, 2015. Authorities suspected she tried to cross a flooded roadway near a creek and was swept out to the Mississippi River and drowned. Her body was finally located March 10th, 2016 about 6 miles downstream. Cause of death was accidental drowning.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The heaviest rainfall occurred in a 50 to 75 mile wide swath from southwest Missouri through the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area and into central Illinois.  Three day rainfall totals within this swath ranged from 6 to 12 inches, with lighter amounts extending both northwest and southeast to the state border.  Some of the precipitation fell as a wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow across northwest portions of the state.  All of this rain caused historic river flooding for the many rivers throughout the region. This resulted in floods of record on the Bourbeuse River at Union, the Meramec River at Pacific, Eureka, Valley Park, and Arnold, and major flooding on the Missouri River (at Gasconade and Hermann), the Mississippi River at Winfield Lock and Dam and points downstream, the Cuivre River at Old Monroe, Dardenne Creek, the Gasconade River, the Moreau River, the Illinois River, and the Kaskaskia River at Vandalia.  The only location not reporting flooding after this event was the Salt River near New London, where the Clarence Cannon Dam regulates the flow.  All other forecast points reported at least minor flooding. Seven flooding deaths were reported in our area due to the heavy rains. Approximately 1500 structures were either damaged or destroyed by the flood waters in the forecast area. At this time dollar amount damages are expected to top $1 billion dollars.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Automated gauges in the area only measured about an inch of rain between 3 pm and 8 pm. However, this was enough for Louse Creek to rise, covering Farthing Road at a low water crossing, about half a mile north of intersection with Britt Road. A family of 5 was traveling from Kentucky to Minnesota and somehow got lost after getting off of I-57. The family ended up about 2 miles southeast of Patoka, going north on Farthing Road. In the dark, the driver probably did not see the rushing water over the roadway before it was too late. The vehicle was carried about 150 to 200 feet downstream and became lodged in some trees. An occupant of the vehicle called 911 about 730 pm, but shortly after a firefighter arrived on the scene, the car became dislodged and sank.  Dive teams recovered the car from the water several hours later. All 5 occupants were pronounced dead from drowning just before midnight.  The flooding did not affect any structures in the area, just road flooding in a few locations. Also, this area of flooding was well removed from the axis of the heaviest rain that stretched from the eastern Ozarks into central Illinois.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Strong surface cyclogenesis took shape during the day, allowing ample moisture to return northward with strong southerly flow. At the same time, a strong upper level shortwave trough allowed strong mid level westerlies to overspread much of the Plains region.

The first storm developed near Lawton and moved northeast along I-44 into parts of central Oklahoma, resulting in several tornadoes and large hail. Additional supercells spawned tornadoes across northern Oklahoma, and the slow moving nature of storms lead to several occurrences of flash flooding.

This combination led to thunderstorms that produced heavy rain and isolated severe weather.  A historic flash flood occurred on the Blanco River late Saturday night into Sunday.  Hundreds of homes were destroyed along the river from the City of Blanco down into Wimberley and San Marcos.  The flood wave continued downstream for days affecting residents and homes along the San Marcos and Guadalupe Rivers.  Early estimates show damages in excess of 100 million dollars.  Several people lost their lives due to flash flooding.  A large tornado outbreak occurred this Saturday night producing numerous small brief tornadoes.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Thunderstorms produced heavy rain that caused flash flooding of the Little Blanco River.

Damage surveys confirmed four tornadoes. Along with the severe weather, excessive rainfall resulted in widespread flash flooding along the Interstate 35 corridor Friday morning.  Rainfall rates on the order of 5-7 inches per hour fell from San Marcos up through South Austin.  Historic rainfall totals fell at the Austin Airport where over 1 foot of rain fell within a few hours time.  12.49 inches of rain for Oct 30 was the most ever in one day for Austin.  Other daily rainfall totals exceeded 15 inches.  Record flooding occurred in southern Travis County and portions of Hays County.  River and creek flooding was extensive across Hays, Travis, Bastrop, Caldwell, and Comal Counties.  Many areas, especially in San Marcos, compared this flooding to the record flooding of Oct 1998.  Estimates of 2000 homes were flooded in or near this I-35 corridor, many of them destroyed or sustained Major damage.  Estimates of insured losses were not available as of this writing, but the counties experienced monetary losses in the tens of millions.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A man drown when his vehicle was flooded and he was swept downstream on Dry Creek just west of Highway 183 in southern Travis County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The main band of heavy rain extended from northwest of Cedar Hill southeastward to southeastern Jefferson County, south of Festus. Four vehicles were swept off of Meyer Road, just west of intersection with U.S. Highway 67, when Buck Creek rose well above its banks. All four vehicles were swept downstream but only two were occupied, the other two had been in a nearby parking lot. Two bodies were found further downstream, a 35 year old female and a 50 year old female. Authorities say that the owners of the other two vehicles have been accounted for. Several rescues had to be performed including on Montauk Drive just off of U.S. Highway 67, about 2 miles north northeast of Olympian Village. Also, a levee was over topped on Plattin Creek next to Lakeside Manor Mobile Home Park. Four to five feet of water flooded the mobile home park. Sixty to seventy people had to be rescued. Three people were injured and brought to a local hospital. Numerous businesses were flooded. One business had about a dozen ATVs damaged or ruined by the flood waters. Mercy Hospital in Crystal City had to close its emergency department for a couple of days when flood waters came into that area of the hospital, the rest of the hospital remained open. Several homes along Cotter Creek, off of Hillsboro Victoria Road near intersection with Highway P, were damaged/destroyed from flood waters as the creek quickly rose there. One person had to be rescued after her vehicle was swept into Cotter Creek by the flood waters. She was clinging to a tree for over an hour before being rescued. Several roads were washed out due to the flash flooding. Damage to the roads and bridges was estimated around $1.5 million with total damage estimated close to $3-4 million.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
