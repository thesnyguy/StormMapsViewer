They had just come ashore and were securing their boat as the storm hit.  Both men, ages 35 and 21, were knocked on their back by the bolt and were momentarily paralyzed.  There were holes in their clothing where the electricity passed through.  They both had reddish streaks resembling sunburn stretching from their left armpit to their right leg.  They were treated for 2nd degree burns at a local hospital.  One of the victims had been struck by lightning once before in 8th grade while camping.  In Anne Arundel County, numerous trees were downed by high wind.  Poplar trees were downed by Annapolis Mall and power outages were reported.  A wind gust of 60 MPH was estimated in Annapolis where pea sized hail fell.  A wind gust of 45 MPH was reported in Rivera Beach where pea sized hail was also spotted.
