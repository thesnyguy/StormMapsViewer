Flooding damaged approximately 4,050 structures throughout the county, resulting in $62.1 million in property damage and and at least $20 million in crop damage. There was more than 700 swift water rescues in Cumberland County alone. The flooding resulted in 2 direct fatalities. A 81 year old female was found dead inside her vehicle in the 100 block of Rhodes Pond Road. After flood waters receded, a 53 year old male was found less than 100 yards away from his vehicle near the Clinton Road exit on the southbound side of I-95.  There were also 2 indirect fatality.  A 63-year-old man died several days later from a pre-existing health condition after he was unable to refill his prescription medication due to flooded and impassable roadways. The second indirect fatality occurred several weeks later when a construction equipment operator died while repairing an earthen dam damaged by Hurricane Matthew. The victim was operating a Bobcat when the equipment overturned, trapping him underwater at McFayden Lake.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 62.10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Besides the 11 direct fatalities, at least 3 indirect fatalities also occurred. ||In addition, the associated strong wind gusts of 50 to 70 mph resulted in 1 fatality, when a tree fell onto a moving vehicle. Finally, the associated EF-1 tornado in Wayne County resulted in $75 thousand in property damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Torrential rainfall of 12 to 15 inches caused widespread flash flooding across the county. Additional rainfall upstream caused all-time record major flooding along the Neuse River near Goldsboro. Flooding damaged approximately 5,092 structures throughout the county, resulting in $120.8 million in property damage and and at least $20 million in crop damage. Numerous roads were closed due to flooding. Numerous homes and businesses were flooded as well, with more than 125 people rescued from trapped homes and vehicles. There were 2 direct fatalities when a 54 year old male and a 47 year old female when their vehicles were swept away by flood waters along Wayne Memorial Drive near County Day Road.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 120.80M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ���It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn���t go back.���||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged. In the worst cases, sections of road bed were washed away.  Public bridges and small private bridges were damaged or destroyed. Large debris piles collected against bridges. Countless vehicles were flooded.  Electricity and water were lost for days in the hardest hit flood areas.         ||The American Red Cross had over 800 workers helping at its peak.  They distributed over 7,500 cleanup kits and over 100,000 meals and snacks.  Many church based organizations and ordinary individual citizens volunteered their time and services to help in the flood recovery.  Nationally known celebrities and sport figures, with ties to West Virginia, also helped to raise awareness and increase donations for flood recovery.||The state transportation secretary estimated 8 million dollars in damage to roads in Clay County, 8 million dollars in Nicholas, over 13 million in Kanawha County.||Several schools were severely damaged by flood waters. This included in Clay County, White Elementary and the county bus garage. In Kanawha County, Herbert Hoover High School, Clendenin Elementary, Elk Valley Christian School, plus Bridge Elementary Schools were severely damaged.  Water from the Elk River crested about 7 feet deep in the first flood at Herbert Hoover High School. In Nicholas County. Richwood High and Middle School was severely damaged.  Moderate flood damage occurred to Clay High School and Elkview Middle School.  Minor flood damage occurred at Middle Birch Elementary School in Braxton County.  Minor flood damage also was seen in Ansted Elementary in Fayette County and Glade Elementary in Webster County.||A state of emergency was declared by Governor Tomblin.  At its peak deployment, around 650 members of the West Virginia Army National Guard and West Virginia Air National Guard were activated.  Major tasks assigned to the guard troops included delivering supplies to residents with no road access, and removal of flood debris.  Private contractors were also used for debris removal. In just Kanawha County, 15,000 tons of flood debris were collected.       ||A federal disaster was quickly declared by President Obama.  At least 8 counties were eligible from the events of June 23rd and 24th within the forecast area of the National Weather Service in Charleston. They included Jackson, Roane, Kanawha, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties.  See FEMA disaster number 4273-DR for more information.  Over 4900 individuals applied for federal assistance from those 8 counties, totaling over 20 million dollars.  Public assistance for debris removal, emergency protective services, roads, bridges, and schools, was over 50 million dollar in those same 8 counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The flood of record occurred on the lower Elk River around Clendenin.  ||Two women died. They were trying to save family heirlooms in the basement of a home in Elkview.  In likely their last cell phone contact, 1 of the 2 women described the scene, as like the Titanic. An elderly man also died in his home in Elkview.  Another young woman died, but the situation was unknown. | |Both the flash flooding and the river flooding were severe, but the amount of damage from the record river flooding was likely higher in Kanawha County, than the damage from the flash flooding.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 36.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.

Rainfall ranged from 2 to 4 inches on the southern beaches to 8 to 12 inches inland. This rain led to significant flash flooding over  much of eastern North Carolina during the afternoon of October 8th through the morning of October 9th. Many roads were washed out and impassable for days from the serious flash flooding. Devastating river flooding then occurred several days after Matthew as most main-stem rivers exceeded major flood levels. Strong winds of 40 to 60 mph inland and 60 to 80 mph along the coast occurred as Matthew passed offshore mainly during the evening of October 8th through the morning of the 9th. These winds led to numerous downed trees and power lines across the region with widespread power outages that lasted several days in some areas. Storm surge inundation was mainly 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the coast, however inundation of 3 to 5 feet above ground level was observed on the sound side of the Outer Banks. ||There were six confirmed fatalities across the area with five in Lenoir County and one in Pitt County.

As water drained into the local rivers, record levels were recorded along the Amite and Comite Rivers, with flooding far exceeding the 1% annual risk flood plain. Portions of interstates 10 and 12 were closed due to high water on the roadways as crests moved downstream. In all, approximately 25,000 homes and hundreds of additional businesses suffered various degrees of flooding, though it's difficult to determine how many were due to initial flash flooding and how many were due to subsequent river flooding. Due to the extremely high water levels on the Amite river, water flowed back upstream on many streams and bayous, leading to a significant back water flooding problem. Much of the flooding in the southern part of the parish was due to this back water flooding. The end time of the flood is based on when Bayou Manchac near Little Prairie dropped below flood stage. However, some back water flooding continued on the Bluff Swamp for several more days. Four fatalities are attributed to the flooding. A 58 year old man drowned near the Mallard Lakes subdivision off Hoo Shoo Too Rd, likely some time the morning of Sunday 8/14. He was last seen late Saturday night riding a 4-wheeler.

The system tapped into deep tropical moisture resulting in very intense rainfall across a large portion of the area. Two-day rainfall totals of 10 inches or more were common across areas generally to the west and northwest of Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas. The heaviest rainfall occurred across a swath of East Baton Rouge, Livingston, and St. Helena Parishes, where 20 to 30 inches fell over a 48-hour period, topping the 0.1% annual exceedance probability. The heavy rainfall led to widespread flash flooding and record river flooding. Many of the broken records had been set during the flooding of April 1983. In total, 12 people died in southeast Louisiana as a result of the flooding. The event was also responsible for an estimated total of ten billion dollars in damage across southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi. This estimate includes impacts of both the initial flash flooding and the resultant river flooding.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Twelve to eighteen inches of rainfall over a 2 day period led to widespread flash flooding across the northwestern half of Tangipahoa Parish, details of which are contained in the flash flood report for the parish. As water drained into the local rivers, major to record flooding occurred along the Tangipahoa River. Flooding far exceeded the 1% annual risk flood plain. Interstate 55 was closed from exit 50 to exit 53 between Fluker and Arcola due to water over the roadway.  Additionally, the entirety of Interstate 12 through Tangipahoa Parish was closed as flood crests on both the Tangipahoa and Natalbany Rivers pushed high water onto the roadway.  The end time of the event is based on when the Tangipahoa River near Robert dropped below moderate flood stage, though minor lowland flooding continued beyond this date. In all, 11,000 homes and businesses suffered various degrees of flooding throughout the parish, though it's difficult to determine how many were due to initial flash flooding and how many were due to subsequent river flooding. One fatality is attributed to the river flooding. A 20 year old woman was found drowned in her vehicle in the Cherokee Beach area where Hwy 442 crosses the Tangipahoa River.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 315.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A cold front stalled across the Lower Ohio and Mid-Mississippi Valleys, where tropical moisture was already in place. Precipitable water values from 2.25 to 2.5 inches were common. A sub-tropical low pressure system that produced torrential rains along the Gulf of Mexico coast then turned north, eventually getting pulled northeast across Missouri along the stalled cold front. This low brought copious amounts of moisture. Showers and isolated thunderstorms brought torrential downpours between the 13th and 17th. Rainfall amounts during this time ranged from 5 to 10 inches north and west of Cape Girardeau, including the Poplar Bluff and Perryville areas. There were isolated reports of 12 to 17 inches in the Ozark foothills, including Doniphan and Greenville.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Moderate flooding occurred along the Black River, resulting in one fatality and some flooded homes. Several homes were evacuated, and there was considerable flooding of streets and highways. In Poplar Bluff, portions of several streets were flooded with several feet of water, mainly those streets with river frontage. A city riverside park was flooded. Southeast of Poplar Bluff in a rural area, individuals were evacuated from a home on County Road 611, and homes on County Road 608 were threatened. Just east of Poplar Bluff, a water rescue of a flooded home was conducted near the intersection of Missouri Highway B and County Road 559. Flooding of farmland was rather extensive south and southeast of Poplar Bluff. Floodwater from the river eventually shut down Highway 53 near the Black River bridge between Qulin and Poplar Bluff. The flooding was exacerbated by a levee breach at County Road 202 near Qulin. A 44-year-old woman was possibly attempting to find an alternate route around the flooding when her car became submerged on County Road 647 near Highway 53. The incident occurred on the night of the 16th. The vehicle and its deceased occupant were located on the afternoon of the 19th. At the Poplar Bluff river gage, the river crested at 20.28 feet on the afternoon of the 16th. Flood stage is 16 feet.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

During the day a strong low level jet pumped very moist air into the region. The jet and a west to east stationary front were the triggers for thunderstorms that developed later in the day. Rounds of thunderstorms brought some damaging winds to parts of northwest Wisconsin late Monday afternoon and evening. These storms were followed by evening storms that began training as the night wore on. The training storms resulted in very heavy rain over the region. Historic flooding followed the extremely high average rainfall amounts of 4 to 8 inches.

The initial squall line of storms brought down many trees. The effects of the wind and a raging, flooded Oronto Creek caused enormous damage at Saxon Harbor.

A large complex of thunderstorms moved southeast across southeast Missouri during the evening hours of the 29th. The storms occurred near a surface cold front which sagged southward across southern Missouri during the evening. This deluge of heavy rain brought flash flooding to the Ozark foothills.

This complex occurred along the same front, which moved back north as a warm front across southeast Missouri. These storms caused considerable flash flooding. They also accelerated rises in area rivers, which were already above flood stage in some cases. The rainfall total for the three-day period from April 28 to April 30 was 12.25 inches at Ellsinore in Carter County from the public. A public report of 12.01 inches was received from Old Appleton, near the Perry / Cape Girardeau County line. In Perryville (Perry County), a Cocorahs observer measured 9.87 inches. North and west of a line from Dexter to Sikeston, there were numerous reports of rainfall in the 5 to 10 inch range, including 9.60 inches at Williamsville (Wayne County), 9.21 inches at Patterson (Wayne County), 8.90 inches at Van Buren (Carter County), 7.76 inches at Marble Hill, 6.54 inches at Poplar Bluff, and 5.65 inches at the Cape Girardeau riverfront.

At the Poplar Bluff river gage, the river crested at 21.96 feet late on the morning of the 1st. This crest was only a few inches below the record crest of 22.15 feet, set in March of 2008. The main levee from Poplar Bluff to the Qulin area was under extreme stress. One section of levee broke in the vicinity of County Road 608, requiring eight houses to be evacuated. The levee was overtopped in more than a dozen spots. The part of the levee protecting Poplar Bluff, including the downtown area, was overtopped in a couple of places. Police and firefighters went door-to-door on the south side of Poplar Bluff advising residents of a levee breach just outside the city limits. Some homes in the flood plain were flooded, mostly in rural areas south of Poplar Bluff. Areas of south central Butler County were evacuated. A total of about 54 homes were damaged, and two were destroyed. About 10 businesses were damaged. A Red Cross shelter at the Black River Coliseum sheltered about 80 residents. There were two fatalities as a result of the river flooding. The first drowning victim was a 69-year-old woman, whose body was recovered from inside her vehicle on May 2 but who actually drowned on April 30. Her vehicle was swept off a county road outside of Harviell. The second drowning involved a 60-year-old man, whose truck was washed off Route 53 into a ditch near County Road 618.  Most area schools were closed during the crisis. Grain bins were flooded, though some of the crop was removed before the flooding could damage it. Numerous state and county roads were closed, including Highway 53. Parts of Qulin were flooded. Between Qulin and Neelyville, residents of the Coon Island area were evacuated. In the Neelyville area, about a half dozen or so people were evacuated by boat. Damage to public property alone was estimated at nearly two million dollars.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The sixth named storm, third hurricane, and the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Florence originated from a strong tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on August 30, 2018. Florence became a tropical depression near Cape Verde on August 31 and progressed west-northwest, becoming a Tropical Storm on September 1. Florence strengthened rapidly on September 4���5, becoming a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. Florence weakened to a tropical storm by September 7, but the system regained hurricane strength on September 9 and major hurricane status with winds of 140 mph on September 10. However, increasing wind shear caused the storm's winds to gradually weaken over the next few days. However, the storm's wind field continued to grow. By the evening of September 13, Florence had been downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. Hurricane Florence made landfall near Wrightsville Beach early on Saturday September 15, and weakened further as it slowly moved inland.||Florence produced extensive wind damage along the North Carolina coast from Cape Lookout, across Carteret, Onslow, Pender and New Hanover counties. Thousands of downed trees caused widespread power outages to nearly all of eastern North Carolina. The historic legacy of Hurricane Florence will be record breaking storm surge of 9 to 13 feet and widespread devastating rainfall of 20 to 30 inches, locally up to 36 inches, which produced catastrophic and life-threatening flooding. The hardest hit areas included New Bern, Newport, Belhaven, Oriental, North Topsail Beach and Jacksonville, along with Downeast Carteret County, or basically south of a line from Kinston to Cedar Island.

The heaviest rain occurred Saturday and Sunday (Oct 6-7). By Tuesday night (October 9th) more than 11 inches of rain fell in and around the Kansas City Metro. Local drought conditions were still in the Extreme to Exceptional category going into the event, so flash flooding was relatively low impact, relegated mostly to several road closures. The bigger impact from this prolonged rainfall event came from local river and stream flooding. Several streams entered the moderate to major flooding category. The 4 day event spanning Oct 6-9 resulted in the greatest 4 day rain total in recorded Kansas City History. At Kansas City International Airport 9.79 inches were recorded for the Oct 6-9 time period, beating out Sept 12-15, 1977, which had 9.48 over the 4 day span.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> From FOX 4 Kansas City: Miami County Sheriff���s Office confirmed to FOX4 that a missing 78-year-old woman has been found dead.

According to deputies, someone noticed the roof of a silver car showing after flood waters in the area receded and alerted authorities. Osawatomie Fire Department pulled the car from the water and determined it belonged to Phillips. Phillips was still inside. Phillips��� family reported her missing Wednesday.

The rainy weather pattern that dominated January and February became less active in March. The winter of 2018-19 ended up being the fourth wettest winter on record at Paducah, where records go back to 1937. February was the second wettest February on record at Paducah. Record rainfall in the Cumberland and Tennessee Valleys sent a large volume of water into Kentucky and Barkley Lakes. Both lakes crested around 367 feet, 8 feet above their summer pool stage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A prolonged major river flood that peaked in February subsided in March. Information on the February crest height and the total property damage estimate is contained in the February report. The flood damaged about 50 homes in McCracken County. Levee and flood wall gates were installed in the Paducah area. This action along with heavy rainfall in west Kentucky and backwater from the Ohio and Tennessee Rivers caused widespread flooding in the southeast part of McCracken County. Smaller rivers and creeks such as the Clarks River had nowhere to drain and kept rising with each successive round of heavy rain. One fatality occurred due to a vehicle that drove into Clarks River floodwaters. A male, age 59, drove around a barricade and into floodwaters off Highway 787 near the Marshall County line. His girlfriend escaped the vehicle, but he did not. His body was recovered and CPR was administered but to no avail. Countywide, a damage assessment indicated 35 residences sustained minor damage and 15 sustained major damage. Numerous roads were closed around the county, especially in the flood plain west of Paducah and the Clarks River basin in eastern McCracken County. Some of the largest state roads that were closed included Highway 131 south of Reidland, Highway 305 in West Paducah, and Highway 284 between Reidland and Paducah. A Red Cross shelter was opened in Paducah. The City of Paducah declared a state of emergency and installed most of the floodgates in the floodwall. The city's convention center was inaccessible for over a week due to its location outside the floodwall. A makeshift barrier was installed around the convention center to prevent flooding.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A cold front brought additional rainfall through the afternoon and evening, before drier conditions worked into eastern Kentucky during the morning of February 21. ||Rain quickly spread back north that evening into the 22nd with southeastern Kentucky continuing to see prolonged light rain into the afternoon of the 23rd. A cold front brought additional rain to much of eastern Kentucky late on the 23rd. ||A spike in moisture ahead of this front resulted in additional moderate to heavy rain and high rainfall rates across portions of eastern Kentucky late on the 23rd. The convection ahead of the cold front that evening resulted in the majority of the flooding and flash flooding issues across eastern Kentucky. Showers and thunderstorms capable of heavy rainfall trained over parts of Wayne, Pulaski, Rockcastle, and other counties along the I-75 corridor, resulting in deadly flash flooding and river flooding along the Cumberland River. Later in the evening, the bulk of the rainfall shifted north to counties along the Mountain Parkway. Flash flooding and river flooding occurred in Powell, Wolfe, Breathitt, Magoffin, and Johnson Counties. Lighter rainfall continued into the night as flooding issues remained widespread into the 24th.||Rainfall amounts from this event ranged from near 2 inches in portions of the Bluegrass region and northeast Kentucky, to greater than 4 inches across locations in southern and southeast Kentucky. ||This additional water on top of saturated ground continued to promote mud and rock slides across eastern Kentucky, complete with power outages from fallen debris and trees. Pikeville experienced a massive rockslide early on February 22, resulting in several cars and a building being damaged. Other impacts included countless roads being inundated with standing water, pavement and water pipes breaking, water threatening homes, roads and bridges being washed away, and rising lake levels.||Of the 33 counties across eastern Kentucky, at least 27 were forced to declare State of Emergencies due to rainfall during and before this event. This included Knott County due to over $150,000 in county road damages. Beattyville, Clay City, Harlan, Hazard, Jenkins, Monticello, Paintsville, Pikeville, Salyersville, Stanton, West Liberty, and Whitesburg also declared State of Emergencies. Additionally, the Kentucky Governor declared a State of Emergency across the entire Commonwealth.||The persistent rainfall of the winter season and the amount of rainfall from this event led to Lake Cumberland reporting their highest lake level of 756.52 feet on February 26th, breaking the old record of 751.69 feet dating back to May 1984. As a result, Wolf Creek Dam had to release at a record discharge level of 59,880 cubic feet per second. Cave Run Lake also rose to within 6 feet of their record pool elevation. Buckhorn Lake came within 10 feet of their all-time record, partially resulting in Kentucky Highway 257 near Confluence having flood waters cover the highway isolating 40 to 50 families for three weeks following the end of the flooding rains.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A local news media outlet reported that a motorist crashed into Wolf Creek off of Stidham Road south of Cinda. The driver's body was later found trapped inside the car. Additionally, a bystander also died as a result of the flooded creek after he jumped in to try to save the driver. The creek was 3 to 4 times higher than normal, contributing to the death of both men.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

From 4 to 15 inches of snow cover remained across the mid Missouri River valley, and the ground was frozen with existing frost depths of 15 to 23 inches. Warm temperatures allowed all of the snow to rapidly melt and record moisture allowed 1 to 2.5 inches of rain to fall over a 48 hour period.  Due to the frozen ground, and that 1 to 2 feet of thick ice remained in area rivers, widespread, and in many cases, catastrophic flooding developed. Due to expansive levee breaches on many rivers and streams, the flood damage was particularly devastating to many communities. Four individuals lost their lives due to the extreme conditions, and several hundred people required rescue via air or boat. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from their homes or businesses. Nearly 50 levees were breached on the Platte, Elkhorn and Missouri Rivers due to the large volume of water. One such levee breach along the Platte River near Leshara, Nebraska forced the evacuation of National Weather Service Omaha, located in Valley, Nebraska for 8 days. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts presented US$1.3 billion preliminary damage estimates for the entire state, including specific sector losses of: $439 million infrastructure (including roads and bridges), $85 million private homes and businesses, $400 million livestock and $440 million crop. About 2,000 miles of state roads including 15 Nebraska state highway bridges and numerous local bridges, roughly 20 percent of the entire state road system were impacted. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds provided a $1.6 billion preliminary damage estimate due to flooding across the state. U.S. Interstate 29, extending north-south along the Missouri River, was inundated and partially destroyed, as was the Interstate 680 bypass around Council Bluffs-Omaha metropolitan area. Also noteworthy was damage to Offutt Air Force Base located near Bellevue, Nebraska. One-third of the base���s main runway was inundated, along with one-third of Offutt���s buildings, with several hundred employees, and several families displaced. Preliminary damage estimates released by the Department of Defense are on the order of $450 million. Nebraska and Iowa severe flooding impacts culminated in Federal Disaster Declaration 4420.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is for flooding along the Loup River. The river gage at Columbus, operated by the Nebraska DNR, peaked at 19.39 feet at 5 am on March 15th. Major flood stage is 20 feet. Preliminary this peak is the 2nd highest on record. This flooding caused substantial damage to the area, specifically on the river side of the levee around Columbus. This damage was the result of both ice jam and open water flooding. Several businesses and homes were destroyed and many people needed to be rescued. The water got within 1 to 2 feet of the top of the levee and never got into Columbus.  One woman was killed by flood waters in her home.  Rescuers could not get to her home due to extreme weather conditions.  Property damage amounts represent amounts for the entire county.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 440.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Antecedent conditions from the rainfall earlier this month and at the end of April meant that soil moisture was already high, and any additional rainfall would quickly become runoff. Antecedent river and lake levels were also above normal ahead of this active storm period. Six to sixteen inches of rain fell between May 18th and May 30th along and northwest of a line from near Okmulgee, OK to near Bentonville, AR, and three to five inches of rain fell southeast of this line. Widespread ten to sixteen inch amounts fell across portions of southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma. During this period, six USACE Tulsa District flood control reservoirs set new pools of record in northeastern Oklahoma: Kaw, Keystone, Skiatook, Birch, Oologah, and Hudson Lakes.||The result was 31 river floods at 22 river forecast points in eastern Oklahoma. There was a total of 54 crests during those 31 floods, two of which were new records (Arkansas River near Ponca City, and Bird Creek at Avant), and 25 of which were crests in the major flood category. Fourteen of the 31 floods lasted seven days or more; eleven lasted ten days or more; two lasted fourteen days or more; and one lasted 21 days or more.

Severe flooding occurred along the Arkansas River in Tulsa County, with some homes in south Tulsa and Bixby flooded. Riverside Drive in Tulsa was closed in places. A man fell into the river in Tulsa on the 26th, and another waded into the river. Both men drowned. Monetary damage from this flood is unknown.

Due to the frozen ground, and that 1 to 2 feet of thick ice remained in area rivers, widespread, and in many cases, catastrophic flooding developed. Due to expansive levee breaches on many rivers and streams, the flood damage was particularly devastating to many communities. Four individuals lost their lives due to the extreme conditions, and several hundred people required rescue via air or boat. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from their homes or businesses. Nearly 50 levees were breached on the Platte, Elkhorn and Missouri Rivers due to the large volume of water. One such levee breach along the Platte River near Leshara, Nebraska forced the evacuation of National Weather Service Omaha, located in Valley, Nebraska for 8 days. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts presented US$1.3 billion preliminary damage estimates for the entire state, including specific sector losses of: $439 million infrastructure (including roads and bridges), $85 million private homes and businesses, $400 million livestock and $440 million crop. About 2,000 miles of state roads including 15 Nebraska state highway bridges and numerous local bridges, roughly 20 percent of the entire state road system were impacted. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds provided a $1.6 billion preliminary damage estimate due to flooding across the state. U.S. Interstate 29, extending north-south along the Missouri River, was inundated and partially destroyed, as was the Interstate 680 bypass around Council Bluffs-Omaha metropolitan area. Also noteworthy was damage to Offutt Air Force Base located near Bellevue, Nebraska. One-third of the base���s main runway was inundated, along with one-third of Offutt���s buildings, with several hundred employees, and several families displaced.

From 4 to 15 inches of snow cover remained across the mid Missouri River valley, and the ground was frozen with existing frost depths of 15 to 23 inches. Warm temperatures allowed all of the snow to rapidly melt and record moisture allowed 1 to 2.5 inches of rain to fall over a 48 hour period.  Due to the frozen ground, and that 1 to 2 feet of thick ice remained in area rivers, widespread, and in many cases, catastrophic flooding developed. Due to expansive levee breaches on many rivers and streams, the flood damage was particularly devastating to many communities. Four individuals lost their lives due to the extreme conditions, and several hundred people required rescue via air or boat. Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from their homes or businesses. Nearly 50 levees were breached on the Platte, Elkhorn and Missouri Rivers due to the large volume of water. One such levee breach along the Platte River near Leshara, Nebraska forced the evacuation of National Weather Service Omaha, located in Valley, Nebraska for 8 days. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts presented US$1.3 billion preliminary damage estimates for the entire state, including specific sector losses of: $439 million infrastructure (including roads and bridges), $85 million private homes and businesses, $400 million livestock and $440 million crop. About 2,000 miles of state roads including 15 Nebraska state highway bridges and numerous local bridges, roughly 20 percent of the entire state road system were impacted. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds provided a $1.6 billion preliminary damage estimate due to flooding across the state. U.S. Interstate 29, extending north-south along the Missouri River, was inundated and partially destroyed, as was the Interstate 680 bypass around Council Bluffs-Omaha metropolitan area. Also noteworthy was damage to Offutt Air Force Base located near Bellevue, Nebraska. One-third of the base���s main runway was inundated, along with one-third of Offutt���s buildings, with several hundred employees, and several families displaced. Preliminary damage estimates released by the Department of Defense are on the order of $450 million. Nebraska and Iowa severe flooding impacts culminated in Federal Disaster Declaration 4420.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is for flooding along the Shell Creek. The river gage near Columbus, operated by the USGS, peaked at 22.21 feet at 7:30 am on March 14th. Major flood stage is 22 feet. Preliminary data shows that this peak is the 2nd highest on record.  US Highway 81 was flooded over from high waters from Shell Creek.  Much rural property was inundated by flood waters.  A bridges were taken out by flooding. A Columbus man drowned on the 14th  while driving his tractor north on, 175th Avenue and over the Shell Creek Bridge. The bridge gave way and the man was swept away by flood waters.  Dollar amounts for the county are included in the Loup River flood entry.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An upper level disturbance ejecting northeast ahead of the trough across portions of East Texas and North Louisiana during the early morning hours of April 13th carried enough elevated instability, shear, and forcing north of an advancing warm front over Southeast Texas and South Louisiana, such that scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developed, with numerous reports of large hail and occasional damaging winds received. The warm front continued to gradually mix north northwest into East Texas and Northcentral Louisiana by late morning and early afternoon hours, with a very warm, moist, and unstable air mass noted over Deep East Texas and portions of Northcentral Louisiana south of the front. Coupled with even stronger forcing and low level shear ahead of the approaching upper trough, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed near and south of the front from late morning through the afternoon, producing several reports of damaging winds across portions of Northcentral Louisiana. These storms also produced locally heavy rainfall that led to instances of flash flooding, which resulted in two separate fatalities in Ouachita Parish. A 13 year old boy drowned in a drainage canal in the Bawcomville community during the heavy rains, and an 80 year old female drove past barricades on a closed road in Calhoun several hours after the heavy rains had ended, with her car becoming submerged in the flood waters.

The Sheriff said these individuals went missing around Noon CDT on 9/9/20. The vehicle was located just off a roadway in high level and rapid moving water on FM1226 just south of County Road 266. With the assistance of Anson Volunteer Fire Department, Texas Game Wardens and Anson EMS, it was determined that the vehicle was not occupied. Due to weather conditions, water level and speed in which the water was flowing, personnel were instructed to return to the area the following morning, 9/10/2020, during daylight hours. Just before noon Thursday, September 10, 2020, a resident used his drone to help rescuers scan the area. They located the body 100 yards away from the car in a flooded field near a fence. They found the deceased body in a field the next day on 9/10 and it was a 71 year old male. At approximately 3:30 pm, on 9/16/20, the body of a 62 year old male, who was a passenger in the same vehicle, was recovered in the Red Mud Creek area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This continued through February 7th, highlighted by heavy rainfall from the evening of February 5th through the first half of February 6th. Rain amounts of 4-6 inches fell across much of southeastern Kentucky over this period. This led to major flooding and numerous mudslides across portions of Whitley, Perry, Letcher, Leslie, Knox, Harlan, Clay, and Bell Counties. The Governor subsequently declared a State of Emergency for these 8 counties.||Major flooding occurred along the Cumberland River at Pineville, Barbourville, and Williamsburg. Additionally, the communities of Loyall and Baxter experienced major flooding. Numerous roads became impassable across large portions of Whitley, Knox, Clay, Leslie, Letcher, Harlan, Perry, and Bell counties. In particular, Harlan County was hit extremely hard with the Kentucky Mesonet site on Black Mountain (4031 foot elevation) receiving over 6.5 inches of rain over this stretch. ||Flood gates were closed in Pineville and Harlan, further impacting local travel. A couple of mobile homes were flooded and swept down the Cumberland River in Harlan County, while swift water rescues took place in Bell and Harlan Counties. Elkhorn Dam in Jenkins had water rushing over it for a period of time on February 6. A man went missing in Whitley County and was later found deceased in his car on Kentucky Highway 779 after his attempt to drive into flood waters. A total of seven homes were reported to have been in or under water across Whitley County as the Cumberland River in Williamsburg crested to its third highest stage on record of 34.84 feet. The city of Pineville saw the river rise to its second highest crest in history at 1019.06 feet, leading to several families being stranded without homes.||While impacts were certainly greatest along the Cumberland River, several portions of the Kentucky River also flooded. Several roads were impacted in Hazard and Whitesburg, while Booneville, Heidelberg, and Ravenna also exceeded flood stage. Along the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River, a rarity occurred as Pikeville hit flood stage and forced the city to shut its flood gates.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Emergency Management reported extensive flooding in Williamsburg and elsewhere across Whitley County, especially east of town. Several swift water rescues were performed with one woman being diagnosed with hyperthermia. At least 38 homes were inundated with water, with six of these being completely under water. Many businesses also sustained extensive water damage, especially along the Cumberland River basin. Several local residents rate this as the second worst flood in their memory, right behind that of the April 1977 flood.||On February 10th, a man was found dead inside his vehicle on Kentucky Highway 779. He apparently attempted to drive through flood waters on his way to work on February 6th.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Snow levels rose to near 5000 feet.   The heavy rain and snow melt lead to moderate flooding and several landslides along the East Slopes of the Washington Cascades. There was record flooding on several rivers, including the Umatilla, Walla Walla and Touchet rivers with widespread flooding of numerous other creeks and streams and rivers across Umatilla, Union and Wallowa Counties of Oregon and Walla Walla and Columbia Counties of Washington. Initial Weather Conditions February 1, 2020, snowpack across along the East Slopes of the Washington Cascades ranged from 80 to 100 percent of normal.   Across the northern Blue Mountains of Oregon and northern Blue mountains of Washington the snowpack was near normal. A weather system brought heavy snow to this region on February 4th and the first part of the day on February 5th with snow amounts from around 10 to 20 inches for locations between 2000 to 4000 feet. During the afternoon of the 5th, snow changed to rain at elevations below 5000 feet.  Selected locations snow amounts for February 4-5, include 8 inches at 2.6 miles SSE of Snoqualmie Pass, 7 inches at Cle Elum, 2 inches at Easton, 12.5 inches at Ski Blue Wood and 2 inches at Dayton in Columbia County. For Oregon, snow amounts include, La Grande 7-10 inches, Summerville 10 inches, La Grande, 5 Miles NNE- 17.5 inches, Meacham 13 inches, Elgin 9.8 N 8 inches, Joseph 6 inches and Wallowa 8 inches. The rain continued over through February 6 and 7th. Precipitation amounts in the form of rain at the headwaters of the rivers, ranged from 3 to 5 inches.  Rain amounts for the 48 hours ending on the morning of February 8th, for selected locations include 6.31 inches at 2.6 miles SSE of Snoqualmie Pass, 3.27 inches at Easton, 5.83 inches near Lake Cle Elum and 2.17 inches at 8.7 miles NE Dayton.  Snotel sites reported 2 day precipitation amounts of 6.3 inches at Touchet #2 in the Columbia County. There was 1.98 inches over 72 hours at 1.1 NE Walla Walla.   In Oregon, rain amounts for the 48 hours ending on the morning of February 8th for selected locations include:  from Coop Observer, Emigrant Springs ��� 2.82 inches, Union 1.01 inches ,  Cove- 2.48 inches, La Grande - 2.50 inches,  Lostine ��� 1.39 inches.  From CoCoRahs and other public weather spotters, 9.8 N Elgin ��� 5.45 inches, La Grande- 3.02 inches and Wallowa 2.66 inches.  Snotel sites reported 2 day precipitation amounts of 5.9 inches at High Ridge, 3.0 inches at Moss Springs, 1.6 inches at Milkshake. In addition, the snowpack from the preceding day was melted, contributing to the runoff.  Observations show 5 to 7 inches of snow melted from February 5th to February 6th at Easton and Cle Elum. Home owners in the Lake Cle Elum area noted a loss of 3 to 5 feet of snow An observer located 5 miles north of La Grande reported 17.5 inches of snow fell on February 4-5 and then by the morning of February 6th, the snow depth had decreased to around 8 inches and was depleted during the day on the 6th.   Satellite snowpack images show 1-3 inches of snow water equivalent (or water held in the snowpack) melted out along both the east and west sides of the northern Blue Mountains in Oregon and around the foothills of the Grande Ronde Valley generally between 2000 to 4000 feet. Streams, creeks and rivers rose rapidly through the night of February 5th, with the first instance of flooding reported on early morning on February 6th.  The streams and rivers continued the rapid rises through the day on February 6th, with the Umatilla River reaching record high water levels at the gaging sites near Gibbon and at Pendleton and moderate flooding on the Grande Ronde River at the gaging sites near Perry and Troy. Most rivers and streams crested overnight on February 6th or on the morning of February 7th and then slowly receded back below flood stage on February 8th and 9th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Umatilla County ��� There was record flooding along the entire reach of the Umatilla River.  There was extensive damage to areas along the river, including homes, roads including Interstate 84, railroads  as well as other public facilities such as parks and sports complexes.  Along the upper reaches of the river, roads were washed out with homes damaged or destroyed.  One resident was swept away by flood waters and died.  A number of residents had to be evacuated via helicopter or 4 wheeler with 70 homes on the Umatilla Indian Reservation damaged.  The Riverview Mobile Home Park at Pendleton was inundated.  There was minimal to no damage through Pendleton, due to the levee, but the Bob White Baseball field had extensive damage as water overtopped a low wall.  Adjacent to Pendleton, the levee was damaged and overtopped with water flowing through the Keystone RV Manufacturing plant and the Colby Pipe Company.  Several bridges and roads downstream from Reith to Echo were damaged or washed out with a number of homes damaged.   Downstream from Echo to the confluence of Columbia River, the river rose out of the banks and flooded Interstate 84 between Highway 395 and Highway 208.  Several semi-trucks were stranded in the flood waters with extensive damage to the highway.  Numerous pastures and buildings along the river through Stanfield were flooded with extensive damage to Oxbow Park in Hermiston and to a sports complex in Umatilla. There was extensive flooding as well as on the Walla Walla River from the headwaters through Milton Freewater and on the upper reaches of Mill Creek.  Numerous levees along the Umatilla and Walla Walla Rivers were damaged or overtopped including near Milton Freewater, several locations on the Umatilla Indian Reservation and adjacent to Pendleton.

A warm front moved northward into Middle Tennessee early on March 27 before stalling near the I-40 corridor. Between 300-400 AM CDT, numerous showers and thunderstorms developed along the warm front, many of which became severe and produced large hail up to half dollar size along with frequent lightning and heavy rainfall. Showers and storms continued off and on the rest of the day across Middle Tennessee, particularly near the stalled warm front. In fact, another round of severe thunderstorms including supercells developed during the afternoon and evening hours near and south of the warm front. These storms dropped large hail up to tennis ball size and caused a few reports of wind damage, but the main impact was additional heavy rainfall which began causing flash flooding south of Nashville. Flooding only worsened as showers and storms redeveloped over the same areas through the evening, with numerous Flash Flood Warnings issued and several reports of flooded roads and water rescues.||After midnight, even more heavy rainfall falling along the already waterlogged I-40 corridor prompted a rare Flash Flood Emergency for the southern and eastern Nashville metro area, including southeastern Davidson County, western Wilson County, and northern Williamson County. These areas received between 7 to 9 of rain, causing rapid rises on several Nashville metro creeks and streams, including Sevenmile Creek (which reached its highest level on record), Browns Creek, and Mill Creek, among others. Many of these creeks reached within their 2nd or 3rd highest water levels on record. The rapid water rises flooded hundreds of homes and businesses, with reports of some people trapped in the attics or on the roofs of their houses. Dozens of roadways were flooded and impassable, including both I-24 and I-40, with many cars submerged in the flood waters and people forced to cling onto trees to avoid getting swept away. Although the flood waters receded quickly on Sunday, March 28, many area rivers reached flood stage in the week after the event, including the Cumberland River, Harpeth River, and Duck River.||A total of 7 deaths were reported from the flooding across Middle Tennessee, with 5 in Davidson County, 1 in Cheatham County, and 1 in Maury County. Emergency management reports indicate over 500 homes and businesses were flooded, and a Presidential Disaster Proclamation was declared for many counties in May 2021. This flash flood event was the worst seen in Middle Tennessee since the May 1-2, 2010 flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A man drowned in his vehicle after driving around high water barricades into flood waters on Tennessee Waltz Parkway near Highway 12 in Ashland City.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One fatality was associated with record flooding of Rayse Creek near Mount Vernon.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Several streets on the south side of Mt. Vernon had standing water over them. Record flooding occurred on Rayse Creek in southwest Jefferson County. A motorist drowned after driving into the creek flooding on a county road south of Woodlawn. The incident occurred during the early morning hours of the 17th following the heavy rain on the 16th. The vehicle and driver were swept away in the creek. Both were recovered a couple days later. The storm total rainfall southwest of Mount Vernon was 6.0 inches, both at Scheller and Marcoe.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 30.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Most notably within this line of storms was a cluster of QLCS tornadoes that formed in Grundy County. There may have been other tornadoes associated with circulations that were noted on radar, but emergency management confirmed damage consistent with tornadoes near Trenton and Laredo Missouri. Most of the damage was minor, but some grain bins being blown off their foundation was the highlight of the damage in the area. Rainfall was the other big story with this event as some areas received 6 to 10 inches of rain. Despite the excessive rain, the flash flooding was rather minor, however there were still numerous roads closed, and areas near Excelsior Springs were especially hard hit as the Fishing River rose out of its banks. Another semi-dramatic event occurred along I-29 just north of St. Joseph, where a crane that was being used to do road construction became unbalanced and tipped.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Well after rain had ended, Castille Creek was high enough to cover the road at County Line road.

This second atmospheric river episode of the month was a set of three atmospheric rivers back-to-back-to-back. Water vapor transport into Western Washington averaged 160 - 200% of normal during the period of 11 November - 16 November. Heavy rainfall spread across the region on the night of the 11th through November 12, with the heaviest rain starting across Southwest Washington and slowly shifting to the north through the day. Rainfall totals ranged from 5 to 10 inches in spots leading to areal and river flooding, including major flooding. |Heavy, persistent rainfall associated with the Atmospheric River shifted northward across Western Washington on November 13 before stalling over northwest Washington November 14 through 16. Another 5 to 10 inches of rainfall fell across the northern half of western Washington. The snow level rose to 8000 to 10,000 feet, resulting in some snow melt contributing to runoff.  Widespread minor or greater flooding occurred. Major flooding occurred on the Bogachiel, the three forecast points on the Nooksack, Skagit, and Cowlitz Rivers. Moderate flooding occurred on the Elwha, Skokomish, Skykomish, Snohomish, Snoqualmie, Puyallup, Nisqually, Newaukum Rivers and South Prairie Creek. Preliminary record flows occurred on Nooksack, Bogachiel, Calawah Rivers and Olsen Creek. Hundreds of water rescues and two fatalities took place during this time period.
