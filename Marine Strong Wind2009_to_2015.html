An associated strong pressure gradient and lingering unstable conditions over Lake Michigan allowed strong gusty north to northeast winds to mix down to the lake surface.  The lake surface temperature at this time was estimated to be in the 54 to 58 degree range.  Wind gusts reached 50 to 70 mph along the lake shore.  The strong winds caused high waves of 12 to 16 feet.  The strong winds and high waves caused extensive damage to boats in the South Shore Yacht Club, mainly due to an eroding and failing breakwall protecting the southern part of Milwaukee Harbor.  Three boats were totally destroyed at the yacht club.  Four others were washed ashore and were able to be salvaged.  Two of the destroyed boats were sunk.  One person at the Club, while trying to secure a boat with a rope line, was tossed about on the boat due to wave action and injured (directly-related).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Measured at MLWW3 marine observation platform.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
