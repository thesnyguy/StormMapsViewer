Other thunderstorms developed over portions of east central Illinois and northwest Indiana. The major threat was heavy rain which produced widespread street flooding.  There were also reports of thunderstorm wind damage.  The line of thunderstorms continued to march east through northeast Illinois and northwest Indiana and by early afternoon the line had pushed east of the region.  By mid afternoon a second line of thunderstorms crossed the Mississippi river into western Illinois and other storms developed over east central Illinois and northwest Indiana. The storms continued to move through the area into early evening.   The two lines of thunderstorms produced widespread tree damage.  There were also a few reports of lightning damage associated with these storms.  Flash flooding was a serious problem as a considerable amount of rain had fallen recently in addition to heavy rains associated with these storms.  The storms produced several weak tornadoes over Livingston County Illinois.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tree was down on a car with a person trapped inside.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The frontal system that had moved through the state on the night of the 22nd was returning north as a warm front.  This time Iowa did not get completely into the warm sector.  The surface front was dragged north into Iowa by low pressure that moved out of Kansas northeast into central Iowa by the mid to late evening.  The airmass was pushed southeast out of the state by a cold front that passed through the state during the evening and early morning hours.  The airmass in the warm sector became very unstable.  Lifted indices were around -13 C with CAPE values greater than 5000 J/kg by the late afternoon.  The air advected north into Iowa during the day and into the evening.  Thunderstorms erupted in two places.  The first to affect the DSM CWA was the development of several elevated supercells over west central into southwest Iowa.  The storms continued to lift east and northeast across the area.  A few tornadoes touched down, however with the very elevated nature of the storms it was very difficult for the tornadoes to reach the ground.  By the late afternoon, a solid squall line developed along the cold front.  The line took on a Line Echo Wave Pattern by evening.  Several segments of the line bowed out, resulting in high winds.  At times the winds reached 80 MPH.  One of the thunderstorms produced high winds in the Early area of Sac County.  They overturned a semi-tractortrailer truck, causing $80,000 damage and causing minor injuries to the driver.  Tornadoes that formed along this line actually formed where the Rear Flank Downdraft cut through the line.  A clear meso was formed and the small tornadoes advanced around the meso and were in front of the thunderstorm line.  Touchdowns were all brief.  Hail was common with the stronger storm, with much of it in the one to one and three-quarter inch in diameter.  Given the antecedent soil conditions in Iowa, flash flooding became a major issue.  Numerous counties reported flash flooding as rainfall of one to 4 inches in spots resulted in flooded highways.  The thunderstorms formed into an MCC by the early evening hours.  As they moved out of the state, they delivered one more punch to the state.  High winds developed in the wake of the complex.  Several counties of north central, northeast, and central Iowa received high winds.  Damage occurred in several locations to both trees and out buildings.  Sustained winds across the area were in the 25 to 45 MPH range with some higher gusts.  Clarion reported a wind gust of 63 MPH for the highest wind gust reported.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 80K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

All three men pinned in the rubble were injured. One man required air med-evac to Wesley Medical Center in Wichita where, upon arrival, he was listed in critical condition. (By Friday Night, his condition had been upgraded to "fair".) A 2nd required ambulance transport to Via Christi Regional Medical Center in Wichita where he was listed in fair condition. The 3rd man did not seek medical attention. In addition, the following sustained significant damage: 12 homes, 4 businesses (including the Elko Building on west side of town that lost a 20 by 30 foot section of roofing on the west side of the structure causing the west wall to buckle inward), one shop, a camper that was blown over and rolled nearly 100 feet, and the roof of a carport that was dislodged and blown over the roof of the mobile home to which it had been attached. Obviously, damage to trees, power lines, and power poles was extensive. The latter two severed power to Harper for approximately 5 hours.

A few intense microbursts with winds over 70 MPH were embedded within the line. The brunt of the damage was in a swath extending from southwest of Mount Vernon (including Perry County) across Franklin and Saline Counties to Gallatin and White Counties. The first intense microburst was about 5 miles east of Sesser in Franklin County, where three camper trailers were damaged at Wayne Fitzgerrell State Park and a dozen trees were blown down. One of the campers was overturned onto its top. Two persons in campers received broken bones, but the injuries were not life-threatening. The dimensions of this microburst, with peak winds of 75 MPH, were about 200 by 300 yards. A larger and more intense downburst occurred in Gallatin County at New Haven. Estimated winds to 105 MPH downed numerous trees, including at least 10 that fell on houses. A couple of trailers were reportedly overturned. The dimensions of the damage area were about 4 to 5 miles long and 200 yards wide. Across Franklin, northern Williamson, Saline, Gallatin, and White Counties, trees were down across primary roads. In Williamson County, trees were blocking Interstate 57 around mile marker 60, and Route 37 was blocked at the Franklin County line. Other fallen trees resulted in vehicle accidents with injuries. About 2 miles north of Harrisburg in Saline County, two vehicles collided with a fallen tree that was blocking Route 34. In White County, one fatality occurred when a vehicle ran into a fallen tree (indirect storm fatality). A total of six persons were involved in this fatal accident on Route 1 near Norris City. A tree fell on one car, and then a second car collided with the tree. Some of the six people were injured and trapped in their vehicles. Near the Gallatin/White County line, trees blocked Route 141 leading to the Wabash River bridge. Across southern Illinois, most damage to  structures was caused by falling trees,  however three barns were damaged directly by wind north and east of Tamaroa in Perry County. Pieces were blown 200 yards from the barn. Multiple trees were blown down across Jefferson, Franklin, Jackson, northern Williamson, northern Saline, White, and Gallatin Counties, as well as north of Pinckneyville in Perry County. A number of trees landed on vehicles and houses. In Benton (in Franklin County), an 85-foot oak tree landed across a house and four vehicles, extensively damaging or destroying the vehicles. Separate from the widespread wind damage, a supercell thunderstorm developed in Edwards County, then moved east across Wabash County and the Wabash River. This storm produced hail the size of quarters in Mount Carmel and golf balls at Allendale. In Edwards County, numerous trees and power lines were blown down, from west of Albion into the city of Albion. Across most of Wabash County, numerous trees were blown down, causing many power outages.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 70K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The event transitioned from small hail events and individual thunderstorm downbursts producing minor damage to a large scale high-wind event sweeping rapidly east away from the parent thunderstorms.  Widespread winds of 60 to 70 mph occurred with swaths of stronger winds reaching over 90 mph.  Tree damage was extensive over a 10 county area with some trees 18 to 24 inches in diameter being snapped off above ground.  Numerous reports were received of small buildings and sheds destroyed along with widespread roof damage.  Power poles were also either pushed over or broken, resulting in areas of power outage for 1-2 hours.  A huge cloud of dirt was raised as the strong outflow raced eastward, likely enhanced by several years of dry soils. Visibility was instantly reduced to near zero with law enforcement and rescue personnel stating it was difficult to see beyond the vehicle hood when driving.  Two fatalities were reported on Interstate-70, including the death of a Kansas state senator, whose vehicle was struck from behind by a semi-trailer as he slowed down in reduced visibility.  Other vehicular accidents also occurred on county highways resulting in minor property damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Widespread tree damage in town with 6-8 inch diameter branches down.

The event transitioned from small hail events and individual thunderstorm downbursts producing minor damage to a large scale high-wind event sweeping rapidly east away from the parent thunderstorms.  Widespread winds of 60 to 70 mph occurred with swaths of stronger winds reaching over 90 mph.  Tree damage was extensive over a 10 county area with some trees 18 to 24 inches in diameter being snapped off above ground.  Numerous reports were received of small buildings and sheds destroyed along with widespread roof damage.  Power poles were also either pushed over or broken, resulting in areas of power outage for 1-2 hours.  A huge cloud of dirt was raised as the strong outflow raced eastward, likely enhanced by several years of dry soils. Visibility was instantly reduced to near zero with law enforcement and rescue personnel stating it was difficult to see beyond the vehicle hood when driving.  Two fatalities were reported on Interstate-70, including the death of a Kansas state senator, whose vehicle was struck from behind by a semi-trailer as he slowed down in reduced visibility.  Other vehicular accidents also occurred on county highways resulting in minor property damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Small building destroyed and boy was struck in the head by flying 2x4 board.

A complex weather situation was in place due to the convection from the previous night.  An outflow boundary extended east to west across northern Missouri.  The synoptic frontal boundary extended from central Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The air was clear over Iowa during the day, allowing for temperatures to recover.  Dew point values also recovered quite rapidly with readings in the upper 60s to low 70s by the late afternoon hours.  Lifted indices dropped into the -5 to -10 C. range by evening with CAPE values approaching 5000 J/kg.  By the evening hours, the frontal boundary and outflow boundary had converged and were located along Interstate 80.  Explosive thunderstorm development took place during the very late afternoon and evening hours in spite of the weak shear profile.  Discrete supercells formed in a narrow line along Interstate 80 from near Des Moines on west.  The storms became tornadic quickly.  To add insult to injury, a strong thunderstorm complex formed over Nebraska and moved east along the line of convection over Iowa.  As the event took shape, all modes of severe weather occurred.  The storms developed so rapidly that there was little more than a half hour from the first hail and wind report to the first tornado touchdown.  Hail and high wind reports were too numerous to mention individually here.  Numerous reports of golf ball size hail were received.  Boone and Story Counties reported some of the largest hail with the event as baseball size hail pelted the are.  There was one report of very large hail northwest of Slater in Story County.  Hail five and one half inches in diameter punched 8 holes through a steel roof.  There was severe house siding and roof damage in the area.  There were numerous tornadoes, especially in the central Iowa Iowa.  At one point there were several supercells around the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Two of the stronger tornadoes touched down west and south of Des Moines.  Fortunately, most of the tornado tracks were over open areas and resulted in little damage.  High winds became a problem, especially after sunset, as the complex from Nebraska moved in.  The system became more of a derecho during the late night hours.  Eighty plus MPH winds pelted southwest Iowa and downed barns and several buildings in Adams and Cass Counties.  A beta bow element formed in central Iowa shortly before midnight.  The bow echo produced a measured wind gust of 106 MPH in northern Warren County.  The high winds continued to push east along Interstate 80 for the next hour or so before it started to weaken.  The other major problem was with heavy rain.  The convection from the previous night set the stage by saturating soils.  The echos trained for several hours across central Iowa with very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall rates of 4 to 5 inches per hour were common under the heavier cells.  Several locations received 2 to 5 inch rainfalls in under  two hours, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  Reports of major highways being inundated by water were common.  By the end of the night, a swath of 4 to 9 inch rainfall was evident north of Interstate 80.  Longer term river flooding became a major problem by the morning of the 23rd.  There were two lightning related injuries.  Two people were injured when they were struck by lightning out of doors in Nevada.  The lightning struck close by as they were carrying groceries into their home.  The jolt caused them to fall, resulting in laceration to the head.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first tornado touched down  about 1.5 miles north of Taylor (Jackson County) around 6:22 p.m.  It caused intermittent damage during the first two miles of its path as it moved east southeastward across Highway 95.  It then strengthened and stayed on the ground for another 3 miles.  Many trees were knocked down, and it also demolished a garage and took the roof off two other structures. The tornado reached F1 strength (estimated 75-85 mph winds) briefly as it moved through the Davis and Taylor Road areas where it demolished a garage approximately 2 miles northeast of Taylor. This tornado appeared to lift approximately 4 miles east of Taylor around 6:28 p.m. About 3 tenths of a mile to the south of where the first tornado lifted, a second tornado formed. This tornado primarily caused tree damage. Shortly after formation, it reached F1 strength (estimated 80-100 mph winds), clearing out a path about 30 yards wide through a wooded area just north of West Pine Creek Road. This tornado weakened about 5 miles east of Taylor, but caused sporadic F0 damage until it finally lifted around 6:32 p.m. about 8 miles east of Taylor in the East Pine Creek Road area.  Total path length of these two tornadoes was nearly 9 miles. They were on the ground for about 10 minutes. A third tornado quickly developed about 3 miles west of Warrens (Monroe County) near Arctic Road, just west of Interstate 94 around 7:00 p.m.  It hit a home along Interstate 94, then crossed the Interstate hitting a semi-truck, before moving into Jellystone Campground just west of Warrens.  The tornado and associated strong winds around the storm knocked down hundreds of trees in this area, and damaged several tents, buildings, campers, and cars in Jellystone Campground.  One gentleman was seriously injured when a tree fell on him during a rescue attempt.  He was in a coma for a period of time, but survived with lasting disabilities.  The tornado continued just southwest of Warrens and hit a home, blowing the roof off, south of the village along County Road O.  It lifted about 2 miles southeast of Warrens around 7:12 p.m.  The tornado path was approximately 4.5 miles in total length, with a maximum width of 50 yards. The tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Damage Scale. Wind speeds were likely 90 to 112 mph, with most of the damage related to downburst winds around the actual tornado.  At least 3 people were hospitalized briefly for injuries, but there no fatalities. The fourth tornado formed in extreme eastern Juneau County, about 2 miles west of Castle Rock Dam. The tornado moved east-northeast across Castle Rock Lake and into western Adams County.  It tracked near or along Edgewood Ave, with extensive tree damage to the Quincy Bluff area, including the lookout ranger tower there. Hundreds of trees were blown down from strong winds rotating around the tornadic thunderstorm, which were in excess of 90 mph at times.  The tornado intermittently tracked east to areas just north of Edgewood Drive crossing Highway 13 approximately 5 miles south of Adams/Friendship (Adams County).  Downburst winds on the south side of the storm demolished at least 8 mobile homes in Edgewood Estates that were orientated north-south and took the full brunt of the cross wind.  This was the same area hit by severe weather in September 2000.  Most of the Town of Easton (Adams County) had extensive damage with hundreds of trees down.  It continued to move east-southeast before lifting shortly before the Adams-Marquette County line about 3 miles southeast of Grand Marsh around 7:55 pm.  A broad area of straight line wind damage was found south of this tornado track with widespread tree damage occurring up to 1 mile south of the track.  The tornado path was approximately 17 to 18 miles in length. The tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Damage Scale with estimated wind speeds in the 73 to 112 mph range.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 60K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The injuries were minor, even though the  camper rolled almost three times.  Another camper was damaged, but that camper was unoccupied at the time.  25 to 50 power poles were snapped across Rooks county.  Several buildings in the southern part of the county sustained at least minor damage.  In Phillipsburg, an airplane at the airport was flipped and damaged and numerous large trees were uprooted.  In Smith Center, a large window was blown out of a building on South Main Street.  There were numerous limbs down around that time.  Once the storm reached Jewell and Mitchell counties, a 68 mph wind gust was recorded near Webber and a 76 mph wind gust at Beloit.  Power was out for a time in Beloit.  Several large trees were toppled and there were several instances of minor damage throughout the town.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The occupants of a camper overturned by strong thunderstorm winds were slightly injured.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 75K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The monthly rainfall ranged from a low of4.08 inches in Eastland County to 20.02 inches at Hudson Oaks in Parker County.  Many locations had twice their normal rainfall for the month.  The DFW Airport had the second wettest June on Record, and had measurable rain 18 days, the most days in any month with measurable rain.  These heavy rains produced periodic flash flooding somewhere in North Central Texas nearly every day of the month.  The month began with a northwest flow event on the 1st, with a large hp supercell producing large hail from Jack County southeast to Parker County.  The storm had an erratic southeast movement, but when the storm entered Northern Parker County, it made a left turn and moved nearly due east through Tarrant County, producing countywide wind damage, with measured winds up to 86 miles an hour at the Meacham Airport, some large hail, and flash flood producing rains.   This became the most destructive storm in Tarrant County since the Mayfest Storm on May 5, 1995.  TXU Electric had their worst power outages in the Companies history, as over 500,000 people were without electricity, some for as long as 5 days.  They had to bring in work crews from out of state to help restore power.    Damage estimates for Tarrant County were well over $100,000,000 from this storm.  Sporadic severe weather occurred the rest of the month, but heavy rain and flooding were the main problems.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A mobile home was destroyed by high winds, and two residents inside were seriously injured.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A line of thunderstorms tore the roof from a barn, downed numerous trees and power lines and blew a pickup truck into a ditch as the storms moved through the Wood county communities of Vesper, Nekoosa, and Wisconsin Rapids. Glass fragments caused a minor injury to one of the occupants of the pickup truck.  The storms also produced 7 minutes of dime size hail 1 mile east of Wisconsin Rapids.  The storms also damaged several buildings 4 miles west of Stevens Point (Portage co.), downed trees in Saxeville (Waushara co.) and dropped quarter size hail in Plover (Portage co.).As the storms moved through Portage county three tornadoes touched down.  One of the tornadoes caused minor tree damage in an industrial park in Whiting.  Eyewitnesses observed water being sucked out of a pond at the same time as doors to an office were sucked open.  Another tornado downed several trees, knocked down a fence, damaged the roof of a house and damaged some outbuildings as it passed north of Almond.  The third tornado was the strongest and was on the ground intermittently for 10 miles from southeast Portage county into southwest Waupaca county.  It downed trees and overturned an irrigation system in Portage county.  It strengthened in Waupaca county where it scoured asphalt off a road, destroyed a barn, sheared off the top 50 feet of a silo, crushing three calves, damaged a sheet metal outbuilding and killed 3 sheep.  It tore the roof from a house and destroyed the garage, overturned a semi trailer and moved it 50 feet, blew hay wagons against trees and snapped off or uprooted numerous trees.  Some of the debris from this tornado landed several miles east in the Fremont area (Waupaca co.).A tornado touched down in at least four locations from Little Chute to Kaukauna as the storms moved across Outagamie county.  It toppled or twisted large trees, ripped parts of the roofs from residential and commercial buildings, destroyed storage sheds and an old barn and overturned semi trailers and dropped some of them on other vehicles.A brief tornado touchdown also occurred on the west side of Green Bay (Brown co.) where it caused some tree damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Flooding first developed across the southwest mountains, when several small streams and creeks overflowed their banks, including Toot Hollow Creek near Bryson City. Several rescues were required during the evening in Macon County, as creeks and streams began to threaten homes. Overnight, flooding became more widespread, with Macon County enduring the worst of it. The Little Tennessee River overflowed its banks during the early morning of the 17th, and continued to flood through much of the day. The river flooded an industrial park in Macon County, causing extensive damage. In Swain County, 500,000 gallons of raw sewage and numerous natural gas tanks were swept down the river. Hundreds of structures were damaged or destroyed, and several private bridges were swept away. Portions of highways 105, 64, and 28 were all closed in Macon County, some due to major damage that was estimated to take several months to repair. In addition, a trout farm lost 60,000 pounds of fish.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A mobile home at the base of Fishhawk Mountain was destroyed in the Peeks Creek community.

The deadliest and longest lived tornado started at 1644 CST, 0.7 miles North Northeast of Florid in Putnam County and moved northeast toward Granville.  The long lived nature of the tornado was due to it riding along a warm front pushing through Putnam and La Salle counties.  Satellite imagery indicated a strengthening mesocyclone at 1625 CST (2225 Z) with the formation of a new line of feeder clouds into the supercell, and KDVN 88D velocity data showed a strengthening TVS signature by 1635 CST (2235 Z).	Witnesses reported a multiple vortex tornado just prior to its arrival in Granville.  The tornado hit Granville at 1647-1648 CST which coincided with the failure of the main power feed into town.  The town was bisected by the half mile wide tornado with 12 buildings destroyed, 45 with major damage, and 26 with minor damage (mainly residential).  The Granville State National Bank lost its roof and Hopkins Elementary School lost the roof over the old gymnasium with damage in nearly all the classrooms.  Significant damage also occurred to Granville Drugs, the only drug store in town.  In a strange twist of irony, the town had finally recovered from a major fire 4 years earlier that decimated much of the business district.  The tornado continued northeast out of Granville and crossed over into La Salle County (WFO LOT) at 1653 CST (2253 Z), 3.8 miles Northeast of Granville.	The Granville/Utica tornado was the first significant test of a new statewide mutual aid response agreement.  In Granville 5 people were injured by the tornado, including an eldery female who suffered a heart attack during the tornado and was eventually Life Flighted to a Peoria hospital.  Injuries were low due to the 32 minutes of lead time before the tornado struck Granville. Damage in Granville is estimated to be at least $8 million with the school suffering at least $3.5 million in damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Rated very high end F2<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

As the tornado continued northeast, F2 intensity damage was done to several homes in a subdivision near the intersection of East 250th and 2569th Roads.  Several roofs were blown off homes along with damage to external walls.  Significant tree damage was done as well.  Path width was estimated at 50 yards at this location.

The tornado moved into the southwest side of Utica where it was F0 intensity. Homes along Washington Street only had tree and minor roof damage. A church steeple was damaged on Division between Johnson and Washington. Roofs and trees were more severely damaged on the south side of Johnson Street. The tornado rapidly increased to F3 intensity on the north side of Johnson Street where one home had its roof taken off and north walls blown out. A machinery building was completely destroyed on the south side of the canal and a semi-tractor trailer was blown into the canal. A large grain bin was blown across the canal and flattened. The tornado then moved north of the canal into the heart of town where several homes were severely damaged, garages were destroyed and brick buildings collapsed. Eight people died and seven were rescued from the basement of a turn of the century sandstone building at Clark and Church Streets. The tornado was approximately 250 yards wide at this point. On the east edge of the vortex along Mill Street, in downtown, buildings suffered damage to facades, roofs and windows. East of Mill Street there was damage to trees and minor roof damage. In the northeast section of town a mobile home was overturned on Grove, just east of Mill Street. The vortex crossed the railroad tracks and apparently dissipated on a steep bluff on the northeast side of town.

The team examined a damage path marked by shredded vegetation (mostly mesquite trees),  downed utility poles, agricultural fences, and a complex of destroyed mobile homes that extended over ten miles in a continuous horseshoe shaped path that crossed State Route 208 twenty miles south-southeast of Colorado City.The tornado developed seventeen miles south-southeast of Colorado City around 2028 CST. Damage indicates the tornado's motion was initially toward the southeast then east as it crossed the heavily traveled State Route 208. Two Texas Tech University students traveling north on 208 (south of the tornado's path) watched as a Ford Expedition drove into the tornadic circulation. The large sports utility vehicle was blown 100 yards off of the highway. Evidence supports the vehicle was rolled a considerable distance by the tornadic winds, but it is unclear whether it became airborne. Three motorists were transferred to local hospitals. One person sustained serious injuries that included a broken back.A detailed damage path analysis and corresponding radar data suggest that the tornado then tracked very slowly east a few miles before curving to the northeast. Similar curved damage paths (turning left of the tornado's original motion) are commonly observed when well-developed tornadoes enter the dissipation stage. The tornado proved to remain very dangerous, however, as eight mobile homes were destroyed by the tornado near the end of its life cycle twenty miles southeast of Colorado City. The light weight and unanchored structures were blown over and shredded by the dissipation stage tornadic winds. The trailers were arranged in a complex and were used to provide shelter for groups of hunters that frequent the ranch property.

As the tornado crossed Interstate 80, it overturned  a vehicle pulling a U-Haul trailer. Two children in the automobile were taken to an area hospital, treated for minor injuries and released. The tornado width increased to 1/8 of a mile as it moved northeast of the interstate. Approximately 8 miles WNW of Big Springs, a center pivot irrigation system was overturned, power poles were broken and a couple of old outbuildings lost their roofs. Baseball size hail also fell on the west side of the storm damaging 2 law enforcement vehicles about 12 miles west of Big Springs.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 70K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Three old, unanchored trailer homes were picked up and moved with two of them completely destroyed. A metal shed was tossed 40 yards and numerous trees were broken or uprooted. As the tornado crossed Interstate 80, it overturned  a vehicle pulling a U-Haul trailer. Two children in the automobile were taken to an area hospital, treated for minor injuries and released. The tornado width increased to 1/8 of a mile as it moved northeast of the interstate. Approximately 8 miles WNW of Big Springs, a center pivot irrigation system was overturned, power poles were broken and a couple of old outbuildings lost their roofs. Baseball size hail also fell on the west side of the storm damaging 2 law enforcement vehicles about 12 miles west of Big Springs.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 70K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It initially touched down 3 miles west of Daykin in northern Jefferson county.  The tornado was rated an f0 or f1 in Jefferson county damaging farm outbuildings, grain bins and trees. From there the tornado crossed into Saline county southwest of Western and remained an f0 or f1 until it struck the southern portion of Wilber where it strengthened to f2. Roofs were blown off of homes just southeast of Wilber.The tornado traveled from Wilber into Gage county, crossing the county line west of Clatonia where it grew to its most intense stage, f4.  The tornado remained nearly at this strength as it crossed into Lancaster county near Hallam with a damage path of around 2 1/2 miles.  Many well-built homes were demolished from Clatonia to Hallam, along with grain bins, farm sheds, and outbuildings.  Many trees were destroyed or uprooted.  Although Hallam itself escaped the strongest winds from the storm, which occurred just south of town, 95 percent of the buildings in town were either destroyed or severely damaged.  The lone fatality from the tornado occurred in Hallam.  The storm also toppled several hopper cars from a freight train on the west edge of town.  In total 55 railroad cars were derailed.From Hallam the tornado traveled east for several miles prior to turning northeast again just north of Cortland. The storm then tracked 2 miles north of Firth, severely damaging the Firth-Norris high school and a nearby middle school.  School busses were tossed in this area.  Several homes northeast of the schools were flattened as the tornado regained its f4 strength.The damage path continued northeast to Holland and then to 2 miles north of Panama where the tornado weakened to around an f2 and the damage path began to narrow.  The track then curved more toward the north, passing just south of Bennet where a few homes sustained f3 damage.  After passing south of Bennet, the storm moved back to the northeast and began to weaken to f0 or f1 strength as it crossed into Otoe county southwest of Palmyra.  The tornado finally dissipated 1 miles west southwest of Palmyra.In total the tornado was on the ground for around 54 miles with a maximum intensity of f4.  Besides the fatality, 38 people sustained injuries, 158 homes were leveled and 57 others were seriously damaged. The dollar amount of damage was estimated at 160 million, with 60 million of that agricultural including 100 cattle and 50 hogs lost.  Some 150,000 acres of crop land sustained significant damage.  The 5 counties were declared national disaster areas by Fema.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> See description below<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It initially touched down 3 miles west of Daykin in northern Jefferson county.  The tornado was rated an f0 or f1 in Jefferson county damaging farm outbuildings, grain bins and trees. From there the tornado crossed into Saline county southwest of Western and remained an f0 or f1 until it struck the southern portion of Wilber where it strengthened to f2. Roofs were blown off of homes just southeast of Wilber.The tornado traveled from Wilber into Gage county, crossing the county line west of Clatonia where it grew to its most intense stage, f4.  The tornado remained nearly at this strength as it crossed into Lancaster county near Hallam with a damage path of around 2 1/2 miles.  Many well-built homes were demolished from Clatonia to Hallam, along with grain bins, farm sheds, and outbuildings.  Many trees were destroyed or uprooted.  Although Hallam itself escaped the strongest winds from the storm, which occurred just south of town, 95 percent of the buildings in town were either destroyed or severely damaged.  The lone fatality from the tornado occurred in Hallam.  The storm also toppled several hopper cars from a freight train on the west edge of town.  In total 55 railroad cars were derailed.From Hallam the tornado traveled east for several miles prior to turning northeast again just north of Cortland. The storm then tracked 2 miles north of Firth, severely damaging the Firth-Norris high school and a nearby middle school.  School busses were tossed in this area.  Several homes northeast of the schools were flattened as the tornado regained its f4 strength.The damage path continued northeast to Holland and then to 2 miles north of Panama where the tornado weakened to around an f2 and the damage path began to narrow.  The track then curved more toward the north, passing just south of Bennet where a few homes sustained f3 damage.  After passing south of Bennet, the storm moved back to the northeast and began to weaken to f0 or f1 strength as it crossed into Otoe county southwest of Palmyra.  The tornado finally dissipated 1 miles west southwest of Palmyra.In total the tornado was on the ground for around 54 miles with a maximum intensity of f4.  Besides the fatality, 38 people sustained injuries, 158 homes were leveled and 57 others were seriously damaged. The dollar amount of damage was estimated at 160 million, with 60 million of that agricultural including 100 cattle and 50 hogs lost.  Some 150,000 acres of crop land sustained significant damage.  The 5 counties were declared national disaster areas by Fema.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> See description below.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At the surface a warm frontal boundary extended nearly east to west across the state and provided the focus for thunderstorm development.  By the late afternoon, lifted indices were approaching -10 C. with CAPE values around 5000 J/kg over western Iowa.  Surface temperatures warmed into the upper 80s with dew points in the low to mid 70s.  A southwest surface wind of 15 to 25 kts pushed over the front.  Northeast of the frontal boundary winds were easterly around 10 to 15 kts.  Actually, the surface boundary was further enhanced by outflow from convective complexes during the day, further sharpening the contrast.  Thunderstorms continued to fire along and north of the boundary through the afternoon and into the evening.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding as very heavy rains fell on areas that had had significant rainfall the previous night.  There were reports in north central into northeast Iowa of 2 to 4 inches of rainfall in a little more than an hours time.  Major flooding took place in the Mason City area where evacuations were taking place.  The thunderstorms became most intense during the afternoon into the early evening.  There were several tornadoes across northeast into north central Iowa.  Most were relatively brief touchdowns and were in open areas.  Reports of multi-vortex tornadoes were received from Grundy County.  The days most significant tornado touched down in Pocahontas County east of Rolfe and tracked into Humboldt County through the Bradgate area.  The tornado damaged or destroyed over 75% of the town of Bradgate (pop 120).  Tornado damage in Bradgate was very extensive impacting most of the town.  Hardly a building was not impacted.   Outbuildings, light structures and garages were heavily damaged or destroyed.  Two homes were destroyed.  Several homes were damaged ranging from minor to extensive.  The Survey Team found that the majority of the damage was F1, with a few cases of F2 damage.  The F2 damage was to the snapping of very large trees just west of town and the structural damage to two buildings.  Nearly all of the 53 homes there reported damage with several totally destroyed.  Significant widespread property damage was reported in the tornadoes path.  There were several injuries in the town, the most significant being a broken leg.  A police officer was reportedly hit by debris from the tornado and suffered a broken leg.  According to law officials, the damage path of the tornado was 2 miles wide and about 8 miles long.  Storm chasers on the scene reported the tornado itself to be one half mile wide at one point.  Reports of hail were numerous through the afternoon and evening.  Most of the hail was in the three quarter inch to one inch diameter range.  There were a few reports of golf ball size hail from the stronger storms.  Winds were not a major problem with the activity.  There were spotty reports of winds to around 60 MPH, but most reports were in the 40 to 50 MPH range.  One of the stronger wind reports was a 64 MPH wind gust in Tripoli in Bremer County.  This gust was measured by a mesonet station there.  During the mid evening hours, thunderstorms rumbled across Grundy County.  Lightning struck the Sheriff's office there and destroyed a significant amount of office equipment.  Damage was reported around $100,000.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Tornado intensified as it approached Bradgate.

The first tornado touched down  about 1.5 miles north of Taylor (Jackson County) around 6:22 p.m.  It caused intermittent damage during the first two miles of its path as it moved east southeastward across Highway 95.  It then strengthened and stayed on the ground for another 3 miles.  Many trees were knocked down, and it also demolished a garage and took the roof off two other structures. The tornado reached F1 strength (estimated 75-85 mph winds) briefly as it moved through the Davis and Taylor Road areas where it demolished a garage approximately 2 miles northeast of Taylor. This tornado appeared to lift approximately 4 miles east of Taylor around 6:28 p.m. About 3 tenths of a mile to the south of where the first tornado lifted, a second tornado formed. This tornado primarily caused tree damage. Shortly after formation, it reached F1 strength (estimated 80-100 mph winds), clearing out a path about 30 yards wide through a wooded area just north of West Pine Creek Road. This tornado weakened about 5 miles east of Taylor, but caused sporadic F0 damage until it finally lifted around 6:32 p.m. about 8 miles east of Taylor in the East Pine Creek Road area.  Total path length of these two tornadoes was nearly 9 miles. They were on the ground for about 10 minutes. A third tornado quickly developed about 3 miles west of Warrens (Monroe County) near Arctic Road, just west of Interstate 94 around 7:00 p.m.  It hit a home along Interstate 94, then crossed the Interstate hitting a semi-truck, before moving into Jellystone Campground just west of Warrens.  The tornado and associated strong winds around the storm knocked down hundreds of trees in this area, and damaged several tents, buildings, campers, and cars in Jellystone Campground.  One gentleman was seriously injured when a tree fell on him during a rescue attempt.  He was in a coma for a period of time, but survived with lasting disabilities.  The tornado continued just southwest of Warrens and hit a home, blowing the roof off, south of the village along County Road O.  It lifted about 2 miles southeast of Warrens around 7:12 p.m.  The tornado path was approximately 4.5 miles in total length, with a maximum width of 50 yards. The tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Damage Scale. Wind speeds were likely 90 to 112 mph, with most of the damage related to downburst winds around the actual tornado.  At least 3 people were hospitalized briefly for injuries, but there no fatalities. The fourth tornado formed in extreme eastern Juneau County, about 2 miles west of Castle Rock Dam. The tornado moved east-northeast across Castle Rock Lake and into western Adams County.  It tracked near or along Edgewood Ave, with extensive tree damage to the Quincy Bluff area, including the lookout ranger tower there. Hundreds of trees were blown down from strong winds rotating around the tornadic thunderstorm, which were in excess of 90 mph at times.  The tornado intermittently tracked east to areas just north of Edgewood Drive crossing Highway 13 approximately 5 miles south of Adams/Friendship (Adams County).  Downburst winds on the south side of the storm demolished at least 8 mobile homes in Edgewood Estates that were orientated north-south and took the full brunt of the cross wind.  This was the same area hit by severe weather in September 2000.  Most of the Town of Easton (Adams County) had extensive damage with hundreds of trees down.  It continued to move east-southeast before lifting shortly before the Adams-Marquette County line about 3 miles southeast of Grand Marsh around 7:55 pm.  A broad area of straight line wind damage was found south of this tornado track with widespread tree damage occurring up to 1 mile south of the track.  The tornado path was approximately 17 to 18 miles in length. The tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Damage Scale with estimated wind speeds in the 73 to 112 mph range.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first tornado touched down  about 1.5 miles north of Taylor (Jackson County) around 6:22 p.m.  It caused intermittent damage during the first two miles of its path as it moved east southeastward across Highway 95.  It then strengthened and stayed on the ground for another 3 miles.  Many trees were knocked down, and it also demolished a garage and took the roof off two other structures. The tornado reached F1 strength (estimated 75-85 mph winds) briefly as it moved through the Davis and Taylor Road areas where it demolished a garage approximately 2 miles northeast of Taylor. This tornado appeared to lift approximately 4 miles east of Taylor around 6:28 p.m. About 3 tenths of a mile to the south of where the first tornado lifted, a second tornado formed. This tornado primarily caused tree damage. Shortly after formation, it reached F1 strength (estimated 80-100 mph winds), clearing out a path about 30 yards wide through a wooded area just north of West Pine Creek Road. This tornado weakened about 5 miles east of Taylor, but caused sporadic F0 damage until it finally lifted around 6:32 p.m. about 8 miles east of Taylor in the East Pine Creek Road area.  Total path length of these two tornadoes was nearly 9 miles. They were on the ground for about 10 minutes. A third tornado quickly developed about 3 miles west of Warrens (Monroe County) near Arctic Road, just west of Interstate 94 around 7:00 p.m.  It hit a home along Interstate 94, then crossed the Interstate hitting a semi-truck, before moving into Jellystone Campground just west of Warrens.  The tornado and associated strong winds around the storm knocked down hundreds of trees in this area, and damaged several tents, buildings, campers, and cars in Jellystone Campground.  One gentleman was seriously injured when a tree fell on him during a rescue attempt.  He was in a coma for a period of time, but survived with lasting disabilities.  The tornado continued just southwest of Warrens and hit a home, blowing the roof off, south of the village along County Road O.  It lifted about 2 miles southeast of Warrens around 7:12 p.m.  The tornado path was approximately 4.5 miles in total length, with a maximum width of 50 yards. The tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Damage Scale. Wind speeds were likely 90 to 112 mph, with most of the damage related to downburst winds around the actual tornado.  At least 3 people were hospitalized briefly for injuries, but there no fatalities. The fourth tornado formed in extreme eastern Juneau County, about 2 miles west of Castle Rock Dam. The tornado moved east-northeast across Castle Rock Lake and into western Adams County.  It tracked near or along Edgewood Ave, with extensive tree damage to the Quincy Bluff area, including the lookout ranger tower there. Hundreds of trees were blown down from strong winds rotating around the tornadic thunderstorm, which were in excess of 90 mph at times.  The tornado intermittently tracked east to areas just north of Edgewood Drive crossing Highway 13 approximately 5 miles south of Adams/Friendship (Adams County).  Downburst winds on the south side of the storm demolished at least 8 mobile homes in Edgewood Estates that were orientated north-south and took the full brunt of the cross wind.  This was the same area hit by severe weather in September 2000.  Most of the Town of Easton (Adams County) had extensive damage with hundreds of trees down.  It continued to move east-southeast before lifting shortly before the Adams-Marquette County line about 3 miles southeast of Grand Marsh around 7:55 pm.  A broad area of straight line wind damage was found south of this tornado track with widespread tree damage occurring up to 1 mile south of the track.  The tornado path was approximately 17 to 18 miles in length. The tornado was rated an F1 on the Fujita Damage Scale with estimated wind speeds in the 73 to 112 mph range.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 75K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado traveled southeast for about 2.5 miles, before beginning a temporary eastward jog between county roads 1300E and 1400E. The tornado curved southeast again, striking the Parsons Company, Inc.'s manufacturing plant around 241 pm CDT.  The plant was severely damaged by the tornado.  Approximately 140 people were in the plant at the time, but all personnel made it to storm shelters in time (approximately 3 to 5 minutes before the tornado arrived).  Steel beams and metal siding from the plant were found approximately three quarters of a mile east in a farm field. From the plant, the tornado continued east, just south of Illinois Route 116/117, affecting 4 farmsteads approximately 1/2 to 1 mile east of the plant.  Two of the farmsteads closest to the plant (about 1/2 to 3/4 mile east) had the 2-story houses completely blown away, with only debris remaining in the basements and nearby property.  The other two farmsteads had significant damage to the 2-story houses with outbuildings demolished.  The center of the tornado tracked about 100 yards south of the houses located on the south side of the road.From the plant to the farmsteads, the average width of the tornado was 400 yards and was close to 1/4 mile wide at times.  The greatest tornado intensity was during this approximately 1 mile stretch and has been rated F4 by the National Weather Service.At this point, the tornado began to move more east-southeast and caused significant damage to a barn near the intersection of County Roads 1300N and 1600E, about 2.5 miles southwest of Roanoke. The tornado continued to move east-southeast and damaged a house about 1.25 miles south-southwest of Roanoke, near the intersection of County Roads 1300N and 1700E.  The tornado crossed 1300N shortly afterward and curved sharply to the southeast. The tornado lifted around 254 pm about 2 miles southeast of Roanoke, at County Road 1900E.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A warm front moving north through the area resulted in favorable vertical wind shear to allow for supercell development.The 1st round of severe weather was due to a broken line of intense thunderstorms moving  across Walworth, Milwaukee, Racine and Kenosha counties.  Hail of up to 1 inch in diameter and torrential rainfall accompanied these storms before they moved over Lake Michigan and weakened.  The 2nd round of severe weather was dominated by 2 cyclic supercells - one moved east/southeast through Marquette, Green Lake, Fond du Lac, and Washington Counties, spinning up 5 separate tornadoes, dumping hail stones up to 3 inches in diameter, and hurricane-force downburst winds.  The large hail dented several vehicles.  Two of these were rated F3.  Refer to the individual tornado reports for more details.  A more southerly supercell tracked across extreme southern Sauk County and then made a partial right turn and headed southeast through Dane County, spinning up 2 tornadoes in the process, as well as large hail and downburst winds.  One powerful downburst wind in Madison (Dane Co.) blew equipment off the roof of a business at the Midvale Shopping Mall.  A semi southwest of Ft. Atkinson was blown over by straight-line wind gusts.  This southern supercell eventually spun up another tornado in south-central Jefferson County which moved into north-central Walworth County.  Refer to the individual tornado reports for more details.Both supercells had downbursts that generated large hail and powerful, hurricane-force winds north and south of their tracks.  Over all of Wisconsin, 16 tornadoes were documented on June 23rd, which is the 4th highest single-day total (record is 24 on May 8, 1988).  For south-central and southeast Wisconsin, the 8 tornadoes on June 23rd was tied for the 4th highest single-day total (record is 11 on May 8, 1988).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A strong tornado spun up about a mile directly east of Lake Maria in southeastern Green Lake County, or about 4.2 miles SSE of Markesan, moved east along Sunny Drive with F3 strength (estimated 175-200), and exited Green Lake County along Mielke Rd., or about 6.8 miles SE of Markesan.  Numerous trees were uprooted.   At least 8 homes or ag-buildings had minor damage, at least 5 homes or ag-buildings had major damage, and at least 5 homes or ag-buildings were destroyed.  Near the intersection of Sunny Drive and Pleasant Drive, two people and most basement items were "sucked" out of their home's basement while the home was being destroyed.  The husband was found dead and his wife was critically injured.  Average path width was about 275 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 675K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A warm front moving north through the area resulted in favorable vertical wind shear to allow for supercell development.The 1st round of severe weather was due to a broken line of intense thunderstorms moving  across Walworth, Milwaukee, Racine and Kenosha counties.  Hail of up to 1 inch in diameter and torrential rainfall accompanied these storms before they moved over Lake Michigan and weakened.  The 2nd round of severe weather was dominated by 2 cyclic supercells - one moved east/southeast through Marquette, Green Lake, Fond du Lac, and Washington Counties, spinning up 5 separate tornadoes, dumping hail stones up to 3 inches in diameter, and hurricane-force downburst winds.  The large hail dented several vehicles.  Two of these were rated F3.  Refer to the individual tornado reports for more details.  A more southerly supercell tracked across extreme southern Sauk County and then made a partial right turn and headed southeast through Dane County, spinning up 2 tornadoes in the process, as well as large hail and downburst winds.  One powerful downburst wind in Madison (Dane Co.) blew equipment off the roof of a business at the Midvale Shopping Mall.  A semi southwest of Ft. Atkinson was blown over by straight-line wind gusts.  This southern supercell eventually spun up another tornado in south-central Jefferson County which moved into north-central Walworth County.  Refer to the individual tornado reports for more details.Both supercells had downbursts that generated large hail and powerful, hurricane-force winds north and south of their tracks.  Over all of Wisconsin, 16 tornadoes were documented on June 23rd, which is the 4th highest single-day total (record is 24 on May 8, 1988).  For south-central and southeast Wisconsin, the 8 tornadoes on June 23rd was tied for the 4th highest single-day total (record is 11 on May 8, 1988).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A strong tornado spun up about a mile directly east of Lake Maria in southeastern Green Lake County, or about 4.2 miles SSE of Markesan, moved east along Sunny Drive with F3 strength (estimated 175-200), and exited Green Lake County along Mielke Rd., or about 6.8 miles SE of Markesan.  Numerous trees were uprooted.   At least 8 homes or ag-buildings had minor damage, at least 5 homes or ag-buildings had major damage, and at least 5 homes or ag-buildings were destroyed.  Near the intersection of Sunny Drive and Pleasant Drive, two people and most basement items were "sucked" out of their home's basement while the home was being destroyed.  The husband was found dead and his wife was critically injured.  Average path width was about 275 yards.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 675K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The bulk of the damage and injuries occurred in a neighborhood on the southern half of the Lake of Egypt. The two injured persons were mobile home residents whose homes were demolished. One of the mobile homes was swept clean off its foundation. The demolished home was deposited 50 to 100 yards away. The 32-year-old male occupant of the mobile home, who was ejected from the home, received numerous bruises and cuts. A female resident of another mobile home was injured. In total, three mobile homes were destroyed, and dozens of mobile homes, barns, and sheds were damaged. Rescue efforts were hampered by a large amount of tree debris on roads. Peak winds in the Lake of Egypt neighborhood were estimated near 120 MPH. The tornado lifted as it reached the southeast side of the Lake of Egypt. The parent thunderstorm produced another tornado in northern Johnson County only a few miles beyond where this tornado lifted.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This supercell continued east-southeast across northern Johnson and northern Pope Counties, producing two significant tornadoes and large hail. Although the storm exhibited strong rotation as it continued east through Hardin County and across the Ohio River into Kentucky, no additional tornadoes were reported there.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The tornado turned east-southeast from Williamson County back into Johnson County. The bulk of the damage and injuries occurred in a neighborhood on the southern half of the Lake of Egypt. The two injured persons were mobile home residents whose homes were demolished. One of the mobile homes was swept clean off its foundation. The demolished home was deposited 50 to 100 yards away. The 32-year-old male occupant of the mobile home, who was ejected from the home, received numerous bruises and cuts. A female resident of another mobile home was injured. In total, three mobile homes were destroyed, and dozens of mobile homes, barns, and sheds were damaged. Rescue efforts were hampered by a large amount of tree debris on roads. Peak winds in the Lake of Egypt neighborhood were estimated near 120 MPH. The tornado lifted as it reached the southeast side of the Lake of Egypt. The parent thunderstorm produced another tornado in northern Johnson County only a few miles beyond where this tornado lifted.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Byrne State Forest. The Development Center is a state run home for about 500 developmentally disabled adults. The tornado touched down in a wooded area about one mile south of the intersections of State Routes 70 and 72. A second much smaller and weaker funnel also briefly touched down in that area. The tornado proceeded east through the New Lisbon Development Center where all the property damage and injuries occurred and crossed State Route 72 into the Brendan Byrne State Forest. Two staff members (male and female) were injured. The male was injured when the van he was in was overturned by the tornado. The female was injured when flying glass and debris shattered the windows of the separate vehicle she was in on State Route 72. A thrift store on campus was destroyed and several apartments in the same attached building was also destroyed. None of the residents were injured. The roof and walls from the thrift shop were tossed more than one hundred yards. A metal bench was found in a tree. The tornado also badly damaged the administration center building. A tractor-trailer used for storage near the thrift shop was found in the woods. Several vehicles were overturned. The tornado uprooted and snapped trees, bent bird cage poles and ripped light poles from the ground. One-hundred-year-old trees were snapped. The tornado then proceeded into the Brendan Byrne State Forest where approximately 350 acres of trees were damaged or destroyed. Several hiking trails were closed through the 31st until the debris was cleared. The tornado lifted in the forest, but debris from it fell in Manchester Township in adjacent Ocean County. New Jersey State Route 72 was closed through the night and about 100 people lost power. The tornado was rate an F1 with maximum winds estimated at the high end of the scale, approximately 110 miles an hour. The tornado remained on the ground for about 2.6 miles and its path width was around 100 yards.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A complex weather situation was in place due to the convection from the previous night.  An outflow boundary extended east to west across northern Missouri.  The synoptic frontal boundary extended from central Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The air was clear over Iowa during the day, allowing for temperatures to recover.  Dew point values also recovered quite rapidly with readings in the upper 60s to low 70s by the late afternoon hours.  Lifted indices dropped into the -5 to -10 C. range by evening with CAPE values approaching 5000 J/kg.  By the evening hours, the frontal boundary and outflow boundary had converged and were located along Interstate 80.  Explosive thunderstorm development took place during the very late afternoon and evening hours in spite of the weak shear profile.  Discrete supercells formed in a narrow line along Interstate 80 from near Des Moines on west.  The storms became tornadic quickly.  To add insult to injury, a strong thunderstorm complex formed over Nebraska and moved east along the line of convection over Iowa.  As the event took shape, all modes of severe weather occurred.  The storms developed so rapidly that there was little more than a half hour from the first hail and wind report to the first tornado touchdown.  Hail and high wind reports were too numerous to mention individually here.  Numerous reports of golf ball size hail were received.  Boone and Story Counties reported some of the largest hail with the event as baseball size hail pelted the are.  There was one report of very large hail northwest of Slater in Story County.  Hail five and one half inches in diameter punched 8 holes through a steel roof.  There was severe house siding and roof damage in the area.  There were numerous tornadoes, especially in the central Iowa Iowa.  At one point there were several supercells around the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Two of the stronger tornadoes touched down west and south of Des Moines.  Fortunately, most of the tornado tracks were over open areas and resulted in little damage.  High winds became a problem, especially after sunset, as the complex from Nebraska moved in.  The system became more of a derecho during the late night hours.  Eighty plus MPH winds pelted southwest Iowa and downed barns and several buildings in Adams and Cass Counties.  A beta bow element formed in central Iowa shortly before midnight.  The bow echo produced a measured wind gust of 106 MPH in northern Warren County.  The high winds continued to push east along Interstate 80 for the next hour or so before it started to weaken.  The other major problem was with heavy rain.  The convection from the previous night set the stage by saturating soils.  The echos trained for several hours across central Iowa with very heavy rainfall.  Rainfall rates of 4 to 5 inches per hour were common under the heavier cells.  Several locations received 2 to 5 inch rainfalls in under  two hours, resulting in widespread flash flooding.  Reports of major highways being inundated by water were common.  By the end of the night, a swath of 4 to 9 inch rainfall was evident north of Interstate 80.  Longer term river flooding became a major problem by the morning of the 23rd.  There were two lightning related injuries.  Two people were injured when they were struck by lightning out of doors in Nevada.  The lightning struck close by as they were carrying groceries into their home.  The jolt caused them to fall, resulting in laceration to the head.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This warm front began the day nearly stationary, taking 8 hours to move from Vincennes to Bloomington, then rocketing northward as the low pressure system quickly pushed off to the northeast late, dragging a cold front through the state during the overnight hours. All the necessary ingredients for a major severe weather outbreak were falling into place.  Morning upper-air observations showed very deep moisture and intense wind shear (wind change in speed and direction with respect to height) in the lower levels of the atmosphere.  Fairly clear skies during the course of the day contributed to moderately strong instability across much of Indiana.  Along and north of the warm front, winds backed to the east-southeast, further enhancing the wind shear.  This area of enhanced shear with the deep moisture and instability pooled along it would serve as the focus for the first two rounds of severe weather in the Indianapolis County Warning Area (CWA) on May 30th.The first wave of severe weather came in the early afternoon, as individual rotating thunderstorms, or supercells, formed just south of the warm front, crossing over the boundary soon after forming and moving into the area of enhanced shear.  These supercells began to show strong rotation soon after their formation, and produced several funnel reports and confirmed tornadoes near Spencer and Ellettsville.  Each of these tornadoes were rated F1 on the Fujita Scale of Tornado Intensity, a rating corresponding to the partial peeling of roofs and destruction of small outbuildings.Wave number two began in the late afternoon and continued into the early evening hours. Additional supercell development occurred further west along the warm front, in an area that had been receiving plenty of heating all day, maximizing instability in the very moist air mass. This wave of storms included a storm that produced tornadoes in Fountain and Tippecanoe counties, one of which was rated F2 near Dayton, just southeast of Lafayette, and a long-lived supercell that tracked along and just south of the I-70 corridor, producing tornadoes in Brazil, Little Point, Monrovia, just south of Plainfield, Camby, and Indianapolis.  Power flashes from the Camby tornado were visible from the front door of NWS Indianapolis.  The strongest of these tornadoes was the Indianapolis tornado, which briefly achieved F2 strength on the southeast side near Keystone Avenue between Raymond and Troy where there was significant damage to numerous homes, a nursing home and an elementary school. 26 nursing home inhabitants were treated at local hospitals for minor injuries, and the rest were relocated as the building was inhabitable. In addition to this tornado, the Monrovia tornado was rated F1.  All additional tornadoes from this particular supercell were rated F0, a rating corresponding to moderate tree damage and damage to outbuildings and signboards. There was also a lightning fatality in Veedersburg in Fountain County as a 24 year old male was struck while on a baseball field.The final wave of severe weather came in the late evening and early nighttime hours, and was mostly in the form of wind damage, although brief tornadoes did occur along the squall line that had formed near the Mississippi River and tracked eastward, accompanying the passage of the cold front, including tornadoes near Lake Monroe and Crothersville in south central Indiana, and Atlanta and Frankton in north central Indiana.  The tornado near Lake Monroe was rated F1, while all additional tornadoes were rated F0.To complicate the issue, the repeated rounds of heavy rain caused flooding problems across much of the area, with several flash flood warnings and urban/small stream flood advisories being issued during the evening and overnight hours.Fifteen total tornadoes touched down in central Indiana on May 30th, with damage estimates approaching $13,000,000 for central Indiana alone. In all, an additional eight tornadoes touched down in portions of Indiana that are served by neighboring NWS forecast offices, bringing the statewide total for the day to 23, four over the yearly average of 19.  This places the May 30th outbreak as the second largest outbreak in state history, behind the outbreak of 2 June 1990, and ahead of the "Super Outbreak" of 3-4 April 1974.  37 tornadoes touched down statewide in the 1990 outbreak, and 21 tornadoes touched down during the Super Outbreak, which was the largest outbreak of tornadoes in recorded history, with 148 tornadoes touching down across 13 states and southern Canada, killing 351 and injuring thousands.  Nationwide, several more tornadoes were reported, along with nearly 200 reports of large hail and nearly 600 reports of wind damage.  Reports occurred all along the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, stretching from central Minnesota all the way to northeast Texas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 24 year old male was hit by lightning on a baseball field and died shortly thereafter.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Although individual storms were moving toward the northeast, the line appeared to be moving to the southeast.  The downburst winds were all discharged toward the southwest, as all damage around Crystal City area was blown in that direction.  Damage was severe in Crystal City.  Leaves had been shredded from trees and plastered onto the sides of the cars and houses, and streets were covered with the shredded leaves.  Homes had damage to their outside walls, roofs, and windows.  What was shocking was to see the piles of semi-melted hail still as high as 2 feet in some of the drifts created by the flooding.  In spite of the fact that the hail had been melting for over 24 hours when the survey was made, it was still piled in spotty waves across the city from east to west and north to south.  Hail was reported to have been as large as 1.5 to 2 inches in diameter, with a couple of reports of hail to 3 inches.  The high winds, combined with hail and rain, caused widespread damage to homes, destroying two mobile homes and the roofs of two houses.  Several dozen homes in Crystal City sustained some type of damage.  Some of the worst damage occurred at the library and the H.E.B. grocery store.  The metal roof was blown off the library and deposited on the southwest side of the building.  The roof of the H.E.B. grocery store collapsed.  It appeared to be beneath the area where the air conditioners were positioned on the west side of the store.  This is also where the rain and ice would have accumulated the thickest and would possibly have clogged drainage holes.  One injury was reported in the storms.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The hail was driven at times by wind gusts around 60 mph.  Most buildings and vehicles in the community suffered some sort of damage.  Holes were punched in roofs and siding; cars were dented, and windows broken.  Buildings that had siding damage were damaged almost exclusively on their south side.  The storm spawned hundreds of insurance claims.  A local church had to patch 300 holes in its roof.  Damage to a school roof was estimated at nearly $200,000, and a local greenhouse lost over a thousand two-foot by two-foot window panes.  One individual suffered a badly bruised back as he tried to move his vehicle to shelter.  Substantial damage was done to crops (largely potatoes, with some beans, tomatoes and corn in the mix) in nearby fields.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
