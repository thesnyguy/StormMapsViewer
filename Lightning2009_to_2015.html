A strong push of warm air took place ahead of the low with 850 mb winds around 40 kts pushing into the central U.S.  Surface dew points rose to the mid 50s just south of Iowa during the afternoon with the 50 degree dew points reaching just north of the southern Iowa border.  At the same time, a strong polar high pressure area was poised over northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  Sub-zero temperatures reached as far south as the northern South Dakota border during the afternoon.  The atmosphere was marginally unstable with most unstable, elevated, CAPE values in the 500 to 1000 J/kg range in the afternoon.  Shear increased to between 30 and 45 kts with precipitable water values in the three quarters to one inch range over the southeast half of the state.  Thunderstorms in some form occurred through the day.  Over northern Iowa, they produced ice pellets and some small hail.  One half of an inch of ice pellet accumulation occurred in Emmet and Cerro Gordo Counties, with nearly an inch of ice pellet accumulation in Worth County.  These accumulations were the result of thunderstorms.  Thunderstorms were more intense over southeast Iowa.  The freezing level was relatively low, at 8200 feet, resulting in most of the storms producing hail of at least pea size.  Available CAPE was around 200 J/kg at the time.  Penny to quarter size hail fell in central Iowa, across the Des Moines metro area.  Lightning struck an overpass along Interstate 80/35 along the north side of the Des Moines metro area and knocked a chunk of concrete off of it.  The concrete fell onto the windshield of a moving van, smashing through the glass.  The driver was injured and admitted to the hospital with minor injuries.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An unseasonably warm and unstable air mass developed in advance of the cold front during the late afternoon and early evening across north and central Georgia as warm, moist air rode northward into Georgia on a strong low-level jet.  Afternoon temperatures in the 70s and dewpoints in the 60s, combined with strong shear and moderate instability, resulted in the development of numerous supercell thunderstorms from mid-afternoon until a few hours after midnight on the 19th.  Ten tornadoes, ranging in scale from EF0 to EF3 tracked across several north and central Georgia counties.  The worst tornadoes affected the east central Georgia counties of Jasper, Putnam, Hancock, and Jasper.  A death was observed in Hancock county with an EF3 tornado and several injuries were reported from Putnam and Hancock counties.  In addition to the tornadoes, very large hail occurred with several of the thunderstorms, including four-inch diameter hail in Coweta and Fayette counties just south of Atlanta.  Numerous reports of golf ball and larger-sized hail were received.  The event resulted in millions of dollars of damage and the destruction of several homes in north and central Georgia counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Spalding County Emergency Management Director reported that a person was struck and injured by lightning.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A cold front was approaching the area from the northwest.  The front, combined with disturbances in the northwest flow aloft, brought another round of showers and thunderstorms to the area during the maximum heating hours of afternoon and evening. While the thunderstorms remained below severe limits, frequent cloud-to-ground lightning and heavy rain were common in north Georgia.  Some lightning fires were reported, a few trees were blown down, and flash flooding was observed in parts of metropolitan Atlanta.  During the early morning hours of the 13th, a mesoscale convective complex moved southeast out of Tennessee into north central and west central Georgia.  While these thunderstorms were not severe, frequent cloud-to-ground lightning was observed once again, affecting one home shortly after midnight in Floyd county and another in Fayette county around 530 am EDT.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Gwinnett Daily Post reported that a woman, at her residence on the Gwinnett county side of Loganville, was injured by a nearby lightning strike.

The hail, ranging from golfball to baseball size, hit northeast Denver, Brighton and Commerce City the hardest.  The storms then continued to spread to the north and east; impacting Hudson, Prospect Valley, Byers and Deer Trail.   The strong thunderstorm wind and hail stripped bark and branches from trees.  Numerous accidents were reported as the hail accumulated up to a foot in depth on roadways.  Homes and vehicles in the area were pummeled by hail.   The Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Associated estimated to damage to be around $70 million; based off approximately 13,600 automobile and homeowner claims.  A child in Commerce City was struck in the leg by lightning while watching televison.  A bison and the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge was struck and killed by blast of lightning.  Two tornadoes also touched down in open country; one near Denver International Airport and the other near Keenesburg.  ||The heavy rain and hail caused flash flooding to occur around the towns of Hudson and Keenseburg; forcing the closure of State Highway 52.  Extensive crop damage was reported across southern Weld County.  Approximately 1500 acres of sugar beets were damaged in the Prospect Valley and Windsor areas.  About 360 acres of sweet corn, cabbage and onions in the Hudson area were inundated with heavy rain and a torrent of hail.  In Windsor, a barn was demolished by intense thunderstorm winds.   The wind ripped the 40-ft by 40-ft structure of a garage and exterior corrugated roof and walls about 75 yards from its original foundation. Also, two cow shelters and 150 calf shelters were blown over.  Near Bellvue, several structures were knocked down and a 15-ft silo was blown across a field by damaging thunderstorm winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A child was struck in the leg by lightning while watching television.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The airmass became unstable in front of it with a considerable push of deep moisture.  Precipitable water values increased to 2 to 2.4 inches by afternoon.  CAPE increased to 2500 to 4000 J/kg as afternoon temperatures climbed into the mid to upper 80s, with dewpoint readings in the low to middle 70s.  The lifted index fell to -5 to -7 C.  The atmosphere was not strongly sheared with 25 to 35 kts of effective shear available.  CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 600 and 800 J/kg.  Downdraft CAPE was in the 1000-1400 J/kg range.  A squall line developed ahead of the cold front and became marginally severe.  Many of the storms produced small hail and gusty winds.  A few locations reported winds in excess of 60 MPH, with the the highest winds reported of 64 MPH in Carroll County in Templeton.  High winds from thunderstorms moving into Winnebago County downed trees in a city park in Buffalo Center.  Winds estimated near 80 MPH snapped the top off of a power pole in Buffalo Center and also caused considerable tree damage and out building damage in the area.  Heavy rainfall was an issue with the storms given the high precipitable water values.  Three inches of rain fell in 50 minutes southeast of Madrid in Boone County, with reports of around 4 inches for storm total in the Ames area.  In Emmet County, 2.65 inches of rain fell in a little over an hour in Ringsted.  Fortunately, it has been quite dry for the previous 10 days.  The rains did not cause flash flooding, but did result in some urban flooding.  A 15 year old girl was struck by lightning in Leon as the thunderstorms passed.  She was walking across a parking lot and lightning struck just as she reached for the door handle of her car.  She was taken to hospital and remained overnight, however there were no detectable injuries beyond memory loss of the event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 15 year old girl was struck by lightning.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Unseasonably high temperatures in the upper 70s to lower 80s and dew points in the upper 60s to near 70 produced an unstable environment.   Deep layer shear was sufficient for supercell thunderstorms, while low level shear was quite strong as well.  As a result, numerous supercell thunderstorms, many of them low topped, erupted in multiple bands across northern Alabama as early as late morning and lasted into the early evening hours.   The storms brought the potential for severe weather for around eight hours.  Many of the storms contained meso-cyclones, but only four produced brief weak tornadoes.   Others produced wind damage associated with the rear flank downdrafts of the storms or with bowing segments.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A woman was struck by lightning.

Many counties across the area were impacted by golf ball and larger hail.  There was one report of hail over four inches in diameter in west central Georgia near Newnan.  While hail was the predominate severe weather type with this outbreak, there were several reports of damaging winds and even one tornado in central Georgia.  In addition, there were several lightning incidents as many of the storms produced intense cloud-to-ground lightning.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The Douglas County Emergency Management Director reported that a middle-aged male was shocked indirectly by a nearby lightning strike while on a riding lawn mower just outside Douglasville.  Although fire and emergency medical personnel were dispatched to the scene, no medical treatment was provided.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

For the first time in approximately three weeks, isolated thunderstorms developed over the Sierra crest around Kings Canyon and points just to the north and east. The surge of monsoonal moisture continued through the end of the month, with the strongest thunderstorm activity on July 30th and the morning of the 31st. A few thunderstorms over the Southern Sierra Nevada had rain rates of an inch or more in an hour, and a severe thunderstorm moved over Edwards Air Force Base during the afternoon of the 30th. The warm nature of the monsoonal moisture kept central and southern San Joaquin Valley high temperatures around 100 degrees through July 30th. ||A line of thunderstorms moved through the central and southern San Joaquin Valley during the morning of July 31st, bringing record-tying rain to both Bakersfield and Fresno. After the thunderstorms moved out of the San Joaquin Valley, skies began to clear and temperatures warmed rapidly. With the cloud cover, the temperature at Fresno was between 70-72 degrees for most of the morning of the 31st. But once the clouds began to clear, the temperature warmed at a rate of 8 degrees per hour from 11 AM to 1 PM (reaching 88 degrees), and topped out at 97 degrees at 5 PM.|Both Bakersfield and Fresno were 0.6 degrees warmer than normal for July. However, July was the last month to use the 1971-2000 30-year climatological normals. The new normals, for 1981-2010, were implemented of August 1st. The new average temperature for July is slightly warmer than the 1971-2000 average. Using the new normals, July 2011 was slightly cooler than normal, with Bakersfield down 0.1 degree, and Fresno down 1.0 degree. Both Bakersfield and Fresno had 11 days with highs of 100 or above in July.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 21- Year old woman was struck in the ankle while inside her home by lightning.

However, an upper level low moved from the Great Basin into central California on the 9th. This atypical movement of the low occurred because it was cut off from the prevailing westerly winds aloft. These systems usually move into the area from the Pacific Ocean. This low changed the flow aloft over the region to southeasterly, drawing moisture into central California from Arizona and northwestern Mexico. This warm, unstable airmass brought showers and thunderstorms to much of interior central California from the 9th through the 14th. Isolated thunderstorms continued over the Sierra Nevada crest on the 15th, as residual moisture remained over the area while the southeasterly flow transitioned to a more southwesterly direction. ||The low meandered across central and southern California during these several days. This low allowed for unstable conditions over the entire district; quite a few locations in the San Joaquin Valley received at least a trace of rain. On the 9th, thunderstorms produced little rainfall, but they did cause quite a few wildfires due to lightning over the mountains in Kern County (around Keene, Breckenridge, and just to the east of Arvin and Bakersfield). As for the 10th, numerous thunderstorms developed over Kern County and much of the southern San Joaquin Valley during the evening. In addition, more wildfires developed over the Kern County mountains A severe thunderstorm warning and numerous significant weather advisories were issued throughout Kern County that evening; these storms moved westward into San Luis Obispo County later that night. Afternoon showers and thunderstorms redeveloped mainly over the Tehachapi Mountains and the Southern Sierra Nevada daily on the 11th, 12th, and 13th, and a few showers occurred over the south end of the San Joaquin Valley, including Bakersfield, on the 13th. Thunderstorms that developed over the Piutes during the afternoon of September 11th were nearly stationary, and runoff from these storms caused road flooding in the area south of Lake Isabella. ||The South Lightning Tennessee Fire occurred in Tulare county 5 miles north of Fountain Springs. Reports indicated that the fire began on 9/11/11 at 1200 PDT due to heavy lightning strikes from thunderstorms. ||The Tamarack wildfire occurred just northeast of Yosemite Valley in Mariposa County on 9/13/11 at 1912 PDT. This wildfire was caused by extensive lightning. The size was 480 acres. The fire was contained on 10/6/11. There were no lost fatalities or structures.

The bolt passed through his entire body.  His hair was singed.  His tennis shoes had holes in them.  He fell to his back and was stiff as a board.  He was not breathing and did not have a pulse.  Fellow teammates performed CPR for about 10 to 15 minutes until EMS arrived.  He was taken to a local hospital, then transported to a Morgantown hospital.  Eventually, he was sent to a burn center in Pittsburgh.  A week later he was recovering.  He was to be moved to a rehabilitation center which was closer to home.||Two other players were knocked to the ground during the strike, but were not injured.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This allowed for an unstable air mass to be in place across the region.  As an upper level shortwave moved from the Ohio Valley towards the Northeast, scattered thunderstorms developed during the afternoon and evening hours.

He went to cardiac arrest, and later died.||In addition, the very moist air mass allowed these thunderstorms to produce very heavy rainfall in a short period of time.  This led to flash flooding in a few locations, including portions of the Mohawk Valley that were still cleaning up from flash flooding earlier in the month and in late June. ||Thunderstorm activity diminished by the evening hours due to the loss of daytime heating, ending the threat for additional severe storms or flash flooding.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 26 year old man was struck by lightning on a beach at Lake Taghkanic State Park in Gallatin.

The complex gradually weakened as it tracked into the northern Wabash Valley during the evening, producing gusty winds to the northwest of Indianapolis before it diminished. This would be the start of an active period for central Indiana, with rain and thunderstorms impacting portions of the area for the rest of the month. The region remained on the fringe of a strong ridge aloft centered over the central Plains with scattered thunderstorms developing as upper level waves tracked along the periphery of the ridge and across the Ohio Valley. The development of an upper low across the region by the end of the month continued the daily threat for rain and thunderstorms. Isolated to scattered severe thunderstorms impacted central Indiana each afternoon and evening from the 22nd through the 27th. Some of the storms moved across the same areas on the 25th and 26th, producing 2 day rainfall totals over 7 inches.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> WISH-TV reported that an Indianapolis Zoo guard was indirectly hit by lightning Sunday afternoon when a line of storms moved through the area. Around 3:35 p.m., a security guard standing near the administration building was hit by an indirect lightning strike, meaning the charge of the lightning strike made contact, not the bolt.

Behind the cold front, gusty winds developed over the mountains and deserts on the 19th. The winds began during the early morning hours, with a gust to 60 mph at Bear Peak in Tulare County, and a gust to 53 mph at Mojave, during the pre-dawn hours. Winds gusted over 45 mph in the eastern Kern County desert during the morning and early afternoon of the 19th, and gusts to 50 mph were recorded in the Piutes.||An upper-level ridge of high pressure returned to California on the 19th behind the departing low-pressure system. High temperatures warmed to above normal for the next several days before the next storm arrived during the afternoon of February 26th. This warming trend peaked with Bakersfield hitting 81 degrees on the 25th, and Fresno reaching 80 degrees. This was the first time either city had seen 80 degrees since November 10th, 2013.||The storm that reached the central California interior on February 26th was the first of two closely-spaced systems. Together, the two storms brought as much as 4 inches of rain to the Southern Sierra Nevada foothills, and over an inch of rain to the Kern County deserts. Fresno had a three-day storm total of 1.11 inch, bringing the total rainfall for February to 2.11 inch. This was 0.08 inch greater than the normal of 2.03 inches and was the first time since December 2012 that Fresno had above-normal rainfall for a month.||The south end of the San Joaquin Valley was rain-shadowed, with Bakersfield receiving only 0.28 inch of rain, almost all of which fell from the second storm on February 28th. The second storm was located off the central California coast, and was impressive on satellite pictures with a tightly-wound structure and a clear center much like the eye of a tropical system. The circulation around the storm produced a southerly wind over the Tehachapi Mountains which funneled through Tejon Pass and down the Grapevine into the south end of the San Joaquin Valley. Winds gusted as high as 89 mph at Grapevine Peak, and to 50 mph at Sunflower Valley on the west side of the Valley. At Buck Rock, in the Sierra Nevada in Tulare County, winds gusted to 66 mph.|Several thunderstorms were spawned by the storms, with the second system being the most potent. Numerous trees were toppled in both the San Joaquin Valley and the Sierra foothills by winds, in many cases pulling down power lines. One thunderstorm at Squaw Valley in the foothills produced a gust estimated at 65 mph, which toppled trees and damaged the roof of a garage. On the Valley floor, there were reports of houses and parked vehicles damaged by falling trees or large limbs. Near Fresno, a tree 3 feet in diameter was toppled.||Street flooding was reported at several locations, not only in the San Joaquin Valley but also in eastern Kern County where the Garlock Road flooded. (Garlock Road is prone to flooding from runoff from the El Paso Mountains.). In Dinuba, water covering the road was estimated at 8 to 12 inches deep. ||In the Southern Sierra Nevada, estimates of new snowfalls were as high as four feet. (These were Snotel observations; a post-storm snow survey had not been conducted at the time of this summary.)||February 2014 was much warmer than normal, and was Fresno���s warmest February on record. Bakersfield tied for its 6th warmest February on record.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Lightning caused an injury to a man who was in an oil field near Fresno.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An arch of thunderstorms moved northeast out of Tennessee during the late afternoon, through eastern Kentucky and into West Virginia near sunset.

For example, the Tri State Airport near Huntington had a gust to 51 mph at 1909E, a spotter near Leon had a 45 mph gust around 1955E, and Charleston had a 46 mph gust near 2030E.  A few spots received slightly stronger wind gusts.  Electrical power outages occurred.  Cabell County and the Huntington vicinity had about 16,000 customers without electricity.       ||After an overnight and morning lull, more rounds of convection developed during midday on the 11th in southwest Virginia and southern West Virginia.  Those showers and thunderstorms moved northeast through portions of West Virginia during the afternoon.||Additional clusters of showers and thunderstorms moved northeast through West Virginia during the overnight hours of the 11th into the 12th.

Precipitable water increased to around 1.75 inches.  The freezing level was quite high at around 15,000 feet.  Fairly strong shear was present with 40 to 50 kts of effective shear by late afternoon.  A line of thunderstorms formed ahead of the cold front by late afternoon and moved east across the state through the evening hours.  Hail with the storms was generally quite small.  One inch diameter hail fell in Crawford County in Dow City.  The primary severe events from this system were high winds that occurred as the MCS progressed across the state.  Several locations reported gusts of 60 MPH or higher.  An 80 MPH gust was reported in Guthrie County at Yale and Bayard.  A 71 MPH wind gust occurred in Marion County.  Heavy rainfall was also of significance with flash flooding in Crawford County.  This was caused by a dam failure which flooded Highway 39.  Three inches of rain fell in 50 minutes in Dallas County.  There were numerous reports of around 2 inches of rain falling in Boone and Polk Counties.  Water ponding and low-land flooding was common.  One person was struck by lightning at the Denison Airport.  The person received minor injuries. Funnel clouds were sighted in both Crawford and Boone Counties.

Thunderstorms developed over Iowa during the early afternoon and organized into a forward-propagating quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) and tracked to southern Lake Michigan by early to mid evening. Meanwhile, a second complex of intense thunderstorms developed over central and eastern Iowa and also evolved into a QLCS, tracking across northern Illinois and northwest Indiana late in the evening into the overnight hours. ||Across northern Illinois and northwest Indiana, the first derecho event produced scattered straight-line wind damage, with gusts measured as high as 70 MPH.  The second derecho produced far more extensive damage, with 80 to 90 MPH straight line winds and numerous tornadoes.  Initial post-event surveys cataloged 18 tornadoes across northern Illinois and northwest Indiana, 17 of EF1 intensity and one of EF0 intensity.  Of these 18 tornadoes, 14 were associated with a pair of large mesovortices that traveled along the Kankakee River Valley in Kankakee County, Illinois and Lake, Newton, and Jasper Counties in Indiana.  ||Analysis of Google Earth satellite imagery gathered in spring of 2015 showed numerous additional areas of damage not documented in the original survey efforts.  A thorough analysis of this imagery and synthesis with the original survey information led to a complete reanalysis of the Kankakee Valley tornadoes.  Ultimately, 18 tornado tracks were identified alone in the Kankakee Valley, leading to a total of 22 tornadoes for northern Illinois and northwest Indiana. Of the 18 revised tornadoes, 16 of the paths were determined, in part, using satellite imagery. Further re-examination of the damage also led to a change in rating for several of the damage locations. Of the 18 reanalyzed Kankakee Valley tracks, two were rated EF2, 13 were rated EF1, and three were rated EF0. Additional details on this reanalysis, including the methods used, can be found in the Electronic Journal of Severe Storms Meteorology (Lyza et al. 2019, ���A Multi-Platform Reanalysis of the Kankakee Valley Tornado Cluster on 30 June 2014���).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A home on the 15700 block of Peggy Lane was struck by lightning sparking a fire.
