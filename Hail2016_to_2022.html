The strongest wind gusts occurred in Gem where a tree was split in half.  The most unusual effects of the severe winds included round bales of hay being blown up and over Highway 25 south of Colby and glass from broken windows being embedded in the gym floor in Brewster.

Many vehicles had dents and broken windows from the hail.  Two adults and a child were treated at Goodland Regional Hospital for injuries to the face, head, and arms.

Isolated, high-based supercell thunderstorms erupted first near the U.S. Highway 83 corridor from Childress south to Aspermont, with even more intense supercells occurring later over the western South Plains. Some of these storms produced giant hail of 3 to 4 inches in diameter causing severe damage to crops, buildings and vehicles. Cities hit especially hard included Childress, Amherst, Littlefield, and Anton where combined property damages may exceed $10 million with regional agricultural losses approaching $50 million.  Toward midnight CST, individual storms grew more linear over the southern South Plains before exiting southeast of the region before daybreak on July 1st.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This is the continuation path of the devastating supercell that moved slowly southeast along U.S. Highway 84 from Lamb County. Wind-driven hail as large as baseballs shattered home windows, destroyed siding, punctured roofs, heavily damaged vehicles, wiped out crops, and stripped trees across far northeast Hockley County.  The mayor of Anton described the hail damage as the worst he had ever seen in decades of living on the Texas South Plains and declared a state of disaster. The American Red Cross said 100% of the roughly 400 homes in Anton sustained serious damage, with each home requiring on average $6,000 of repairs.  One resident of Anton was bruised by the large hail and cut by broken glass as he attempted to cover up shattered windows during the storm.  About 8,000 acres of crops in extreme northeast Hockley County were a total loss from the hail, torrential rainfall and flooding that ensued.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 3.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Typically, thunderstorms across the lower Arizona deserts bring strong gusty winds along with heavy rain, but in this instance the stronger storms produced episodes of large hail. The cooler atmospheric conditions, with lower freezing levels, allowed the large hail to reach the ground. Numerous reports of large hail were received from trained spotters, the public and local broadcast media. The largest hailstones ranged in diameter from 1 inch to nearly 2 inches. In some instances the large hailstones produced damage; according to the public, golf ball sized hail damaged the windows of a car and a home about 2 miles from the town of Coolidge. No injuries were reported due to the large hail.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Thunderstorms with very large hail developed to the southeast of the greater Phoenix area during the afternoon hours on October 21st. Some of the stronger storms produced hail with diameters well in excess of one inch and they affected the areas around the town of Coolidge. According to a report from the public, at 1628MST golf ball sized hailstones fell about 2 miles northeast of Coolidge and they resulted in property damage to a car and house window. At the nearby Lonestar Equestrian Center, the large hail caused minor injuries to some of the horses, and gashed the head of one of the cowboys during a roping contest. The center is located near the intersection of Attaway Road and Coolidge Avenue. The diameter of the largest hailstones was 1.75 inches. At the same time, local broadcast media reported additional large hail about 4 miles northeast of Coolidge. The media relayed a public report indicating that half-dollar sized hail had fallen in Valley Farms; the diameter of the largest hailstones was 1.25 inches.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
