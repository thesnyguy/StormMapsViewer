Despite the occurrence of thirteen tornadoes across the South Plains region, most of the damage resulted from destructive hail and heavy rainfall.  ||Thunderstorms first developed over the northern South Plains around 13:00 CST. These early afternoon storms initiated as supercells, but transitioned into a small-scale convective complex that produced extensive amounts of large hail and heavy rainfall. As the storms trained over the Interstate 27 corridor in Swisher County, a significant hail accumulation and flood event resulted in some 50 vehicles becoming stalled and a prolonged closure of the highway through the overnight hours.||Additional storms developed during the mid to late afternoon hours over the central South Plains. Two supercell thunderstorms impacted Lubbock County. One of these storms produced a destructive hail swath through the city of Lubbock damaging some 3,000 homes and more than 1,100 vehicles totaling an estimated $40 million in damages. Meanwhile a second supercell storm over eastern Lubbock County produced a family of weak tornadoes along U.S. Highway 82 east of Idalou. ||Other supercell storms impacted portions of Garza and Kent Counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. These storms additionally produced damaging hail and brief tornadoes.||By late evening, storm modes transitioned toward broken convective complexes and multicell structures. An unstable low-level environment, however, continued to be characterized by an increasingly enhanced veering of the wind fields. Thus, despite a transition toward less discrete storm cells, the threat for tornadoes remained. Multiple small scale low-level circulations developed within the evolving convective complexes, and these circulations proved to be tornadic. An EF-1 tornado damaged five structures and downed power poles as it tracked nearly eight miles across northwestern Lubbock County and southwestern Hale County around 20:00 CST. Two additional EF-1 tornadoes impacted the Abernathy (Hale County) and Roosevelt (Lubbock County) areas through the 21:00 CST hour. Meanwhile, similar tornadic circulations developed within other storm complexes over portions of Dickens, Kent, and King Counties. Multiple reports of tornadoes were received from rural areas around the Spur, Girard, and Guthrie vicinities but no damages resulted.||In all, an estimated $41.3 million in damages and three injuries resulted from severe weather across the South Plains region of west Texas on the 16th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Giant two and a half inch hail stones fell over the South Haven, Sun Ridge, and Lake Ridge subdivisions of southwest Lubbock between Slide Road and Quaker Avenue around 15:40 CST. The hailstones damaged roofs and skylights on over a 1,000 homes in the mentioned subdivisions, and three persons sought medical treatment at local hospitals for minor injuries related to the hail. Hail stones also reportedly killed a number of birds. Well over 600 vehicles were damaged in these subdivisions and adjacent areas of the city. Damages in the mentioned subdivisions were estimated at $20 million, with hail damage across the city of Lubbock estimated to total $40 million.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Meanwhile, a mid to upper level low near Southern California approached the area from the west.  Although the deepest moisture was confined to the Gulf Coast (due to the previously mentioned surface high) there was enough moisture convergence along a stalled surface boundary and dryline.  Most unstable CAPE values along these features of 1000 j/kg and 0-6 km bulk shear magnitudes of 60 kt allowed for severe storms to develop as the dynamics neared the area during the late afternoon and early evening hours.  A Severe Thunderstorm Watch was issued from 1520-2300 local.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous roofs throughout Midland, TX were damaged during this event.  A local newspaper clipping with a quote from a major roofing company estimated 40 to 50 percent of the homes in Midland needed to be re-roofed.  The average cost to replace a shingled roof is anywhere from $8-$10K.  This resulted in an estimated $160 million in roof damage.  In addition to homes being damaged, multiple vehicles also received damage from the hail.  According to local dent repair shops and car dealers across the area, an estimated 800 vehicles had to be repaired resulting in $1.2 million in damage.  A Midland woman was also struck in the stomach by a hail stone, after it broke through her dining room window.  Her injuries were only minor and did not require medical attention.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 161.20M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The setup for the event featured a slow moving warm front that was draped from far northwest Missouri southeastward into central Missouri. This front had been reinforced by a complex of thunderstorms that had impacted northern Missouri during the overnight and early morning hours prior, allowing abundant low level moisture to become pooled along the front. Strong daytime heating along and south of the front sent temperatures into the middle and upper 80s. With strong instability and moisture in place by late afternoon, conditions were ripe for rapid thunderstorm development as an upper level disturbance moving through Kansas provided the lift necessary for thunderstorms. However, it was the strong turning and increase in winds with height (known as wind shear) that set the stage for severe storms, specifically supercells.||While these extremely photogenic storms thankfully were not damaging tornado producers, June 7th featured some of the most destructive hail ever observed across northern Missouri, with two separate storms producing softball and grapefruit size hail, leaving widespread destruction to trees, homes, and vehicles.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Grapefruit sized hail lasted 10 minutes, on the west shore of Lake Viking.

Surface temperatures on the 8th warmed into the upper 80s and 90s, with dew point readings in the 70s.  A weak cold front moved into the state during the evening of the 8th and early morning of the 9th.  There was little thunderstorm development initially as the airmass was capped.  Temperatures at the 700 mb level were +14 to +17 C.   During the early morning hours of the 9th, a short wave lifted northeast out of the southern Rockies.  This resulted in cooling of the mid levels of the atmosphere, thus destabilizing the airmass.  The cold front stall out during the morning of the 9th as a second short wave lifted northast.   Eventually, the front moved south of the state on the night of the 9th.  Overall lifted indices were in the -6 to -10 C range with CAPE values in the 3000 to 4000 J/kg range.  Downdraft CAPE was in the 800 to 1400 J/kg range with 30 to 50 kts of shear available.  CAOE available in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was between 300 and 700 J/kg, with a freezing level of 14,000 to 14,500 feet.  The LCL was relatively high across the area ranging from just below 1000 meters to about 1250 meters.  Plenty of moisture was available with precipitable water values between 1.75 and 2.25 inches.  Thunderstorms developed initially over Nebraska and tracked east-northeast into Iowa shortly after sunrise.  One supercell continued to track across the state and produced a swath of wind and hail damage from Sac County east to Black Hawk County.  Additional thunderstorms formed along the cold frontal boundary by mid morning and progressed into the state.  The storms remained below severe levels for several hours, but did become severe by mid afternoon.  A broken like of storms formed with two primary areas tracking east across central and southern Iowa.  These two areas featured mini bow echoes.  The predominant mode of severe weather in the afternoon was high winds.  Several of the storms produced hail, but the hail was sub-severe.  A long lived supercell Thunderstorm tracked across northern Iowa Sunday morning with the Highway 20 corridor receiving the brunt of the damage.  Reports of quarter to golf ball sized hail were common with some hail stones reported to be in excess of two inches approaching the size of a tennis ball.  The hail was wind blown as well, at speeds of 50 to 70 mph, making it extremely damaging and dangerous striping siding off houses and knocking out windows.   A measured wind speed of 68 mph was recorded at a KCCI TV SchoolNet site near Jewell in Hamilton County.   Significant hail damage was received all along the track with areas near Otho, Callender, Radcliffe, Eldora and Grundy Center hit particularly hard.  In Eldora, many homes had windows broken out and tree and power line damage left the city without power. Winds of over 100 MPH toppled a communication tower in Eldora.  A short time before the winds hit Eldora, a 102 MPH wind gust was recorded at the landfill northwest of town.  Wind driven hail of 2 to 3 inches in diameter broke all siding and windows out on the north and west walls of most homes, with hail stones reported landing inside of houses.  Damage in the town of Eldora was expected to be greater than the damage done in the town of Parkersburg by the EF5 tornado a year earlier.  A 150 square mile area of crops was affected in Hardin County.  Total losses were reported on 45,000 acres, with 60% or greater loss on another 55,000 acres.  Hail damage in the Otho to Callender areas was described as the worst seen in 20 years.  MODIS satellite pictures of the crop damage area included in this report.  Estimates of crop damage from this one supercell were over $175,000,000.  Governor Culver declared Hardin County a state disaster area within a day or two of the storm, and declared Webster County a disaster area about a week later.  Formal paperwork was turned in to make 8 Iowa counties federal disaster areas,  They were Calhoun, Grundy, Hamilton, Hardin, Ida, Sac, Webster, and Woodbury.  Following the storms, a shelter was set up for those who felt they should not stay in their homes. Luckily the evening round of storms tracked south. Campers at nearby Pine Lake State Park, gathered for an archery event, were bruised by hail.  There were 22 reports of injuries in Hardin County, 11 serious enough for people to be taken to hospital, but there are no known life threatening injuries.  A second round of severe weather rolled roughly along I-80 between 1630 and 1800 CST, producing a lot of tree and power line damage but apparently little structural damage.  As the storms moved through the metropolitan Des Moines area, winds damaged power lines and knocked out power to 12,000 homes.  One storm produced a wet microburst in Union County.  The winds took the roof and shingles off of a two story brick building near Afton.  The afternoon round of storms produced some hail, but most of the hail was not severe as mentioned above, and was pea size or smaller.  During the morning round of storms, lightning struck a building in Waverly.  The lightning struck an antenna on the building and melted screws all the way down the side of the building, starting a small fire and blowing hole in the wall.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Large hail brok windows out of a residence and caused considerable crop damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Stain glassed windows were destroyed at Friends University and hundreds of homes and businesses received roof and window damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The low eventually tracked from southwest Iowa in the afternoon to east central Iowa by early evening.  To the southeast of the front, temperatures warmed into the upper 70s to mid 80s, with dew point temperatures in the upper 50s to mid 60s.  The atmosphere became quite unstable with lifted indices falling to -5 to -8 Celsius and CAPE rising to 2000-3000 J/kg.  The situation was very dynamic with a synoptic scale upper level trough to the west and broad southwest flow over the central U.S.  The jet at 300 mb was around 100 kts with 500 mb winds southwest at 75+ kts.  This aided in producing deep layer shear of 75 to 100 kts over southeast Iowa by late afternoon.  Ample inflow was present with moisture transport at the 850 mb level produced by a 35 to 40 kt flow.  This increased precipitable water values to between 1 and 1.2 inches.  Thunderstorms fired along the frontal boundary during the mid to late afternoon as the front became a cold front.  With 300-400 J/kg of CAPE in the -10 to -30 layer of the atmosphere, and 700-1000 J/kg of downdraft CAPE available, the atmosphere was loaded for the production of wind and hail.  In addition, the freezing level was a relatively low 12,000 feet.  The line of thunderstorms that formed ahead of the advancing cold front became severe quickly, producing large hail.  Much of the hail was in the 1 to 1.5 inch diameter range, however there were several reports of golf ball to tennis ball size hail.  The largest hail was over northeast Iowa with golf ball size reported in Grundy County, and tennis ball size from the northwest edge of Waterloo toward Cedar Falls in Black Hawk County.  Also in Black Hawk County, a few stones were measured to 3.5 inches in diameter in Cedar Falls.  As the system unfolded, the storms began to produce high winds.  Wind gusts of 75 to 100 MPH occurred with the stronger storms.  Multiple homes had siding damage due to hail blown through the siding, and windows were knocked out in Marion County east of Monroe.  High winds snapped power poles in Jasper and Poweshiek Counties.  A camper was blown off of Interstate 80 at mile post 178, resulting in a multiple car accident.  In Poweshiek County, cars were blown off of the road and flipped, power poles snapped, and roofs were taken off of houses near Grinnell.  Power was knocked out to several thousand customers in the Grinnell area.  Six members of the Grinnell College track team were caught in the storm and sustained injuries from the hail.  They were bruised, taken to the hospital, treated and released.  Officials in the city of Grinnell estimated damage due to the high winds from this storm at $10,000,000.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Tornado Watch number 470 was issued early Wednesday morning for far south central North Dakota as intense supercellular thunderstorms with very large hail continued to develop and move east across far southwest and south central parts of the state. The intense thunderstorms eventually transitioned from very large hail producers to damaging wind producers as they moved east of the Missouri River and towards and into the James River Valley region. ||Multiple severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings were issued. Numerous reports of large hail, including a record tying hailstone, and several reports of damaging thunderstorm winds were received during this episode. ||Damage from the very large hail was extensive and extreme. Hardest hit were Hettinger, Grant, Sioux, and Emmons Counties, where baseball to softball size hail fell. Some homes had hailstones crash completely through the roof. The large hail also killed several farm animals, and injured other livestock and pets. A North Dakota record tying hailstone, five inches in diameter, fell at Prairie Knights Resort located in eastern Sioux County. In addition, some areas in these counties experienced more than one wave of large hail. Later Wednesday morning, straight line winds up to 105 mph resulted in extensive damage over portions of Logan and LaMoure Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A North Dakota state record tying hailstone of five inches in diameter fell at Prairie Knights Casino and Resort.

At Denver International Airport alone, large hail up to golfball size, very heavy rain and wind gusts to 59 mph caused substantial damage to 40 planes and stranded approximately 1,500 passengers overnight.  Frontier and United Airlines were hardest hit as dozens of planes were taken out of service for repairs; forcing the cancellation of at least 220 flights over the next several days.  Damage to the aircrafts alone was nearly $5 million.   In addition, 83 cars in airport parking lots were damaged, along with some police cars and maintenance vehicles.  In Watkins, two people suffered minor injuries and 35 to 40 homes were damaged.  As many as 200 residents in a mobile home park were left homeless by the storm, forcing the Red Cross to open a shelter at Bennett High School.  The trailer park contained 52 mobile homes, 14 recreational vehicles, 3 houses and a commercial building.  Hailstones the size of softballs cratered the north sides of the mobile homes.  Some farmers in the area said they lost as much as 85 percent of their total wheat crop.  Power lines were also damaged which affected about 1,200 customers in Watkins.  The strong winds also flipped over a tractor-trailer rig on Interstate 70 near Watkins Road.  Insurance claims for the Watkins, Bennett and Brighton areas was estimated to be $17 million.  The total damage estimate across the entire Urban Corridor, was $164.8 million, and included 17,200 automobile claims and 12,600 homeowner claims.||In addition, thunderstorms producing very heavy rainfall, caused flash flooding in the Four Mile Canyon burn scar west of Boulder.  Three homes reportedly had water up to the windows with water flowing into structures at Fourmile Canyon Road and Gold Run Road.  The heavy rain caused a 4-ft surge along Fourmile Creek through Orodell and into the entry of Boulder Creek.  Several roads were affected which restricted access to the area.  Roads were closed due to water and debris.  Private bridges and drives were washed out and several residents were stranded and later rescued.  Numerous cars were damaged in debris flows and several structures suffered flood damage but were not destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 164.80M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The largest hail fell across the Florence area, where hailstones reached 3 inches in diameter, toward Eppley Airfield where some softball size stones fell.  The hail was accompanied by thunderstorm wind gusts that were measured at 62 mph by Asos at Eppley.  The wind driven hail caused substantial damage to vehicles and houses in eastern and northern Omaha and many cars that were parked in outdoor long-term parking at Eppley had their windows broken out by the first storm then soaked by heavy rain from the second.  Also at Eppley several commercial planes sustained hail damage and a pilot was seriously injured around his eye when a softball-size stone crashed through the passenger gate/ramp leading to a plane at the gate.  Around 270 of 600 decorative globe light along a drive toward the airport were shattered by the hail and wind, resulting in damage of around $500,000.  Hail size was smaller and possibly even absent across the western and southwestern parts of town.   According to State Farm, the largest auto insurer in Nebraska, 1,600 claims were made within a few days of the storm with more likely to follow, with most claims from the Omaha area.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In many areas, the hail lasted for at least 30 minutes. Tens of thousands of cars were damaged by the hail, windows were shattered, roofs were damaged, and trees were shredded of their leaves. The Lakewood area of Dallas was one of the hardest hit areas. Part of the Lakewood Theater was damaged, and thousands of divots damaged the golf course at the Lakewood Country Club.

The second supercell in Dallas County tracked from Irving into Cedar Hill. Another supercell produced an EF-0 tornado, 70-95 mph downburst winds, and softball sized hail in Fannin County. The fourth supercell produced hail up to 3.25 in diameter in Collin County.

In response to this trough, a dryline that was previously stationary in the Rolling Plains began surging west by sunset. Scattered thunderstorms erupted from near Ropesville northeast to the west side of Lubbock in a very short period of time after the cold front collided with the dryline. Intense lifting combined with moderate instability resulted in these storms producing large hail up to golfball size less than 15 minutes after development. One person participating in a youth softball game received a minor injury from the hail.||Strong and severe thunderstorms then quickly expanded along the length of the cold front with several reports of large hail ranging from one to two inches in diameter. This squall line continued east into the Rolling Plains before midnight CST at which point it quickly diminished in intensity. Although some property damage likely resulted from the largest of hailstones this night, no definitive evidence was discovered.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A NWS employee estimated quarter size hail at the Lubbock Youth Sports Complex. Fans and participants at a girl's softball game rushed to dugout shelters after large hail fell very suddenly from a rapidly-developing thunderstorm. Aside from a few raindrops and a stray flash of lightning before the hail began, witnesses said there were no clues that a hailstorm was imminent. This element of surprise contributed to the minor injury of a female teenager participating in the softball game at the time. The youth received a black eye from a falling hailstone.

A squall line developed across southeast Arkansas and moved quickly across north-central Mississippi during the morning, producing multiple reports of damaging winds and ping-pong to golf ball size hail. There were reports of multiple trees blown down, some roofs blown off buildings and wind gusts of 60-80 mph, with a 77 mph wind gust measured at the Columbus AFB surface observing station. A lone supercell moved across southeast Arkansas just after 1:00 pm and showed many indications of very large hail and strong rotation. This storm gradually began making more of a right turn and continued to dive southeast across northeast Louisiana before moving into Mississippi. This storm produced multiple reports of golf ball to baseball size hail as it continued to dive southeast, shattering windows in homes and vehicles. This storm gradually weakened as another storm began to develop just to the southwest over Morehouse Parish. The storm continued to move southeast with the southern edge of the storm beginning to develop supercell characteristics. This storm became the focus of activity as it began rapidly increasing in intensity and showing signs of producing large hail. Ping pong to tennis ball size hail fell as the storm moved into northern Warren County, breaking numerous windows on vehicles near Redwood. Strong winds blew a tree on a house and caused a minor injury near Redwood. The long-lived supercell continued to move into a favorable environment and produced multiple reports of golf ball to baseball size hail along its path as it moved into the Jackson metro area. The largest hailstone was softball size, or 4.25 inches, which fell in Clinton around 3:50 pm, shattering vehicle windshields. One injury occurred in the Pinehaven community near Clinton when a baseball size hailstone fell onto a resident causing head trauma. This supercell continued to move southeast over the downtown Jackson metro area with numerous reports of golf ball to baseball size hail falling all along the path. The large hail from this supercell caused major roof damage, shattered windshields and caused dents in numerous vehicles and siding damage to multiple mobile homes in the Jackson metro area. The squall line in northeastern Mississippi produced an outflow boundary that moved to the south and southeast which would serve as a focus for additional thunderstorm development ahead of the storm moving into western Mississippi. Thunderstorms began increasing in intensity along the outflow boundary and numerous reports of large hail continued in a swath down into southern Mississippi. Reports of golf ball to baseball size hail were received along a line from Seminary to Natchez and a few golf ball size hailstones fell south of Columbia. As the actual cold front finally made its way through the I-20 corridor and south, additional hail fell during the evening. However, this hail was significantly smaller than what fell earlier, with sizes ranging from nickel to quarter size. The thunderstorms gradually moved out of the Pine Belt region late on the evening of the 18th.||An elementary school in Clinton was damaged bad enough to have to close for the remainder of the school year, and many state and local law enforcement vehicles were heavily damaged or totaled. The amount of damages to the Jackson metro area were staggering and will be remembered for years to come. The hailstone that fell in Clinton was the 3rd largest hailstone in March in Mississippi since 1950, only surpassed by a grapefruit size hailstone that fell on March 30th, 1993 in Puckett, MS and on March 6th, 1996 in Laurel, MS. It was also the 7th largest hailstone to fall in Mississippi for any month, with the largest hailstone of 5.0 inches, or CD/DVD size, falling in Lafayette County on April 10th, 1962.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This long lived storm that continued out of Warren County produced golf ball to grapefruit size hail along its path as it moved toward the Jackson metro area. The largest hailstone (4.25 inches in diameter) fell in Clinton around 3:50 pm, shattering vehicle windshields. One injury occurred in the Pinehaven community near Clinton when a baseball size hailstone fell onto a resident causing head trauma. This storm continued to move southeast over the downtown Jackson metro area with numerous reports of golfball to baseball size hail falling all along the path. The large hail from this supercell caused incredible roof damage all across the city, as well as shattering thousands of vehicle windows and windshields, as well as denting thousands of vehicles. Substantial siding damage occurred to multiple mobile homes as well. Large hail fell at Hawkins Field, causing incredible damage to aircraft that were parked on the ramp.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
