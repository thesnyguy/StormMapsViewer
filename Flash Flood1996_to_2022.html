In addition to these tornadoes, a major flood developed over Harris and surrounding counties during the middle of this tornadic outbreak. Over 300 homes, along with hundreds of vehicles, were flooded.These tornadic storms developed over parts of Wharton and Matagorda counties shortly after sunrise with the first confirmed tornado occurring just east of El Campo around 9:00 am. Strong 500mb upper level troughing over the western U.S. moved from west to east across the Southern Plains. The polar jet stream associated with this 500 millibar trough surged into west Texas and then curved sharply northeastward into the Central Plains. The sub-tropical jet stream was oriented west to east across deep southern Texas. This jet stream pattern was the impetus to strong lower level convergence due to the enhanced upper level divergence. Low level moisture had substantially increased and was about 200 percent of normal by 6 AM. Vertical wind profiles also showed a great deal of low level wind shear with the greatest shear occurring in the lowest 2000 feet. In addition, these veering wind speeds rapidly increased with height. A focus for the thunderstorm development was provided by a weak low level boundary which was aligned southwest to northeast, or generally along the U.S. Highway 59 corridor. This feature was nearly-stationary and thunderstorms repeatedly developed and moved along this boundary. The axis of heaviest rain was coincident with this boundary.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Extensive flooding in and around the Sharpstown area. One 17 year old female fatality with one 18 year old male injury when van they were driving became flooded outside of high school.

The extremely heavy rain resulted in widespread flooding across Mitchell county.  Before the flooding began, the complex of thunderstorms had a history of producing winds in excess of 60 mph and hail to the size of golf balls.  The largest hail was reported near Damar and Stockton in Rooks county, and around Webber in Jewell county.  Winds of 60 to 80 mph were also reported and caused damage from Smith Center to Glen Elder.  In Smith Center, a roof was torn from a church by the high wind while windows were blown out of a downtown business.  Large tree limbs were reported down in the Glen Elder area.  Electricity was lost to several locations throughout the night.By late evening, radar estimates and reports from around Mitchell county began to paint a picture of torrential rainfall and widespread flooding across the county.  About 8 inches of rain was reported in Beloit, with 8 to 12 inches measured south and east of town.  Water was over Highway 14 south of Beloit.  The road was blocked off for a time.  There were reports of numerous bridges and roads under water or washed out from west of Beloit to the east end of the county along and near the Solomon River.  At the Indian Creek Bridge about 2 miles west of Beloit, a farmer narrowly escaped death as his tractor collapsed the bridge and he was washed into the creek and eventually into the Solomon River.  After being washed downstream by the raging current, the farmer grabbed a hold of some tree branches along the river and pulled himself to safety from the water.  He suffered minor injuries from the ordeal.The Solomon River was out of its banks from west of Beloit downstream to Simpson.  The river crested around 25 feet at Beloit or about 5 feet above flood stage.  The flow recorded by the USGS at Simpson on the eastern Mitchell county line was greater than the flow recorded in 1993.  Throughout Mitchell county, economic losses due to soil erosion, crop flooding and structural damage to farmstead buildings totaled from 1 to 3 million dollars.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A total of 5.47 inches of rain was recorded in Wanamingo in 24 hours, 2.8 inches of which fell between 9:30 and 10:30 PM.  An unnamed creek which flows into the North Fork Zumbro River rose 20 feet above its normal 1 foot level and rushed over Highway 1 about 1 mile south of the Highway 30 intersection in Wanamingo Township, about 4 miles west of Wanamingo. By 10:30 PM the creek completed covered the road in rushing water up to 2.5 feet deep and shortly thereafter two separate vehicles were swept off the roadway and were washed down the creek.  One vehicle, a pickup truck, was found in a nearby ditch with a smashed windshield and badly damaged hood.  The body of the driver, a 47-year-old man, was found three quarters of a mile downstream under farm equipment nearly a day and a half later when the water finally subsided. The man, who lived in Hayfield, was on his way to work in Cannon Falls.  The other vehicle that was washed off the road and into the creek was a sedan. The driver, a 50-year-old Kenyon woman who was on her way home from work, exited the car through an open window after traveling about ½ mile downstream. She floated on her back down the creek until lightning illuminated a nearby fencepost which she grabbed hold of until rescuers arrived two hours later.  Incredibly she survived the ordeal with only bruises. The rushing creek was also responsible for washing out 200 feet of gradual slope along Highway 1 near the road. Scattered debris was also found in farm fields along the creek's banks for several miles.  In addition, an unnamed creek that flows into the North Fork Zumbro River about 2 miles east of Wanamingo inundated the Shades of Sherwood campground around 10:30 PM.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The heaviest rains fell on the northeastern quadrant of the city where extensive flash flooding occurred.  As much as three inches of rain fell between 3 and 4:30 pm as thunderstorms trained over the same small area.  An elderly couple was killed around 4:15 pm after they drove their automobile into a flooded underpass on State Route 611 (Henderson Road) just a couple blocks east of State Route 57 (Broadway).  The underpass filled with more than 12 feet of water in just a few minutes.  Efforts to rescue the couple were unsuccessful.  An automated rain gage just south of the underpass recorded 2.56 inches of rain between 3 and 4 pm and a total of 2.76 inches by 4:30 pm.  A second underpass on State Route 57 (East 28th Street) was flooded by as much as ten feet of water.  Much of Broadway Road was reported to be flowing "like a river" during the peak of the storm.  Severe flooding was reported on most of the major thoroughfares in the northeastern portion of Lorain including Elyria Road, North Ridge Road, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Oberlin Avenue.   Flood waters on Elyria Road were as much as six feet deep with two to three feet of flowing water reported at other locations.  Dozens of vehicles became stranded in the flood waters and rescue efforts were severely hampered by the widespread nature of the flooding.  Industrial areas south and west of the Black River were inundated by flood waters.  Damage to homes and business in the City of Lorain and Sheffield Township from both flash flooding and basement flooding was extensive.   At least 14 families were displaced by flooding.   At least five City of Lorain police cars were destroyed by flooding.  Flooding also was reported along Beaver Creek on the west side of Lorain.  The creek left it's bank and damaged several homes.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.2M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Storm totals averaged from four to six inches with amounts exceeding eight inches toward the Lehigh Valley. The heavy rain caused widespread poor drainage flooding as well as flooding along the smaller creeks in the county. The flooding also resulted in the death of a 19-year-old woman in Milford Township. She lost control of her vehicle while trying to cross a flooded road over the Molasses Creek. Her vehicle hit a guardrail and flipped into the flooded creek. Dozens of roads were impassable with the greatest reported closures in Lower Makefield, Bridgeton and New Hope. The Neshaminy Creek at Langhorne was above its 9 foot flood stage from 1026 p.m. EDT on the 8th through 828 a.m. EDT on the 9th. It crested at 11.74 feet at 445 a.m. EDT on the 9th. Flooding also occurred early that evening at the confluence of the Neshaminy Creek and Delaware River in Bristol and Bensalem Townships at the time of the high tide. Storm totals included 7.52 inches in Sellersville, 6.32 inches in Furlong, 6.01 inches in Doylestown, 5.99 inches in Perkasie, 5.98 inches in Neshaminy Falls and 4.44 inches in Southampton. This heavy rain helped the state of Pennsylvania have its second wettest October on record dating back to 1895. The statewide average precipitation total was 6.49 inches, 3.31 inches wetter than normal. Only 1976 (6.59 inches) was wetter. October 2005 was the wettest October on record at the Philadelphia International Airport with a precipitation total of 8.68 inches, 5.93 inches wetter than normal and surpassed the previous record by 2.02 inches. The cold front moved from near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania at 8 p.m. EDT on the 7th, to the Susquehanna Valley in Pennsylvania at 2 a.m. EDT on the 8th, to the Poconos and Berks County in Pennsylvania and just west of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland at 8 a.m. EDT on the 8th. The cold front stalled as waves of low pressure road northeast along it. At 2 p.m. EDT on the 8th, the cold front just edged into northwestern New Jersey and the Philadelphia northwest suburbs and was still west of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. At 8 p.m. EDT that evening the cold front barely moved into the Philadelphia New Jersey suburbs and the Delmarva Peninsula. The cold front and waves of low pressure cleared the Delaware and New Jersey coasts between Midnight EDT and 2 a.m. EDT on the 9th. The slow movement and stalling coupled with an unstable air mass and tropical moisture associated with Tammy helped enhance the torrential downpours. The flooding would have been even worse if not for the unseasonably dry weather that preceded this event from the middle of August.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Storm total rainfall ranged from between 9 and 11 inches across southwest New Hampshire; and the worst flooding occurred in the Ashuelot River basin, where the community of Alstead lies.  Approximately 1000 people were evacuated in southwest New Hampshire during these floods.The most destructive flooding occurred in Alstead, where there was loss of life, totally destroyed homes and businesses, and numerous bridge washouts.  At approximately 6 AM EST, an estimated 20 to 30 foot flood wave resulted when an embankment failed.  This flood wave traveled down Warren Brook, destroying over one dozen homes, wiping out bridges, and severely damaging many other structures.  This flash flood scoured out numerous, large sections of route 123, and downed utility poles for a five mile stretch.  Downstream, this flooding took out an old double stone-arched bridge in Walpole along the Cold River.In Hinsdale, road washouts were observed with locally severe flood damage near downtown Hinsdale.  A culvert for Kilburn Brook became blocked with tree and rock debris late Saturday night and eventually gave way to wipe out a section of Main Street (Route 119), destroying an abandoned house.Two known fatalities resulted from this significant flood event.  One Alstead man was found dead in a cornfield near the Cold River in Langdon, succumbing to the Warren River culvert breach.  He did not leave his home after being told to evacuate.  A kayaker from Antrim was missing and presumed dead; he was last seen kayaking on the North Branch River in Antrim.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Between 8 and more than 11 inches of rain fell in roughly a five hour period in a five mile wide stripe extending from Madeira Beach northeast through Pinellas Park, then across Old Tampa Bay to west Tampa, including Tampa International Airport. The area of heaviest rain was so concentrated that downtown St. Petersburg, less than 10 miles away, recorded less than an inch of rain during the same period.  The torrential rains caused flash flooding in the areas where more than 8 inches fell. The flash flooding prompted the mayor of St. Petersburg to term the event a "hundred year flood".  In Lealman, an entire mobile home community was evacuated, and at least 60 of the homes were flooded. A partial roof collapse was reported at a big box store in St. Petersburg.  Water pouring into the store washed out several cash register stands and injured one employee as they were washed into the parking lot.  Another roof collapsed at Treasure Island. Hundreds of vehicles were stranded by the flood waters.

With the excessive rainfall, a breach occurred in the Kaloko Reservoir in the northeast section of Kauai.  The water rushed downhill toward Kilauea Bay and cut a 100-yard swath in Kuhio Highway near the town of Kilauea.  The deluge also swept away two homes occupied by seven individuals.

A large fetch of Gulf and Atlantic moisture was pulled northward ahead of the cold front, which produced a squall line of thunderstorms with very heavy rainfall. This line of thunderstorms produced 45 to 74 mph winds across a large part of central NY. Additionally, the squall line spawned an F1 tornado north of Elmira, NY. As the squall line moved east, late in the afternoon of the 16th, it slowed down and stalled for a time. Areas from Owego and Binghamton, NY, north and east through Ithaca, Cortland and Norwich, NY, to Oneida county in the western Mohawk Valley and the northern Catskills saw the brunt of the heavy rainfall from this slow moving line of storms. 1.5 to 4 inches of rain fell in just 3 hours causing significant flash flooding over many of these areas. Many hillsides and creeks turned into raging torrents, causing mudslides and debris flows that cascaded into more populated valley areas. In the urban valley regions, the flash flood reports were numerous with road washouts, highway closings, and some parking lots that were entirely flooded, ruining many cars. A mudslide on Interstate 88 outside of Port Crane, NY caused a multi-car pile up.

The storm initially brought one to two inches of heavy rainfall to parts of western Washington on the 14th, producing areas of urban and small stream flooding and overwhelming drainage systems.  Widespread strong damaging winds followed, impacting the entire state as the storm center tracked from well off the coast east across the region near the British Columbia border. |In western Washington, peak winds reached 80 to 90 mph along the coast and elsewhere 60 to 75 mph.  A few locations had gusts as high 85 mph in the interior. Mountain areas recorded peak wind speeds reached in excess of 100 mph, including 113 mph at Chinook Pass and 100 mph at Sunrise in Mt Rainier National Park.|The wind storm, the strongest since the 1993 Inauguration Day Wind Storm, blew down thousands of trees and knocked power out to close to 1.5 million customers in western Washington.  The strong winds damaged major transmission lines, power poles and other power utility infrastructure. Trees also fell onto houses, street signs, street lights, parked cars, fences, railings and rooftops. |There were four fatalities as a direct result of the storm and eleven indirect fatalities following the storm from carbon monoxide poisoning, encountering downed power lines and a candle started house fire. Three people in western Washington were killed by fallen trees and one person drowned in Seattle when their basement filled with rain runoff. Eight of the indirect fatalities were from carbon monoxide poisoning and another 275 people were treated from the poisoning in King county alone. Two people were electrocuted by downed power lines and one man died after his home burned apparently started by a candle used for light.  36 people were directly injured by the wind storm.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> In the Madison Valley area of Seattle, heavy rainfall produced excessive street runoff, flooding about 25 basements and drowning one woman trapped in her basement by rapidly rising water.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 750.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Water was almost waist-deep at Southcross Boulevard in San Antonio.  Floodwaters were so deep and running so swiftly at the San Antonio High School West Campus that they collapsed a masonry wall and filled the school with almost five feet of muddy water.  Hallways were flooded, and desks, computers and boxes were tossed and thrown together. The students were moved to classrooms in another building across the district. A young man was driving to work in the mid afternoon of August 16 when his vehicle struck a guardrail on Southwest Military Drive and was knocked into Six Mile Creek near South Flores Street.  The young man called his family to say he had had an accident, then exited the vehicle but drowned as he attempted to move to higher ground.  Near midnight a young woman was driving with three friends and a baby near North Star Mall when she accidentally drove her sport utility vehicle into deeper water where it was slammed against a bridge and then was swept into a drainage ditch.  The three other adults in the vehicle were able to get baby out of the vehicle through the window and escape.  But when the three looked back for the driver, she was gone.  Her body was found later by emergency responders when the water receded.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

General rainfall over the southern half of Burnet County was between 10 and 15 inches with the highest rain totals in the Marble Falls area, where up to 19 inches fell. The hardest hit area was Marble Falls, where more than 315 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.  The worst of the damage occurred along Whitman Branch Creek.  This included businesses and even a day care facility.  Personnel from Texas Military Forces were mobilized and sent into Marble Falls to help with rescues and evacuations.  The military personnel, along with swift water rescue and other first responders, completed 32 high water rescues and evacuated hundreds of residents.  Shelters were set up at the Marble Falls Middle School.  At least eight bridges in Burnet County were destroyed with some amount of damage to nearly every road and structure in the southern half of the county.  Most roads remained closed all day, but a few were re-opened in the late afternoon.  Cars and vans were strewn all up and down US281 in the Marble Falls area.  Nearly all parks and lakes were closed.  Businesses in Marble Falls were also closed. Drinking water in Marble Falls was contaminated by the flood and over 1000 residents were without water for at least a week. Total estimates of the damages were placed at $130,000,000.  One swift water rescue team member was forced to save himself when his vehicle was washed off SH71 near Double Horn Creek.  He was able to get to dry land after a prolonged struggle.  A couple in Marble Falls awoke to find their home flooded and with the water rising rapidly.  They scrambled to the highest point in the one-story house as the water continued to rise.  Finally, they had to use a shotgun to blast holes in the ceiling so they could break through to climb up on the roof.  They waited with their two dogs on the roof in the dark for 2 hours, then were able to climb down and take shelter in a barn as the water receded slightly.  They waited for an additional 12 hours until they were finally rescued by boat.  Two young men were attempting to drive from a home in Marble Falls to Leander via FM 1431 sometime in the early morning hours of June 27 when their jeep was swept into high water east of Marble Falls. The vehicle was located a few days later in a creek about 10 miles east of Marble Falls.  The body of one of the young men was recovered several days later but the remains of the other young man have not been found.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 137.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Phenomenal rainfall totals occurred during this period, ranging anywhere from 8 inches, to as much as 20 inches, heaviest across southeast Kansas. A few the most extreme and measured rainfall reports from June 28th - 30th were 18.29 inches at Fredonia, 12.47 inches at Independence, 11.70 inches at Iola, 9.18 inches at Chanute, 8.63 inches at Erie and 8.40 inches at Coffeyville. Excessive runoff produced widespread, catastrophic, record flooding across much of southeast Kansas, particularly in the vicinity of area rivers, streams and creeks. Hardest hit were the Verdigris and Fall Rivers, where record flooding was observed at Fall River, Independence and Coffeyville. The Neosho River was also hard hit with record flooding observed at Erie and major flooding observed at Chanute, Parsons and Oswego. Public, private and crop damage was extensive and at times severe. Hundreds to potentially a few thousand homes and businesses sustained severe flood damage, an incalculable number of roads were closed due to high water, and several bridges were either washed out or sustained damage. Thousands of acres of crops sustained severe damage. Thousands of miles of roads were damaged from the flood waters. Evacuations and water rescues were common, as several towns were for a time surrounded and/or engulfed by flood waters. Water became unsafe, as flood waters inundated water and sewage treatment plants. Thousands of residents were without power for an extended period of time. Several counties were declared federal disaster areas. Public and private damages likely exceeded hundreds of millions of dollars, but exact monetary values will be difficult to nearly impossible to determine. The flooding in Coffeyville enveloped the Coffeyville Resources Refinery. A malfunctioning pump lead to a 71,000 gallon crude oil spill into the Verdigris River, leaving an oily gunk on everything the oil touched, and contaminating the water for miles. One fatality occurred in Coffeyville, when a gentleman refused to evacuate his motel room, despite being warned twice by emergency officials of the impending flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Extremely heavy rainfall from the end of June into early July caused flash flooding throughout Montgomery County. The hardest hit areas were Independence and Coffeyville. The flash flooding combined with the ensuing record river flooding along the Verdigris River led to at least 500 homes being destroyed with another 55 sustaining major damages. Businesses in the county reported 23 million in losses and the cost to public infrastructure resulted in another 4 million in damages. Additionally, 43,000 acres of cropland were flooded. The Verdigris River also overtopped a levee protecting the refinery in Coffeyville resulting in an oily toxic mess that inundated areas downstream. The Verdigris River at Independence crested at 52.4 feet in the morning hours of July 1st. This was 22.4 feet above flood stage. At Coffeyville the river crested at 30.7 feet the evening of July 1st which is 12.7 above flood stage. Again, both of these crests were records. The river remained above flood stage for both cities until July 7th. Unfortunately there was one fatality. A 55 year old man was found in the Budget Inn in Coffeyville. An autopsy revealed that the individual died as a result of drowning. This tragedy was compounded by the fact that the individual was warned twice that floodwaters would inundate the hotel but on both occasions the individual refused to leave. The Coffeyville Journal and the Arkansas City Traveler contributed to this report.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 81.15M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tropical depression moved northwest over the Edwards Plateau toward west Texas. Erin maintained her depression status as it then began to move northeast into southwest Oklahoma between Hollis and Erick during the afternoon hours of Saturday, August 18th. A very tropical airmass was in place along and east of this feature, extending into western and central Oklahoma. Heavy rainfall developed along and east of the center, which moved slowly to the northeast. Low-level wind shear north and east of Erin increased throughout the evening, with several tornadoes reported in Kiowa, Washita, and Grady counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Damage was reported east of Hobart, and in Washita county south and east of Cordell.

Wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph were also reported over parts of central Oklahoma at this time. As with the wind speeds, thunderstorms intensities increased, with two additional tornadoes reported over central Oklahoma Sunday morning. In addition to tornadoes and very strong winds, rainfall rates of over three inches per hour were common, with significant flash flooding reported in numerous counties.

Erin moved onshore near Lamar, TX as a weak tropical storm, but was quickly downgraded to a tropical depression as it moved over land. The tropical depression moved northwest over the Edwards Plateau toward west Texas. Erin maintained her depression status as it then began to move northeast into southwest Oklahoma between Hollis and Erick during the afternoon hours of Saturday, August 18th. A very tropical airmass was in place along and east of this feature, extending into western and central Oklahoma. Heavy rainfall developed along and east of the center, which moved slowly to the northeast. Low-level wind shear north and east of Erin increased throughout the evening, with several tornadoes reported in Kiowa, Washita, and Grady counties during the late afternoon and early evening hours. Damage was reported east of Hobart, and in Washita county south and east of Cordell. As the evening progressed, a strong low-level jet developed, with additional thunderstorms developing over southwest and central Oklahoma. Remarkably, the center of the tropical depression strengthened between 1 and 7 AM, with a compact area of sustained winds of 35 to 45 MPH concentrated around the center of the depression. Wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph were also reported over parts of central Oklahoma at this time. As with the wind speeds, thunderstorms intensities increased, with two additional tornadoes reported over central Oklahoma Sunday morning. In addition to tornadoes and very strong winds, rainfall rates of over three inches per hour were common, with significant flash flooding reported in numerous counties. Rainfall amounts exceeded five inches over a large area, with some locations receiving eight to ten inches. Rivers and creeks easily exceeded their banks, with water also rising quickly in many towns.

The first storm brought rain to the lower elevations and gusty winds and very heavy snow to the mountains and deserts. Blizzard conditions forced the closure of mountain highways while heavy rain caused a debris flow in the Santiago Burn Area. Snowfall accumulations from this first storm measured 31 inches at Big Bear Lake, 30 inches at Running Springs, and 24 inches at Forest Falls. The second storm on the 17th was notable for its significant rains in the low deserts and heavy snowfall in the mountains and high deserts. Heavy rain caused significant flooding in the Tijauna River valley. Surface offshore pressure gradients and mid-level easterly flow brought dry air into the region, resulting in widespread evaporative cooling and snow levels down to the desert floor. The winter storm dumped 20 inches of snow in Pinon Hills, 18 inches of snow in Hesperia, Lucerne Valley, Palomar Mountain, and Julian, 16 inches of snow in Idyllwild, 14 inches in Victorville, and even 4 inches in Shelter Valley. Local snowfall amounts in excess of 2 feet occurred in the San Bernardino Mountains. Total snowfall accumulations at Big Bear Lake for the 5 day period ending on the 17th was an impressive 54 inches.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Significant flooding in the Tijuana River Valley resulted in the deaths of a Tijuana man and numerous ranch and farm animals. At least 21 people had to be rescued, including 6 by helicopter. Three men were taken to a hospital and treated for hypothermia. An estimated 70 horses were also rescued. Three horses drowned before they could be rescued and another horse was later euthanized due to a leg injury. Fifteen goats and an unknown number of dogs also died in the flood. One farmer lost $600,000 dollars worth of his crop while another lost $10,000 dollars worth of watermelons. The one human death occurred outside the forecast area in Tijuana, Mexico. The flash flood occurred when both the Tijuana River and a nearby flood control channel became dammed with with sediment, trash, and other debris.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was caused by a damaged portion of the underground Nogales Wash. Local emergency management reported that water burst through the underground wash onto the surface just across the International Border. The border wall acted as a dam, keeping most of the flooding on the Mexican side. However, some water did flow through the port of entry into downtown Nogales, Arizona. Several businesses in the downtown business district experienced flooding and two illegal immigrants found two days later in the underground wash are also believed to have drowned due to this flooding. In addition, three illegal immigrants in an underground flood channel beneath the international border were rescued.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 600.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This allowed a strong southerly flow to transport copious amounts of moisture from the deep south into the Midwest.  Several waves of low pressure moved along a nearly stationary frontal boundary that remained just south of the forecast area, across northern Arkansas and extreme southern Illinois. Several rounds of rain and thunderstorms brought locally heavy rainfall to much of the forecast area, with the greatest amounts confined along and south of Interstate 44 in Missouri and Interstate 70 in Illinois. Total rainfall ranged from less than an inch across portions of west central Illinois to almost 10 inches in southern Reynolds County, Missouri. The excessive rainfall led to flash flooding of low lying areas and major flooding on local rivers and creeks for the next week. Many people were affected by this event, with millions of dollars in damage recorded across the forecast area.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Very heavy rain fell over Reynolds county beginning late on the 17th of March and throughout the day on the 18th. The co-operative observer in Ellington reported a storm total of 9.7 inches. Four inches of rain fell in Ellington through 8 am on the 18th, then another 2 inches fell between 8 am and 11 am on the 18th, with an additional 3.7 inches in the hours after that. This caused the creeks in the area to rise rapidly including Logan Creek which flows through the middle of Ellington.  The creek began to rise rapidly around 7 am, rising nearly 10 feet by noon. Around 8 am, an 81 year old man was trying to clear some flood debris from a bridge that goes over the creek next to his business and was possibly knocked into the flood waters by a camper trailer that had been washed away from its location.  He was pronounced dead at 830 am.  A number of homes and businesses were flooded in town and several propane tanks were floating in the flood waters. Numerous roads throughout Reynolds county were flooded due to the heavy rains.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 400.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Surface temperatures warmed into the 80s with dew point readings in the low to mid 70s.  A semi-stationary front extended northeast from the low, across northern Iowa during the afternoon into the evening hours.  The atmosphere became very unstable with MUCAPE in the 4500 to 5000 J/kg range by mid afternoon and lifted indices around -7 C.  The shear was quite high, between 40 and 70 kts.  Downdraft CAPW was between 1000 and 1300 J/kg with cape in the -10 to -30 C. layer of the atmosphere around 400 J/kg.  The LCL was in the 750 to 1000 meter range, with the lowest over north central Iowa.  With the exception of one hail report of 3 inch diameter hail report in north central Iowa, hail size was somewhat limited by the freezing level of 15500 to 16500 feet.  A very strong transport of moisture took place on a 50 to 75 kt 850 mb jet.  Precipitable water values soared to 1.6 to 1.9 inches by evening.  During the initial phase of the severe event, high winds and hail were reported along the line of thunderstorms that formed from northern into west central Iowa.  There were four reports of tornadoes in Worth, Winnebago and Cerro Gordo Counties during the afternoon hours of the 7th.  This was with the initial round of storms.  One of the tornadoes in Winnebago County destroyed a hog confinement building containing 3500 hogs.  Several of them were killed and the remaining hogs needed to be taken to slaughter.  The event transitioned into a flooding event overnight, then tornadoes began again during the afternoon of the 8th.  A tornado touched down in Taylor County.  Windows were blown out of houses there and several trees were twisted and blown down around the house.  A pole shed was completely destroyed south of Ferguson in Marshall County.  A stronger tornado was on the ground north to northeast of Ottumwa.  A home lost a roof, with a wall of one room partially collapsed by the tornado.  Several trees were also downed around the home.  The event transitioned into a major Flood/Flash Flood event during the evening and early morning hours with many locations reporting 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and spotty amounts of around 5 inches in just a few hours time.  The line moved very little for a period of several hours.  During the predawn hours, the line became broad and weakened to generally below severe limits.  A new round of thunderstorms from Nebraska, which was the southwest part of the extensive line, moved into  west central and southwest Iowa.  The storm generally remained below severe levels for the most part, but they did produce very heavy rains.    Another line of thunderstorms formed/re-intensified along the frontal boundary by the early afternoon hours.  Initially, the storms produced strong winds and some small hail.  As they moved southeast, several reports of high winds to near 70 MPH and a few reports of tornadoes were received.  The most significant weather feature with this event was the heavy rainfall.  The antecedent soil conditions in Iowa were extremely wet, such that flash flooding was caused by rainfall of an inch or more in an hour, even in rural areas.  Heavy rainfall of 3 to 6 inches occurred in a broad swath extending from west central into north central, and parts of central and northeast Iowa.  This resulted in widespread flash flooding.  Eventually, the rain lead to major to record flooding along many of the rivers in the state.  At one point or another, about 40 of the DMX 51 counties in the CWA were under flash flood warning.  The situation was very serious over the north central and northeast counties.  A levy was breached in the Mason City area as the Winnebago River rose to 3 feet over the record stage.  The city was inundated by water.  The water treatment plant was under water and non operational, all power was lost to the power grid in the city.  The river cut a new channel and changed course into the downtown area.  In the New Hartford area, a dam broke on Beaver Creek, resulting in the water level rising 2 feet above the all-time record level.  High water along the mainstem Cedar River also caused communities to lose water.  Nashua lost water as the water plant became flooded.  Flooding along the Shell Rock River resulted in water supply loss in the town of Rockford.  There was one death that resulted from the flooding.  A 33 year old man died as he drove into flood waters in Interstate 35 at mile post 141 in Hamilton County.

Copious amounts of moisture were available that allowed repeated heavy rains.  Additionally, there was sufficient vertical wind shear to allow for the generation of supercell thunderstorms with rotating updrafts that led to seven tornadoes in this part of the state of Wisconsin.  The flooding rains constituted the 2nd round/punch of heavy rains that led to more widespread and severe flash flooding and record-setting river flooding (1st punch was Jun 7-9, 2008).||The axis of heavy rains on June 12th extended from Lafayette County northeast through Dane County to eastern Green Lake County and western Fond du Lac County.  Generally 4 to 6 inches fell in this area, with 1 to 4 inches elsewhere.  The generous rains in June at Milwuakee led to a montly total of 12.27 inches.  This easily broke the record for highest June rainfall total. The previous record was 10.13 inches, set in 1917, and also makes June, 2008, the wettest month ever at Milwaukee.||The Rock River crested at all-time record high levels at the following gauage sites:  Waupun (10.07' on 6/13), Horicon (10.29' on 6/17), Watertown (7.81' on 6/13), Jefferson (15.64' on 6/18), Ft. Atkinson (10.85' on 6/21), Newville (15.12' on 6/21), Indianford (18.33' on 6/21), and Afton (13.51' on 6/21).  Likewise, the Crawfish River set a new all-time high crest of 13.59' on 6/16 at Milford, and Beaver Dam Creek set a new record of 843.53' on 6/16 at Beaver Dam.  Other, new, all-time record high crests include 4.47' on 6/9 on the Bark River at Rome, 4.95' on 6/13 on the Mukwonago River at Mukwonago, 11.41' on 6/8 on Oak Creek in South Milwaukee, 13.93' on 6/13 on the Milwaukee River near Cedarburg, 13.54' on 6/15 on the Fox River at Burlington, and 15.18' on 6/15 on the Fox River at New Munster.||High water levels generaged major road blocks, for various periods, on Interstate 94 in Jefferson and Waukesha Counties, on Interstate 894 in Milwaukee, and on Interstate 39/90/94 in Columbia County near Portage.  Most inland lakes rose to high levels that resulted in minor shoreline damage to piers, etc.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rains led to flash flooding that generated water levels of 2 to 4 feet deep on many low-lying roads, especially near existing lakes.

In fact, these storms exhibited very high rainfall rates, which led to 1 to 2 inch rainfall amounts in an hour. As the storms congealed into a larger scale line of thunderstorms, they continued to move over the same areas, which led to significant flash flooding through the evening and overnight. ||On June 8, the warm front was lingering across the region, but a cold front approached out of the northern Plains. Showers and storms would redevelop during the day in the vicinity of the warm front, while a line of storms developed out ahead of the cold front, with these tracking across the region Sunday night. Again, copious amounts of moisture lead to periods of heavy rain. ||The heavy rainfall on June 8 enhanced the already dangerous flooding conditions across parts of northeast Iowa. Many roads were already closed from the June 7 rains due to water over the roadways, mudslides, or partial washouts. Conditions only worsened, leading to more road closures, sandbagging, and some evacuations.||While the rain was tapering off and moving east Sunday night, June 8, the rivers continued to rise, and some extremely quickly. Some rivers responded with a foot per hour rises, while others eventually exceeded their river gauges ability to record the river levels. These gauges were under water themselves! All-time record crests were set at a few locations, with top 5 records at many others.||Damage to infrastructure and crops was preliminarily estimated at 70 to 80 million dollars. As a result, Mitchell, Floyd, Howard, Chickasaw, Winneshiek, Fayette, Allamakee and Clayton Counties were all declared federal disaster areas.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Excessive rainfall caused fairly widespread flash flooding across the county. Steep terrain enhanced the flash flood threat causing mud slides and damaged infrastructure. Numerous roads were washed out and bridges damaged. A mud slide at Camp Tahigwa Girl Scout camp near Dorchester trapped part of the staff, but no one was injured. In Dorchester, the Waterloo Creek flash flooded swamping several mobile homes or trailers and cars along Highway 76. Water swept through town very quickly trapping people on their cars and roof tops.

The flooding affected many municipalities island wide.  The torrential rainfall resulted in severe flooding to rivers, streams, and roads, causing sinkholes, land/mudslides, and structural collapses mainly across the southern half of the island.  Specifically, the heaviest rainfall, and most severe effects, occurred across the municipalities of Cabo Rojo, Guayama, Humacao, Patillas, Ponce, and Yabucoa, where in some locations, totals approaching 30 inches of rainfall fell in a three-day period, ending at 8 am Tuesday, September 23, 2008.The heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding were a direct result of a large tropical disturbance that moved slowly west across the island.  On occasion, tropical disturbances may develop into tropical depressions and, upon further intensification, get named by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) as a tropical storm and/or hurricane. While the National Weather Service (NWS) in San Juan and the NHC closely monitored the system for possible organization into a named storm, multiple reconnaissance flights flown through the disturbance revealed no closed, low-level, surface circulation, which was needed to satisfy the definition of a tropical depression.  It was not until 5 pm Thursday, September 25, 2008 when the system, located about 380 miles north northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico, was named Tropical Storm Kyle. The strongest effects of the tropical disturbance were first felt in Puerto Rico on Sunday, September 21, 2008.  The most intense rainfall occurred in the 24-hour period starting at 8 am Sunday, September 21, 2008 through 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008, with the highest rainfall rates occurring during the overnight hours from sunset on Sunday to sunrise on Monday.  The largest rainfall amounts for the 24-hour period ending 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008  were 22.03 inches in Patillas, 20.00 inches in Guayama, 16.00 inches in Cabo Rojo, 14.83 inches in Yabucoa, and 10.81 inches in Ponce.  For the combined three-day period, some of these numbers increase further with 29.83 inches in Patillas, 21.86 inches in Yabucoa, 20.52 inches in Ponce, and 17.82 inches in Cabo Rojo.  Lesser, but just as significant, amounts, ranging from 5-15 inches of rain, fell across much of the island.  The torrential rainfall seen across the island was immediately seen across the extensive river network in Puerto Rico.  Some rivers, including the Rio Gurabo, saw water levels rise in excess of 25 feet in less than 12 hours.  Parts of the island that were spared the worst of the rain include the northern and northwestern coast, were only moderate rain showers were experienced.  The total rainfall amounts recorded from this event are unique in that the 29.83 inches seen in Patillas exceeds the weekly total rainfall of 27.13 inches measured in Juana Diaz during the October 1985 flood event.  The 24-hour rainfall totals ending at 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008, which encompassed parts of the southeastern section of the island, including the municipalities of Patillas and Guayama, exceeded 200-year 24-hour rainfall totals.  Specifically for Patillas, the recorded rainfall amount approaches the 500-year 24-hour rainfall totals.  Along the southwestern section of the island, Cabo Rojo���s 24 hour rainfall also exceeded the 100-year return period. Across the southern municipalities of Puerto Rico, Ponce and Yauco���s 24-hour rainfall rates exceeded the 10-year 24-hour rainfall totals, Juana Diaz exceeded the 25-year rainfall totals, and Yabucoa, along the southeast coast, exceeded the 25-year rainfall totals. The resultant flooding had considerable effects on the local population. Six fatalities were reported, three direct deaths due to drowning, and 3 indirect heart attack deaths related to stress induced flooding. An estimated 630 people in the affected areas were evacuated to shelters. In addition to structural damage caused by the flood waters, agricultural damage was sustained by coffee, plantains, and other minor crops, damage was preliminarily estimated at 23 million. In response to the significant flooding, federal authorities issued a disaster declaration for portions of the island.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flooding was reported at Brisas del Prado, Olympic Ville, Palma Royale, La Estancia, in Las Piedras.

The flooding affected many municipalities island wide.  The torrential rainfall resulted in severe flooding to rivers, streams, and roads, causing sinkholes, land/mudslides, and structural collapses mainly across the southern half of the island.  Specifically, the heaviest rainfall, and most severe effects, occurred across the municipalities of Cabo Rojo, Guayama, Humacao, Patillas, Ponce, and Yabucoa, where in some locations, totals approaching 30 inches of rainfall fell in a three-day period, ending at 8 am Tuesday, September 23, 2008.The heavy rainfall and subsequent flooding were a direct result of a large tropical disturbance that moved slowly west across the island.  On occasion, tropical disturbances may develop into tropical depressions and, upon further intensification, get named by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) as a tropical storm and/or hurricane. While the National Weather Service (NWS) in San Juan and the NHC closely monitored the system for possible organization into a named storm, multiple reconnaissance flights flown through the disturbance revealed no closed, low-level, surface circulation, which was needed to satisfy the definition of a tropical depression.  It was not until 5 pm Thursday, September 25, 2008 when the system, located about 380 miles north northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico, was named Tropical Storm Kyle. The strongest effects of the tropical disturbance were first felt in Puerto Rico on Sunday, September 21, 2008.  The most intense rainfall occurred in the 24-hour period starting at 8 am Sunday, September 21, 2008 through 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008, with the highest rainfall rates occurring during the overnight hours from sunset on Sunday to sunrise on Monday.  The largest rainfall amounts for the 24-hour period ending 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008  were 22.03 inches in Patillas, 20.00 inches in Guayama, 16.00 inches in Cabo Rojo, 14.83 inches in Yabucoa, and 10.81 inches in Ponce.  For the combined three-day period, some of these numbers increase further with 29.83 inches in Patillas, 21.86 inches in Yabucoa, 20.52 inches in Ponce, and 17.82 inches in Cabo Rojo.  Lesser, but just as significant, amounts, ranging from 5-15 inches of rain, fell across much of the island.  The torrential rainfall seen across the island was immediately seen across the extensive river network in Puerto Rico.  Some rivers, including the Rio Gurabo, saw water levels rise in excess of 25 feet in less than 12 hours.  Parts of the island that were spared the worst of the rain include the northern and northwestern coast, were only moderate rain showers were experienced.  The total rainfall amounts recorded from this event are unique in that the 29.83 inches seen in Patillas exceeds the weekly total rainfall of 27.13 inches measured in Juana Diaz during the October 1985 flood event.  The 24-hour rainfall totals ending at 8 am Monday, September 22, 2008, which encompassed parts of the southeastern section of the island, including the municipalities of Patillas and Guayama, exceeded 200-year 24-hour rainfall totals.  Specifically for Patillas, the recorded rainfall amount approaches the 500-year 24-hour rainfall totals.  Along the southwestern section of the island, Cabo Rojo���s 24 hour rainfall also exceeded the 100-year return period. Across the southern municipalities of Puerto Rico, Ponce and Yauco���s 24-hour rainfall rates exceeded the 10-year 24-hour rainfall totals, Juana Diaz exceeded the 25-year rainfall totals, and Yabucoa, along the southeast coast, exceeded the 25-year rainfall totals. The resultant flooding had considerable effects on the local population. Six fatalities were reported, three direct deaths due to drowning, and 3 indirect heart attack deaths related to stress induced flooding. An estimated 630 people in the affected areas were evacuated to shelters. In addition to structural damage caused by the flood waters, agricultural damage was sustained by coffee, plantains, and other minor crops, damage was preliminarily estimated at 23 million. In response to the significant flooding, federal authorities issued a disaster declaration for portions of the island.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flooding was reported at Barrio Olimpo, Barrio Machete along road 744, Villa Capo along road 179 in Guayama.

Major flooding was noted in many other areas of north and central Georgia, including the eastern suburbs of Atlanta, northwest Georgia, and parts of central Georgia.  The culprit was a very stagnant upper atmospheric pattern featuring a weak upper low that developed in early September across south Texas and slowly migrated east-northeast through September 22nd, until a more significant upper trough dropping south into the southern plains finally moved the pesky upper low northeast of Georgia.  In addition, an unusually deep tropical flow was noted throughout this period.  Precipitable water values exceeded 2.0 inches across the area during much of this period, resulting in extremely efficient rain producing cells.  Persistent heavy rain showers and thunderstorms began to plague the area on the 16th, and persisted daily through the 21st across parts of north and central Georgia.||However, the catastrophic flooding unfolded when a sea breeze moving northwest merged with existing outflow boundaries and higher terrain across the western suburbs of Atlanta to result in persistent heavy thunderstorms for a period of at least 12 hours that trained across the same counties west of Atlanta, generally affecting Carroll, Douglas, Paulding and Cobb counties.  As the activity progressed across the state, significant flooding unfolded further east, including Fulton county, and the city of Atlanta, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties.  Incredible rainfall amounts of 15 to over 20 inches, were observed from northeast Carroll, through much of Douglas, into eastern Paulding and southern Cobb counties.  Rainfall amounts of 10 to 15 inches were noted across parts of Fulton, Dekalb, and Gwinnett.  Rainfall amounts of 8 to 12 inches were noted in other more spotty areas of northwest, north central, and central Georgia during this period.||The excessive rainfall on top of saturated ground resulted in some of the worst flooding ever reported in the Atlanta and north Georgia area.  Eleven deaths were recorded during the event, mostly vehicle related deaths at night from washed out bridges and roads as a result of swollen creeks.  Property damages are estimated to be at least $0.5 Billion, with hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed by flood waters.  Bridges on several state and local highways were washed out and some will take months to even a year to replace.   Eighteen counties (Bartow, Carroll, Chattooga, Cherokee, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Heard, Newton, Paulding, Rockdale, Stephens, and Walker) received a presidential disaster declaration as a result of the historic floods.  Twenty-one counties were declared eligible for public assistance, including several central Georgia counties that were affected by flash flooding earlier in the period.||Some of the worst flooding was observed along Sweetwater Creek near the Cobb, Fulton, Douglas county line.  Hundreds of homes were flooded and destroyed as the waters of Sweetwater Creek rose more than 20 feet above flood level.||Many main stem and secondary creeks, streams, and rivers across north and central Georgia, particularly in northwest and west central Georgia, reached record flood levels.

Rainfall exceeded 12 inches in portions of the county during the night and early morning hours.  USGS stream gages verified that significant flooding was underway.  Crooked Creek at Norcross exceeded its flood stage of 11 feet at 306 am EDT.  Pew Creek near Lawrenceville reached its flood stage of 11 feet at 418 am EDT.  Many roads became flooded and impassable as they were submerged by several feet of water in some areas.  A 39-year old female lost her life as her vehicle was washed off Desiree Drive and she was carried away in the flood waters of a small tributary feeding into the Yellow River.  Many homes, apartments, businesses and roads from Norcross to Lawrenceville to Lilburn were flooded during this time frame.  Monetary damage to roads and property during this period was estimated to exceed $600,000.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.63M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Major flooding was noted in many other areas of north and central Georgia, including the eastern suburbs of Atlanta, northwest Georgia, and parts of central Georgia.  The culprit was a very stagnant upper atmospheric pattern featuring a weak upper low that developed in early September across south Texas and slowly migrated east-northeast through September 22nd, until a more significant upper trough dropping south into the southern plains finally moved the pesky upper low northeast of Georgia.  In addition, an unusually deep tropical flow was noted throughout this period.  Precipitable water values exceeded 2.0 inches across the area during much of this period, resulting in extremely efficient rain producing cells.  Persistent heavy rain showers and thunderstorms began to plague the area on the 16th, and persisted daily through the 21st across parts of north and central Georgia.||However, the catastrophic flooding unfolded when a sea breeze moving northwest merged with existing outflow boundaries and higher terrain across the western suburbs of Atlanta to result in persistent heavy thunderstorms for a period of at least 12 hours that trained across the same counties west of Atlanta, generally affecting Carroll, Douglas, Paulding and Cobb counties.  As the activity progressed across the state, significant flooding unfolded further east, including Fulton county, and the city of Atlanta, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties.  Incredible rainfall amounts of 15 to over 20 inches, were observed from northeast Carroll, through much of Douglas, into eastern Paulding and southern Cobb counties.  Rainfall amounts of 10 to 15 inches were noted across parts of Fulton, Dekalb, and Gwinnett.  Rainfall amounts of 8 to 12 inches were noted in other more spotty areas of northwest, north central, and central Georgia during this period.||The excessive rainfall on top of saturated ground resulted in some of the worst flooding ever reported in the Atlanta and north Georgia area.  Eleven deaths were recorded during the event, mostly vehicle related deaths at night from washed out bridges and roads as a result of swollen creeks.  Property damages are estimated to be at least $0.5 Billion, with hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed by flood waters.  Bridges on several state and local highways were washed out and some will take months to even a year to replace.   Eighteen counties (Bartow, Carroll, Chattooga, Cherokee, Cobb, Coweta, DeKalb, Douglas, Fulton, Gwinnett, Heard, Newton, Paulding, Rockdale, Stephens, and Walker) received a presidential disaster declaration as a result of the historic floods.  Twenty-one counties were declared eligible for public assistance, including several central Georgia counties that were affected by flash flooding earlier in the period.||Some of the worst flooding was observed along Sweetwater Creek near the Cobb, Fulton, Douglas county line.

The mobile home was located in a trailer park near Snake Creek, which was observed to have been nearly 20 feet deep.  Local law enforcement officials note that the creek is normally only at a depth of two to three feet.  It took nearly four hours to rescue the three other residents of the home, a man, wife, and 1-year old boy, which were found clinging to trees several yards downstream.

Flash flood deaths are documented as follows.  The first flash flood death occurred at 1030 pm EDT when a 44-year old female was attempting to cross Mobley Creek at Banks Mill Road and was swept away in her Jeep Liberty.  The second flash flood death occurred at 1100 pm EDT when a 29-year old male was swept way in his sport utility vehicle while attempting to cross Pool Creek at Poole Mill Road.  The third flash flood death was that of a 26-year old female who also was attempting to cross Mobley Creek at Banks Mill Road.  The fourth flash flood death was that of a 27-year old male attempting to cross Town Branch Creek at Mann Road.  The fifth flash flood death in Douglas county occurred where Stewart's Mill Road crosses Anneewakee Creek when a 49-year old nurse was swept away in her vehicle while attempting to cross the creek.  She was on her way to work at the time.  The sixth flash flood death in Douglas county was that of a 55-year old male.  He was swept away in his Ford Ranger pickup truck while attempting to cross West Bully Creek on North Helton Road.  Numerous other high water rescues took place.  Many took place via boat to rescue people from flood homes, businesses, and vehicles.||During this time frame, damage was estimated to be close to $1 million.

A mother and child subsequently drove off the washed out roadway, and drowned in the flood waters. A second vehicle following behind also drove into the creek at the same place, but the occupants were successfully rescued.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These storms at times produced the full gamut of severe weather, including large hail, damaging winds, tornadoes and flooding. Portions of Marion, Harvey, Butler, Sedgwick and McPherson counties were especially affected by straight-line damaging winds, as a pair or bow echoes surged east to northeast across the area, inflicting damage to numerous barns, outbuildings and some other structures, uprooting trees and downing power poles. Additionally, a handful of relatively weak, short-lived tornadoes skipped across portions of Sumner, Cowley, Butler, Marion and Sedgwick counties during the afternoon and evening hours on the 25th and 26th. A tornado near Lake Afton in southwest Sedgwick county inflicted moderate damage to a residence, and also injured two people. Furthermore, heavy thunderstorms training over the same areas produced widespread areal flooding, river flooding and flash flooding across mainly south-central, east-central and southeast Kansas. Numerous rural and city roads were flooded and subsequently closed due to high water. Various water rescues were needed for stranded motorists, as well as homeowners threatened by flood waters. Numerous homes and businesses were flooded, along with the Cowley County Fairgrounds. Sadly, three flooding deaths occurred, one in Greenwood county and two in Labette county. Some injuries occurred as well.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rainfall from numerous thunderstorms during the afternoon, evening and overnight hours on the 26th produced widespread flooding across much of Harper county. Rainfall amounts across the county ranged from 3 to 6 inches. Numerous roads were closed countywide. It is estimated that around 100 homes were flooded or received some form of water damage in the Anthony area, along with several other homes and businesses across the county. Portions of the elementary school and hospital in Harper were flooded. Three water rescues took place, one of which produced an injury near Third Lake Road when a vehicle attempted to cross a flooded roadway. Crop damage estimates are unknown, and property damage values are rough estimates. The Wichita Eagle, Harper Advocate, Anthony Republican and the Hutchinson News contributed to this report.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Reports indicated one to three feet of water was present on some city streets. The flash flooding floated several cars and sent storm drains shooting wildly into the air. One storm drain cover injured an individual as the surging water displaced it. Emergency management estimated anywhere from 800 to 1000 structures, mainly homes, were impacted by the flooding.||In addition to hundreds of impacted homes, many well known locations also sustained damage, including the Nicolaysen Art Museum, Wyoming Medical Center, Central Wyoming Fairgrounds, Three Crowns Golf Course, and several city school buildings. Major damage also occurred at Casper College where five buildings, including the gymnasium and theater, were significantly impacted. Retaining wall bricks and landscape gravel were washed from a hillside at the college and cascaded to neighboring residences and streets below. The Hall of Justice on North David Street also sustained significant damage when water poured through a door into an underground garage.

Trees as large as two to three feet in diameter were downed. Power outages were scattered throughout the region as the winds downed power lines.|The unprecedented heavy rains that fell���four to six inches in less than two hours���resulted in some of the worst flash flooding the area has seen. Parts of Erie, Chautauqua, Cattaraugus and Allegany counties received State and Federal Disaster Declarations. In the Village of Silver Creek an entire mobile home park along Silver Creek was washed away. The flood waters continued through the heart of the village through the fire station, police headquarters and highway department. Several police cars, an ambulance and much of the town���s highway equipment were lost. In Irving, the flood waters flowed across parts of the New York State Thruway and Routes 5 and 20. Water flooded portions of Lakeshore Hospital there. Also in Irving, the Seneca Nation sustained almost two million dollars in damage to roads and bridges. In total, in Chautauqua county hundreds of homes were damaged and 45 homes were condemned, including the 35 mobile homes of the aforementioned park. In the Village of Gowanda (part of which is in Erie County and part in Cattaraugus county), extensive flash flooding occurred. Tri-County hospital in Gowanda was inundated by flood waters. Patients were transferred to Lakeshore Hospital in Irving. Several hundred homes sustained damage and 40 homes were condemned there. One fatality occurred in Gowanda as an 80-year-old man ventured out to check a bridge on his property and was swept away by the flood waters. The gage on Cattaraugus Creek at Gowanda showed a rise from six feet to near 13 feet in less than an hour (flood stage is 10 feet). Throughout Cattaraugus county over one-quarter of the roads were damaged or lost.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 45.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Numerous impacts were felt in the region, with heavy rain, wind damage, and hail. ||The most severe weather took place in portions of eastern Kansas and western Missouri, as a strong bow echo moved through the area near and just after the midnight hour.  Embedded in this bow echo were small features called meso-vortices, which can often times cause local intensifications of the strong straightline winds, or even produce weak spinnup tornadoes.  One such feature embedded in a smaller bowing storm segment south of the Plattsburg area, led to reports of a damaged greenhouse, tree damage, as well as damage to other nearby structures.  It was determined, that a combination of enhanced straight line winds as well as a very brief and weak (EF0) tornado, produced winds as high as 70 to 85 mph in this area.  Further to the south, strong straight line winds, also blew over trees and caused other forms of property damage, to fences and homes in areas around Kansas City. Several observations of 60 to 70 mph winds were observed in the area. ||However, the biggest impact from this event, was the persistent heavy rain due to the training of storms over the same areas.  The hardest hit areas were in the Kirksville and Chillicothe areas, where rainfall totals in the 3 to 6 inch range were common.  Elsewhere, while rainfall amounts may have been lower, the rapid rainfall rates in excess of 2 per hour, caused localized flash flooding in portions of the Kansas City Metropoitan area and elsewhere. The heavy rains caused many rivers and creeks to go out of their banks.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flash flooding caused pavement over a culvert to give way.

Numerous homes and cars were flooded. One person died, and at least 136 people were injured. Damage was estimated at $5.5 million in Oklahoma county alone.||The event began late on June 13th, as thunderstorms developed over northwest Oklahoma. The thunderstorms developed ahead of a slow moving cold front that was located over southwest Kansas into the northern Texas panhandle. A large outflow boundary also extended eastward. The thunderstorms became more numerous as they moved along the outflow boundary.  Strengthened by the new rainfall, the outflow boundary dropped toward central Oklahoma, and a very moist low-level jet resulted in new thunderstorm development near the boundary.||The first round of significant rain impacted central Oklahoma around 3 am. This round moved east before another, longer lived, thunderstorm complex developed over the Oklahoma City metro area. The outflow boundary was located south of Interstate 40, and the low-level jet transported warm and unseasonably humid air north of the boundary, creating very heavy rain. Thunderstorms continued to develop over the southwest metro area, and slowly moved northeast. Rainfall rates averaged one to two inches per hour, with some thunderstorm bands producing rates near three inches per hour.||The heavy rain accumulated quickly immediately before and during the busy morning drive time. Numerous cars became stranded in the rapidly rising water. Roadways were covered by rapidly flowing water, and ponds, creeks, and rivers easily spilled over their banks. Navigating in and around the metro area became almost impossible, and many motorists had to be rescued by boat. After several hours, the persistent heavy rainfall tapered off around noon.||The larger area of heavy rainfall moved south as the outflow boundary moved into southern Oklahoma. Significant rain developed over southwest Oklahoma by early afternoon, and flash flooding once again became a problem. Lawton was hard hit, receiving between four and five inches of rain, resulting in several roadways becoming flooded. Numerous motorists had to be rescued from the high water. One motorist, unfortunately, lost his life when his vehicle stalled in flood waters.||Thunderstorms developed again over central Oklahoma late in the afternoon and evening, but luckily the duration of the thunderstorms was relatively short. By the time it was all said and done, widespread totals of five to nine inches were reported over much of Oklahoma City. Will Rogers World Airport reported its largest daily precipitation since records began in 1891, with 7.62 inches. Even higher totals were reported over the north-central portion of Oklahoma City, where nine to twelve inches was measured.||Strong winds caused some power outages during the event. At the peak of the event, over 6700 people were without power. Isolated pockets of wind damage did occur, with a power pole/power lines downed south of Drummond in Garfield county.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Numerous roads were closed due to high water. Several motorists had to be rescued after their automobiles stalled in the high water. One person drowned while trying to push his car out of the high water near NW Farris and 13th Street.

A man also fell to his death after leaning over the railing of a highway bridge and falling 240 feet into the raging creek below.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A woman was swept away in flood waters near the intersection of Walters Road and KY Hwy 1460 east of Pikeville.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

CAPE rose to 3500-4500 J/kg by the mid to late afternoon with lifted indices of -8 to -10 C.  The moisture pooled over the state with precipitable water values approaching 2 inches by evening.  High temperatures reached the upper 80s to low 90s, with dewpoints topping out in the upper 70s to low 80s.  The atmosphere was fairly weakly sheared with 30 kts of available shear.  Downdraft CAPE was between 1000 and 1800 J/kg.  Available CAPE in the -10 to -30 C layer of the atmosphere was 800-1100 J/kg, but hail was limited by the high freezing level, 16,000 to 16,500 feet.  Quarter size hail fell in Calhoun County as an intense storm passed though.  The same storm cluster produced a funnel cloud in Sac County earlier.  Scattered winds occurred with the storms.  A 61 MPH wind gust was recorded in Eagle Grove for example and windows were blown out in Humboldt County south of Thor.  One of the thunderstorms produced a tornado in Emmet County.  The tornado touched down briefly over Lake Iowa.  Thunderstorms became more organized during the evening and produced very heavy rainfall.  In addition to the rainfall, scattered reports of high winds and some hail up to an inch and one quarter in size were received.  Most of the wind reports were around 60 MPH.  By far the most significant weather was the heavy rainfall.  Three to 5 inches of rain fell on saturated ground, resulting in a very widespread flash flood event.  Nearly half of the CWA was involved from parts of north central Iowa south to the Missouri border.  Numerous roads were covered with flowing water of 1 to 2 feet in depth.  Lightning struck a car at mile post 105 on Interstate 35 in Story County.  No injuries were reported.  Lightning also struck a house in Ankeny, causing a fire.  The flash flooding claimed one life in central Iowa.   Three vehicles were swept into the waters of Mud Creek near Altoona in Polk County.  There were 11 people involved.  A rescue call was made to save the occupants of the cars.  One 16 year old female perished in the flood waters, the other 10 were rescued, though 4 were injured and received treatment at a local hospital.  The flash flooding transitioned into widespread flooding as the night progressed into the day of the 11th.  Flash flooding resulted in evacuations of apartments and trailer courts on the east side of Des Moines.  Interstate 35 was covered by water due to flash flooding at mile post 97.  Several cars spun out in the flood waters.  Very intense rainfall in the Ames area resulted in a record crest on Squaw Creek.  The creek crested 1.5 to 2.5 feet above the record high stage.  Major flooding took place and the water treatment plant was inundated.  Major damage was done to several buildings on the Iowa State Campus.  Damage to Iowa State alone was between $40,000,000 and $50,000,000.  Flooding from the Skunk River closed U.S. Highway 30.  Thirty people were rescued at a Wal-Mart store in Ames as well.

During the afternoon, a persistent band of strong to severe thunderstorms developed and moved very slowly over south central and southeast Wisconsin through the evening hours. The individual storms were moving quite fast, about 40 to 50 mph, but the slow southward movement of the boundary these storms were developing along, resulted in storms repeatedly training, or moving, over the same area.||Widespread 3 to 4 inch amounts were reported along and either side of the I-94 corridor, with locally higher amounts of 5 to 8 inches.  The greatest rain amounts fell in Milwaukee County. Mitchell Field recorded 5.61 inches for the day, breaking a record for the date. The previous record was 1.26 set in 1948. This also is the second highest daily rainfall total on record for Milwaukee. The greatest one-day precipitation record was the 6.81 inches which fell on August 6, 1986. Madison also set a record for precipitation for the date at 3.62 inches. This beat the previous mark of 2.21 inches set in 1885. The 3.62 inches of rainfall ranks 13th for the most precipitation received in one day. The record is the 4.96 inches which fell on August 8, 1906. ||About 32,000 We Energy utility customers lost electrical power throughout southeast Wisconsin due to the flooding and lightning.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Thunderstorms training over the region produced flooding rains over all of Milwaukee County...causing massive flooding, shutting down streets and the freeway system at rush hour with up to 4 feet of rushing water.||There was one fatality - the body of a 19-year-old male was found in Lincoln Creek near N. 32nd St. and W.

Light to moderate rain continued through the 8th over much of the region and then became much heavier as the center of the storm moved from southwest Oklahoma into northeast Oklahoma late on the 8th and during the early morning hours of the 9th.  The heaviest rainfall totals occurred just east of the storm track.  ||Rainfall rates of over two inches per hour and rainfall totals of eight to fourteen inches across east central OK and northwest AR led to widespread flash flooding during the morning hours of the 9th. The heaviest swath of rain occurred across southern McIntosh, northern Pittsburg, southern Muskogee, Haskell, Sequoyah, and southern Adair Counties in eastern Oklahoma, and some of the worst flooding occurred in these areas. The following locations received in excess of seven inches of rain during the event, much of which fell during a several hour period during the early morning hours of the 9th: 13.42 inches in Whitefield in Haskell County, 11.25 inches in Stigler in Haskell County, 10.41 inches in Sallisaw in Sequoyah County, 10.35 inches in Eufaula in McIntosh County, 9.60 inches at R.S.

Businesses and residences in Sallisaw, Oklahoma were inundated by high water, forcing schools to close. Emergency officials performed numerous swift water rescues and many roads were closed due to the high water throughout the area. A 19-yr old male drowned on the morning of the 9th as he tried to drive through high water over a low water crossing seven miles south of Stilwell in Adair County, Oklahoma.  Several small bridges and low water crossings were washed out, especially in Muskogee and Sequoyah Counties.

The heaviest rains occurred between 900 AM and 300 PM Sunday in which up to 7 inches of rain was recorded. These heavy rains caused widespread street flooding and road closures in Aransas, San Patricio, Nueces, and Kleberg Counties.

Higher amounts of rain fell across Delaware county in the western Catskills, where 6 to 8 inches of rain caused more serious flood problems.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rain caused flooding of numerous roads throughout the county, including Rockland. A vehicle fatality occurred at about 5:00 AM on the morning of October 1st in the Town of Neversink. The driver was traveling to work and was swept by floodwaters into Willowemoc Creek. The body of the 55 year old woman was found the next morning along the shore of the Neversink Reservoir.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Although no lives were lost there, cabins were destroyed along with additional vehicles, RVs, and camping trailers.||Aside from the flooding produced by the Little Missouri River, most of the creeks in the area overflowed their banks. Trees and other vegetation that had been mowed down by the swift water could be seen at a number of locations along Arkansas Highway 369. In addition, small rockslides occurred on several of the hills adjacent to the highway.||Flash flooding also occurred on the Caddo River around Caddo Gap. A cabin and canoe rental business had several cabins flooded, along with the office/bunkhouse building. One swift-water rescue of campers was necessary.

Numerous homes and cars were flooded. One person died, and at least 136 people were injured. Damage was estimated at $5.5 million in Oklahoma county alone.||The event began late on June 13th, as thunderstorms developed over northwest Oklahoma. The thunderstorms developed ahead of a slow moving cold front that was located over southwest Kansas into the northern Texas panhandle. A large outflow boundary also extended eastward. The thunderstorms became more numerous as they moved along the outflow boundary.  Strengthened by the new rainfall, the outflow boundary dropped toward central Oklahoma, and a very moist low-level jet resulted in new thunderstorm development near the boundary.||The first round of significant rain impacted central Oklahoma around 3 am. This round moved east before another, longer lived, thunderstorm complex developed over the Oklahoma City metro area. The outflow boundary was located south of Interstate 40, and the low-level jet transported warm and unseasonably humid air north of the boundary, creating very heavy rain. Thunderstorms continued to develop over the southwest metro area, and slowly moved northeast. Rainfall rates averaged one to two inches per hour, with some thunderstorm bands producing rates near three inches per hour.||The heavy rain accumulated quickly immediately before and during the busy morning drive time. Numerous cars became stranded in the rapidly rising water. Roadways were covered by rapidly flowing water, and ponds, creeks, and rivers easily spilled over their banks. Navigating in and around the metro area became almost impossible, and many motorists had to be rescued by boat. After several hours, the persistent heavy rainfall tapered off around noon.||The larger area of heavy rainfall moved south as the outflow boundary moved into southern Oklahoma. Significant rain developed over southwest Oklahoma by early afternoon, and flash flooding once again became a problem. Lawton was hard hit, receiving between four and five inches of rain, resulting in several roadways becoming flooded. Numerous motorists had to be rescued from the high water. One motorist, unfortunately, lost his life when his vehicle stalled in flood waters.||Thunderstorms developed again over central Oklahoma late in the afternoon and evening, but luckily the duration of the thunderstorms was relatively short. By the time it was all said and done, widespread totals of five to nine inches were reported over much of Oklahoma City. Will Rogers World Airport reported its largest daily precipitation since records began in 1891, with 7.62 inches. Even higher totals were reported over the north-central portion of Oklahoma City, where nine to twelve inches was measured.||Strong winds caused some power outages during the event. At the peak of the event, over 6700 people were without power. Isolated pockets of wind damage did occur, with a power pole/power lines downed south of Drummond in Garfield county.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Another round of heavy rain occurred over parts of the Oklahoma City metro area. The heavy rain falling on already saturated ground quickly led to flash flooding. Several roadways had to be re-barricaded due to very high water. The water that had receded around some residences began to rise again. After the rain ended, some areas had received over a foot of rainfall for the day. Much of it fell in only a few hours. Total damages for the day were over $5 million. One hundred twenty-two homes were affected, 52 of those home receiving minor damage, 11 receiving major damage, and one home was completely destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

About 100,000 people were evacuated from the Atlantic Coast. Numerous roadways were flooded and closed and thousands of trees were knocked down. About 100,000 utility customers lost power. In addition, chickens were killed by flooding and agricultural crops were damaged by the flooding. Delaware received federal disaster declaration.  ||Tropical storm force wind gusts overspread Delaware during the afternoon of the 27th and persisted through the afternoon of the 28th. Peak wind gusts averaged around 60 mph. The strongest winds associated with Irene occurred at two distinct times. The first surge occurred during bands of heavier rain during the evening of the 27th. The second peak occurred during the late morning and early afternoon of the 28th when skies were clearing and deeper mixing of the atmosphere brought stronger winds to the ground. The rain associated with Irene overspread the state between 7 a.m. EDT and Noon EDT on the 27th, fell at its heaviest from the late afternoon of the 27th into the early morning of the 28th and ended around Noon EDT on the 28th. Event precipitation totals averaged 5 to 12 inches and caused widespread and in some instances record breaking flooding. Because the flash flooding and flooding blended into one, all stormdata flooding related county entries were combined into one under flood events. The storm surge of 3 to 4 feet caused minor to moderate tidal flooding along tidal sections of the Delaware River and in Upper Delaware Bay and moderate to severe tidal flooding along lower Delaware Bay and along the coast during the evening high tide cycle on the 27th. The winds shifted to the northwest during the morning high tide cycle on the 28th.  ||Governor Jack Markell ordered visitors to evacuate the Delaware beaches effective 6 pm EDT on August 25th. In addition, a state of emergency was declared and shelters were opened throughout the state on August 26th. Driving restrictions were in place. Mandatory evacuations of approximately one hundred thousand tourists and residents occurred, including special populations, began on Thursday, August 25th. The Cape May���Lewes Ferry suspended service for August 27th and 28th. Toll operations on Delaware State Route 1 were halted. Transit services were shut down on August 27th and 28th, while most of the bridges over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and the Indian River were closed due to the wind.||About 100,000 utility customers lost power at the peak of the storm. Power was not fully restored until August 31st. Schools were dismissed early on Friday the 26th and remained closed through the duration of the event. The state highway department reported over two hundred roads under water. Seven bridges sustained structural damage. At least thirty-seven homes and businesses sustained major damage or were destroyed. Extensive damage occurred to the six state maintained beaches as severe beach erosion and dune breaches occurred. The combination of heavy rain and severe tidal flooding washed out Prime Hook Road along Delaware Bay in Cedar Creek Hundred (Sussex County). In Kent County, tidal flooding occurred along Kitts Hummock Road as well as along Bowers Beach. | |The highest wind gusts recorded during Hurricane Irene were 66 mph in Lewes (Sussex County), 64 mph in Dewey Beach (Sussex County), 60 mph in Georgetown (Sussex County), 57 mph in Wilmington (New Castle County), and 52 mph in Dover (Kent County). The highest tides included 8.20 feet above mean lower low water at Breakwater Harbor in Sussex County (severe flooding starts at 8.0 feet above mean lower low water) and 8.03 feet above mean lower low water at Reedy Island in New Castle County. Minor tidal flooding at Reedy starts at 7.2 feet above mean lower low water.||Hurricane Irene formed east of the Leeward Islands on Saturday the 20th. It moved northeast and passed over Puerto Rico overnight on the 21st. As Irene moved off the island, it intensified into a hurricane. Irene just bypassed the island of Hispaniola to its north and then passed over the Eastern Bahamas on the 25th as it reached category three hurricane strength. From the Bahamas, Irene moved nearly due north and slowly weakened to a category two hurricane on the 26th and a category one hurricane on the 27th. Irene made her initial landfall near Cape Lookout, North Carolina at 8 a.m. EDT on the 27th and then proceeded to the northnortheast and went back over the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia and North Carolina border at 7 p.m. EDT on the 27th. Irene then paralleled the Delmarva Peninsula and the center passed about 15 miles east of Delaware between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. EDT on the 28th.

For most of this time the wave was nearly surrounded by dry air and with enough vertical wind shear to ensure that any intensification would be slow. Its forward speed of 20 mph somewhat aided the shear in keeping it weak. Irene made landfall over mainland Puerto Rico at 125 am AST on August 22, near Punta Santiago then Luis Munoz Marin International Airport at San Juan recorded its highest wind gust of 59 mph at 218 am AST.  At 300 am AST (0700 UTC) the center was estimated to be 10 miles southwest of San Juan with 70 mph sustained winds, mainly over the Atlantic waters north of the city.||By 500 am AST doppler radar had indicated winds sustained up to 72 knots (83 mph) only 500 to 600 feet above the water. Irene was then officially upgraded to a hurricane though a hurricane warning had already been issued for the region. With the hurricane center moving offshore about this time the strongest winds (north of the center) also moved away from shore. At 536 am AST the buoy near Arecibo recorded its highest wind gust of 37 knots (43 mph). At 900 am AST the center of Irene was directly north of the west coast of Puerto Rico but the hurricane force winds were well offshore with an obviously developing eye on radar.||Puerto Rico was under the effects of Tropical Cyclone Irene from early Sunday August 22 through late Wednesday August 24. Irene made landfall as a tropical storm during the early morning hours of Monday August 22, intensified overland and became a hurricane over northern Puerto Rico around 500 am Monday, before exiting into the Atlantic later that morning. Irene���s most siginificant impact was the heavy rainfall. The first rainbands entered eastern Puerto Rico early on Sunday and persisted through midnight on Wednesday, although additional rainfall was received across some of the east municipalities through Thursday morning August 25. Locations like Gurabo across eastern interior Puerto Rico experienced significant 48 hour rainfall accumulations, with an estimated return period of around 50 years.||Shortly after Irene���s center passed by San Juan on August 22 there were 800,000 homes without electric power and 118,000 without water service. The storm surge from Irene, as expected, was very minor. The highest surges measured were at Esperanza (Vieques) and Fajardo and reached 1.6 feet between 100 am and 200 am (0506z and 0530z respectively). This was during the time that the center of Irene was moving inland over Eastern Puerto Rico.||Damage from flooding was extensive across the region from Irene, however, though wind caused widespread damage it was relatively minor compared to a more significant hurricane. Numerous trees were blown down very early on Monday morning from Fajardo to San Juan Metro. Downed trees were reported to block highways in Gurabo, Adjuntas, Caguas while a down power pole lay on Highway PR-176 in Cupey.||On August 27 Puerto Rico had been declared a major disaster area, and by September 3 additional municipalities were added to provide aid to those impacted, and still more on September 13. In all, there were 29 municipalities approved for individual assistance to individuals and households while 37 municipalities were designated for public assistance to state and local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations for emergency work and the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 62 year old woman in her vehicle was overtaken by flood waters as she attempted to drive across a flooded roadway PR-857 in Barrio Canovanillas, Cohitre sector. The women was rescued by citizens and taken to a local hospital where she later died.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Event precipitation totals averaged 4 to 9 inches, except in Berks County where 6 to 12 inches fell.  One drowning occurred in Philadelphia. The heavy rain caused widespread poor drainage flooding as well as moderate flooding along the Delaware and Schuylkill Basins and minor to moderate flooding along the Lehigh River Basin. Crests in the upper Schuylkill, Lehigh and Delaware River Basins were higher than what occurred with Irene the previous month and the highest crests since late June of 2006 in most instances. The crests along the Delaware River were 2 to 4 feet higher than what occurred during Irene. Some of the smaller streams in southeastern Pennsylvania reached major flooding levels, but most of those crests were lower than what occurred with Irene. In addition to the freshwater flooding, moderate tidal flooding occurred along the lower Delaware River and its tributaries. ||In the most recent available flooding assessment for Eastern Pennsylvania, there were 22 homes and businesses that were destroyed, 201 that suffered major damage, 672 that had minor damage and 1217 others that were affected. The preliminary damage estimate for the state of Pennsylvania was five hundred million dollars.  Please look for possible updates in future monthly issues of stormdata.| |The combination of fresh water runoff and a weak southerly flow produced moderate tidal flooding during the evening high tide cycles from the 7th through the 9th and minor tidal flooding with all of the other high tide cycles from the evening of the 6th through overnight on the 11th. The highest tides occurred during the evening high tide cycle on the 8th in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties and the evening high tide cycle on the 9th in Bucks County.  The evening high tide on the 8th in Philadelphia reached 9.41 feet above mean lower low water. Moderate tidal flooding starts at 9.2 feet above mean lower low water. The high tide in Newbold Island (Bucks County) reached 12.11 feet above mean lower low water. There is no current categorical tide gage information for this site.  ||Tropical Storm Lee made landfall in Louisiana during the morning of the 4th and moved slowly northeast. An approaching cold front from the Mississippi Valley reached Lee by the morning of the 5th and transformed it to an extratropical system on the 5th in Mississippi. The same cold front acted as a conduit for Lee's moisture farther to the northeast. Showers and thunderstorms from that approaching cold front arrived during the evening and overnight on the 5th  and set off the first round of flash flooding rains in Northeast Pennsylvania. The front then stalled just south of Delmarva on the 6th. A relative lull in the rain then occurred during the morning of the 6th. As the front started to back north as a warm front later in the day on the 6th, more bands of heavier rain returned that afternoon and particularly that evening. A blocking weather pattern then moved the frontal boundary little from the morning of the 7th into the morning of the 8th across southeast Pennsylvania. A couple of bands of flash flood producing rains started to form and move east into Eastern Pennsylvania during the late afternoon and evening of the 7th and continued through the night.  The frontal boundary started to drift offshore later in the day on the 8th and most of the precipitation associated with Lee was done.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A band of showers and thunderstorms with heavy rain caused flash flooding of smaller streams as well as poor drainage flooding in Philadelphia. It also caused the drowning death of a 27-year-old woman who was caught in flood waters in the East Germantown section of the city.  She was discovered in the rear of her Sports Utility Vehicle at the intersection of Musgrave and Haines Streets on the morning of the 8th.  The Wingohocking Creek, which is a creek that was buried underground during the 19th century had its waters back out of sewer grates and manhole covers in that section of the city.  Godfrey Avenue and Wister Street also flooded in East Germantown. The wall of a church also collapsed.

Meanwhile, a dry slot formed ahead of this feature allowing for increased instability over the mountains and foothills and promoting the development of discrete supercell storms. The storms evolved into a quasi-linear convective system as they moved east across central and southside Virginia. The storms displayed considerable rotation on radar and over a half dozen tornado warnings were issued although no tornadoes were reported. The hail reports from this event were prolific with numerous reports of quarter to golfball size and some almost as big as baseballs. Other reports were of  pea to marble size hail covering the ground to depths of 4 to 6 inches. Rainfall amounts of 1 to 3 inches were also common with local amounts of 3 to 5 inches causing flash flooding. There was flood fatality in Buckingham County where the driver tried to cross a low-water crossing at a flooded stream and the vehicle was carried downstream. The excessive runoff also resulted in minor river flooding along parts of the lower Roanoke and Dan Rivers. The USGS gauge on the Falling River near Naruna in Campbell County rose almost 10 feet in 6 hours, cresting at 14.42 feet (Flood Stage - 11') early on the 25th. 48-hour rain gauge totals ending 8 AM EDT on March 25th included 4.23 at Raven Rock Church IFLOWS (Patrick County), 4.13 at Ferrum IFLOWS (Franklin Co.), 3.95 at Slate Mtn, IFLOWS (Floyd Co.) and 3.51 at Doe Run Church IFLOWS (Patrick Co.).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rainfall of 2 to 4 inches in several hours caused several small streams to flood including Greasy Creek southwest of Buckingham. After the flooding receded, the County Sheriff's Office said deputies found a deceased 61-year-old woman inside a pickup truck several days after she was reported missing. The truck was found on its side and wedged against a tree, about 300 yards from a dirt driveway that crossed Grease Creek. The sheriff's office said a preliminary investigation indicated that flood waters disabled the truck and carried it downstream when the driver tried to drive across the flooded low-water crossing.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Flood waters then poured into the home, located at 40715 North Erickson Lane, causing severe flood damage. As the wall collapsed, the flood waters slammed into the homeonwner, carrying her across the yard and causing injuries to her.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A Flash Flood Warning was issued for Wickenburg at about 5 pm in the afternoon. According to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Department, a 65 year old man died as he attempted to drive across the Hassayampa wash/river near Wickenburg. As he attempted to drive through the wash, the swiftly flowing water carried his vehicle about one quarter of a mile downstream and into some brush, causing him to drown. No other details were made available. In addition to the fatality, crews were dispatched to four water rescues during the evening hours on Saturday according to Kevin Pool of the Wickenburg Fire Department.  One such rescue occurred north of town along US highway 93 in a neighborhood near a wash. In that incident the person was rescued from the top of his vehicle by sheriff's helicopter and taken to a hospital for observation.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

There was record rainfall in the San Antonio area with the San Antonio International Airport recording 9.87 inches of rain (2nd highest 24 hr total on record) and CoCoRAHS observers reporting over 11 inches.  Most of the rain fell in about six hours with four inches in one hour between 6 and 7 AM. A USGS stream and rain gauge on Olmos Creek and Dresden Drive reported 2.58 inches in 15 min between 615 and 630 am.  The gauge reported 6.13 inches in one hour, 9.46 inches in 2 hours, and totaled 15.31 inches in 5 hours.  A 24hr total at this gauge was 17 inches of rain.  This led to massive flooding in the Olmos Basin/Creek just inside Loop 410 near the Quarry.  Most of the flooding across the city was in north central and northwest San Antonio along and just side Loop 410. This rain came a day after another heavy rain event with parts of the city receiving over two inches. This all led to major flooding with Olmos Creek, the Medina River, Leon Creek, the San Antonio River, and Salado Creek all reaching major flood stage. There were many roads closed including Hwy 281 at Olmos Creek which remained closed for several days. At 10 AM, there was a foot of water over Ingram and Callaghan Rds. San Antonio creeks and streams saw big rises in their levels which led to additional flooding down steam in the south portion of Bexar County.  Areas that were hit the hardest included the Espada Road area near the San Antonio River and Loop 410 intersection.  A mobile home park on Plumnear Road off Leon Creek on the southwest side of the city was flooded out.  Several hundred rescues and calls for rescue occurred during the morning of the 25th.  Two fatalities occurred inside Bexar County. A woman was killed when her car was swept away in flood waters along Leon Creek at the 5800 Block of U.S Highway 90.  Another woman was killed in her car when her car was swept away in the 400 Block of Rhapsody Drive about 730 am.  In all the City of San Antonio and Bexar County Emergency Management agencies found over 350 impacted residences with 15 of those being destroyed and 27 suffering major damage.  The other residences suffered minor damages.  Most of the destroyed residences were in the Espada area along the San Antonio River in southeast Bexar County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This made the region susceptible to additional flooding.||An unusually strong area of low pressure for late June moved from central Pennsylvania northeastward across eastern New York during the early morning hours of Friday, June 28th.   This storm system was more typical of a winter-like storm, due to deep low pressure and heavy precipitation spiraling around the western side of the storm system.  A strong southerly flow ahead of this system transported very moist air into the region.||Heavy rainfall moved across the Mohawk Valley and western Adirondacks in advance of the low pressure during the early morning hours. The rain fell heaviest during the late night hours before tapering off during the late morning.  Rainfall fell at rates of nearly one inch per hour at times with three to five inches of rainfall having occurred in total. This led to significant flash flooding across both the Mohawk Valley and Adirondacks. ||Many roads were washed out and closed, including a portion of the New York State Thruway between exits 29 (Canajoharie) and 29A (Little Falls).  In addition, urbanized areas along the Mohawk River experienced dangerous amounts of flooding.  The entire town of Fort Plain was under water and many swift water rescues had to take place.  Many homes and trailers were impacted by flood waters.  The New York State Barge Canal was closed as a result of the flooding.  In addition, one fatality occurred as a result of the flooding. ||State of emergencies were declared in many communities as a result of the flooding including:  Herkimer County, Montgomery County, Village of Ilion (Herkimer County),  Town and Village of Herkimer (Herkimer County), Village of Mohawk (Herkimer County), Town of Johnsburg (Warren County), Town of Minden (Montgomery County), and the Town of German Flatts (Herkimer County). | |On July 12th, President Obama signed a New York Disaster Declaration and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area affected by severe storms and flooding during the period of June 28 to July 4, 2013.

Tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, and flash flooding occurred. The flooding killed six people, and the tornadoes killed one. The same weather system caused severe storms and flash flooding again on June 1st. For the 24-hour period ending at 7 AM on the 31st, a band of very heavy rain fell from Waldron and Mena to Conway and Little Rock and then on to Newport and Augusta. Within this band, rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches were common, and isolated totals exceeded 7 inches. Also on the evening of the 30th, 3.09 inches of rain fell in one hour at Little Rock, breaking the all-time record for the greatest amount of rain in one hour in the city. The previous record was 3.00 inches on May 26, 1955. President Barack Obama declared federal disasters in these counties:  Cleburne, Independence, Montgomery, Polk, Scott, Searcy, Stone, Van Buren, and Woodruff.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Severe flash flooding occurred across a large part of Scott County. Soon after Midnight CDT on the 31st, two women called 911 after flooding from Mill Creek trapped them in their house at Y City. The Scott County Sheriff and a Wildlife Officer First Class from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission responded to the call. According to the incident report by the Game and Fish Commission, the rescuers reached the house in an aluminum motorboat, removed one woman from the house and put here in their boat. As they were trying to rescue the second woman, the house collapsed due to the force of the floodwaters. The boat then capsized, drowning the three people in the boat, and the woman in the house also drowned. (The sheriff was a 41 year-old male, the wildlife officer was a 32 year-old male, and the women in the house were females 60 and 65 years old.) It took until June 2nd to recover the bodies of all the victims. Recovery operations were greatly hampered by another round of heavy rain and flooding on the morning of June 1st. Altogether, about 20 people had to be rescued from the flood waters. U.S. 71, the main north-south route through western Arkansas, flooded at Y City. The flooding caused a car to be washed off the highway and a 42 year-old woman in the car drowned. Her husband survived, but had to cling to the bank of a stream for 6 hours before being rescued. Several other cars were washed off roads, as well, but the motorists survived. Arkansas 28 was washed out at Little Cedar Creek (10 miles east of Y City), Big Cedar Creek (12 miles east of Y City), and the Fourche LaFave River (16.5 miles east of Y City). Numerous county roads and bridges were washed out. For the 24-hour period ending at 7 AM on the 31st, Parks measured 7.78 inches of rain and Waldron picked up 5.26 inches. Houses were flooded at a number of places, including Y City, Boles, and Parks. The American Red Cross indicated 7 houses and 15 mobile homes were destroyed, 9 houses and 4 mobile home had major damage, 13 houses and 3 mobile homes had minor damage, and 14 houses and 8 mobile homes were affected. A fiber optic cable was knocked out of service. As a result, there was no landline phone service, cell phone service, or internet service to most of the county for about 24 hours from the 30th into the 31st.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 9.20M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In addition, a weak stationary front stretched along the Front Range Foothills and Palmer Divide.  As a result, a prolonged period of moderate to heavy rain developed across the Front Range Foothills, Palmer Divide, Urban Corridor.  By the 14th, storm totals ranged from 6 to 18 inches, highest in the foothills of Boulder County.  The headwaters then moved down the South Platte River and caused widespread flooding with record flood stages at several locations as it made its way downstream into Nebraska.  Record high flood stages along the South Platte River were recorded at Balzac, Weldona and Julesburg.  As a result, widespread flooding occur along the South Platte for several days as the headwaters continued downstream, with much of the damage reported from Fort Morgan and Brush to around Sterling.  The floodwaters resulted in widespread evacuations.  Numerous water treatment facilities were contaminated and had to be shut down.  The headwaters remained at or above flood stage east of Sterling to Julesburg, but the flooding was not as widespread and the damage not as extensive. ||Initially, the showers that developed on the afternoon of the 11th were moving fast enough and were small enough to produce generally moderate rainfall amounts.   However, rain along the Front Range began to intensify and become more widespread in the evening. A narrow band of very heavy rain began to organize just north of Denver and move westward toward the foothills.  By 9 pm mdt on the 11th, heavy rain was becoming more widespread, with rainfall rates near 2 inches per hour in the heaviest showers.  From 10 pm mdt to Midnight mdt, very heavy rain locked itself in against the Front Range.  Flash flooding became more widespread, with several road closures from northwest Jefferson County northward through Boulder and Larimer Counties.  The heaviest rain in the foothills of Boulder, Larimer and northern Jefferson Counties finally began to abate, but widespread flash flooding continued due to the extremely heavy rainfall during the evening and early morning hours of the 12th.  Meanwhile, torrential rain redeveloped in southwest Weld, northeast Adams, eastern Denver and northwest Arapahoe Counties in the early morning hours of the 12th;  which impacted northeast Denver and Aurora.  ||Atypical for September in Colorado, 24-hour rainfall totals ending 7 am mdt on September 12th included 6.5 to 8.6 inches in Boulder; with 3 to 6.5 inches across the Larimer and Boulder County foothills, as well an area stretching from northeastern Metro Denver area into southwest Weld County.  By 9 am mdt, heavy rain and considerable flash flooding continued through the morning in the Aurora area.   Numerous streams remained at or above bankfull levels across Boulder, Larimer, and southwest Weld counties.  By the evening of the 12th, flooding continued in many areas and increased in severity. Heavy rain, while not as widespread as the previous day, had a greater impact on stream levels as streams were already elevated and the ground was completely saturated. Two peaks of flows occurred on Boulder Creek near downtown. The peak flow on the evening of September 12th surpassed the 1969 Boulder flood, but initial indications are that it fell short of the 1938 and 1894 floods.  Boulder Stream Gauge ���peak flows occurred near 0100 mdt on the 12th, and 2100 mdt on the 12th.   Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Big Thompson River,  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  The headwaters moved down the South Platte with floodwaters impacted Weld, Morgan, Washington and Logan Counties.  Extensive flooding occurred in and around Greeley, Fort Morgan and Sterling.  Large sections of the counties' roads and highways were washed away, with property and crops completely inundated.   ||After little rainfall on Friday, September 13th, the flash flood threat returned for  Saturday. This time, storms with heavy rainfall were concentrated in Douglas County, but also extended northeast into the Aurora area once again. Up to 3 inches of rain fell in one hour.  Plum Creek and other small creeks and streams flooded, along with significant street flooding.  The last day of this prolonged period of very heavy rainfall was on Sunday, September 15th. Another weak front had pushed through the area Saturday night, leaving the atmosphere unseasonably moist and unstable.  Heavy rain developed by mid morning and then became more widespread and peaked in intensity by the noon hour. This time, flash flooding was most significant in the northern portions of the Denver metro area from Northglenn to around Broomfield. Rain finally tapered off during the late afternoon and evening.||The devastating flood damage encompassed 4,500 square miles of the Colorado Front Range, left seven dead, forced thousands to evacuate, and destroyed thousands of homes and farms. Record amounts of rainfall generated flash floods that tore up roads and lines of communication, leaving many stranded.  Nearly 19,000 homes were damaged, and over 1,500 destroyed.  The Colorado Department of Transportation estimated that at least 30 state highway bridges were destroyed and an additional 20 seriously damaged. A preliminary assessment of the state's infrastructure showed damage of $40 million to roads and $112 million to bridges.  Repair costs for state and and county roads were likely to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Miles of freight and passenger rail lines were washed out or submerged, including a section servicing Amtrak's iconic California Zephyr.  The town of Lyons in Boulder County was isolated by the flooding of St. Vrain Creek, and several earth dams along the Front Range burst or were over-topped.   Floodwaters also swept through Estes Park, the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park and a major tourist attraction, and damaged hundreds of buildings and destroyed large sections of the two main roads that led into town; U.S. 34 from Loveland and U.S. 36 from Lyons/Boulder.  U.S. 34 suffered the most damage, with 85 percent of its roadway and bridges destroyed.   In Weld County, approximately 1,900 gas wells were damaged and had to be closed off as the floodwaters inundated entire communities. ||Sewage treatment plants and other utilities were knocked out in a number of towns,  and standing water left by floods on prairie farmlands posed the threat of significant damage to crops already planted in the region.  Northeast Colorado Health Department has advised with the local CSU Extension office in Logan County regarding local crops and gardens that had been exposed to flood waters.  As the flood waters in our area should be considered contaminated, local crops and gardens may not be considered suitable for human consumption or animal feed.  In the flooded areas, an estimated 23,000 acres of cropland was impacted and stretched from Boulder to Logan Counties and included:  alfalfa, corn, hay, silage and sugar beets.  The estimated loss of production ranged from $3.4 million to $5.5 million. ||Governor Hickenlooper declared a disaster emergency on September 13th, in 11 counties across northeast Colorado including:  Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Boulder, Denver, Jefferson, Larimer, Logan, Morgan, Washington and Weld.  By September 15th, federal emergency declarations covered those counties as well as Clear Creek County.  Projected losses from the flooding statewide was nearly $3 billion in property damage.  Half of the damage estimate was from housing and half from the commercial and government sectors, according to Eqecat, a catastrophe modeling firm; this was the first comprehensive estimate of the disaster's economic toll.  The projected losses for residential property alone were about $900 million.  Another $1 billion was attributed to commercial and goverment property, including roads and bridges.  In addition, more than 11 thousand people were evacuated, reportedly the largest since Hurricane Katrina.  President Obama declared a state of emergency for Boulder and Larimer Counties, with an additional 10 counties added September 16th including: Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Clear Creek, Denver, Jefferson, Morgan, Logan, Washington and Weld Counties.  The president also declared a major disaster specifically for Boulder County, which provided for federal recovery assistance. ||There were six fatalities directly attributed to flash flooding.  By county, those fatalities included 4 in Boulder County and 2 in Larimer County.  Two 19-yr old teenagers died on the evening of the 11th, after they were swept away by floodwaters after abandoning their vehicle on Lindon Drive in Boulder.  In Jamestown, a 72-yr old man was killed when the building he was in collapsed.  An 80-yr old Lyons resident was killed in the early morning hours of the 12th, when his truck was swept into the St. Vrain River near his home.   On the evening of the 12th, a 79-yr old Larimer County resident was killed when she was swept away while trying to climb to safety from her home in Cedar Point.   A 61-yr old Cedar Point resident died when her home was swept down the Big Thompson River by the floodwaters.  An indirect fatality occurred on the 16th.  An 80-yr old Idaho Springs resident drowned in Clear Creek when the embankment he was standing on collapsed.||Along the South Platte River, the crest of the flood at Kersey was near 18.8 feet on September 14th, which was significantly higher than the record crest of 11.73 feet set on May 8, 1973.   On September 15th, the flood crest was near 13.7 feet at Balzac which exceeded the record of 13.3 feet set on June 18, 1965.  On September 18th, the flood crest was at Julesburg was 10.6 feet, which broke the previous record of 10.44 feet set on June 20, 1965.  ||In Boulder, some of the monthly records broken included:  one-day all-time record:  9.08 inches which shattered the previous wettest day of 4.8 inches set on July 31, 1919; one-month record of 18.16 inches, which broke the previous all-time monthly record of 9.59 inches set in May of 1995; wettest September on record which broke the previous record of 5.5 inches set in September of 1940; one-year record of 34.15 inches broke the previous wettest year of 29.93 inches set in 1995.  In Denver, the total precipitation for the month of September was 5.61 inches, which was 4.65 inches above the normal of 0.96 inches. This is the most precipitation ever recorded in Denver for the month of September.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> In Boulder, Old Tale Road at McSorley was closed due to debris and downed trees.  Debris forced the partial closure of 3rd Street and Canyon and the Eastbound lane of Baseline Road near Foothills Parkway.  Flooding was also reported at:  9th and Alpine,   9th and Balsam and South Boulder Road at Manhatten Street.  Two teenagers in Boulder were killed when they abandoned their vehicle while trying to flee the floodwaters.  The two other occupants suffered minor injuries; one escaped the vehicle while the other remained in the car and was later rescued.  In the city of Boulder, 61 properties were destroyed.||In the Fourmile burn area, widespread flash flooding and debris flows forced the closure of Fourmile Canyon at Boulder Canyon.  Water was also reportedly flowing over Gold Run Road at Ingram Gulch due to a blocked culvert.  Major structural damage occurred in Fourmile Canyon and Jamestown, which forced a mandatory evacuation of all residents.  A man in Jamestown was killed when the building he was in collapsed.  In the Jamestown area, 26 properties were destroyed.  Flash flooding was also reported in Lefthand Canyon. In unincorporated Boulder County, a total of 86 properties were destroyed.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In addition, a weak stationary front stretched along the Front Range Foothills and Palmer Divide.  As a result, a prolonged period of moderate to heavy rain developed across the Front Range Foothills, Palmer Divide, Urban Corridor.  By the 14th, storm totals ranged from 6 to 18 inches, highest in the foothills of Boulder County.  The headwaters then moved down the South Platte River and caused widespread flooding with record flood stages at several locations as it made its way downstream into Nebraska.  Record high flood stages along the South Platte River were recorded at Balzac, Weldona and Julesburg.  As a result, widespread flooding occur along the South Platte for several days as the headwaters continued downstream, with much of the damage reported from Fort Morgan and Brush to around Sterling.  The floodwaters resulted in widespread evacuations.  Numerous water treatment facilities were contaminated and had to be shut down.  The headwaters remained at or above flood stage east of Sterling to Julesburg, but the flooding was not as widespread and the damage not as extensive. ||Initially, the showers that developed on the afternoon of the 11th were moving fast enough and were small enough to produce generally moderate rainfall amounts.   However, rain along the Front Range began to intensify and become more widespread in the evening. A narrow band of very heavy rain began to organize just north of Denver and move westward toward the foothills.  By 9 pm mdt on the 11th, heavy rain was becoming more widespread, with rainfall rates near 2 inches per hour in the heaviest showers.  From 10 pm mdt to Midnight mdt, very heavy rain locked itself in against the Front Range.  Flash flooding became more widespread, with several road closures from northwest Jefferson County northward through Boulder and Larimer Counties.  The heaviest rain in the foothills of Boulder, Larimer and northern Jefferson Counties finally began to abate, but widespread flash flooding continued due to the extremely heavy rainfall during the evening and early morning hours of the 12th.  Meanwhile, torrential rain redeveloped in southwest Weld, northeast Adams, eastern Denver and northwest Arapahoe Counties in the early morning hours of the 12th;  which impacted northeast Denver and Aurora.  ||Atypical for September in Colorado, 24-hour rainfall totals ending 7 am mdt on September 12th included 6.5 to 8.6 inches in Boulder; with 3 to 6.5 inches across the Larimer and Boulder County foothills, as well an area stretching from northeastern Metro Denver area into southwest Weld County.  By 9 am mdt, heavy rain and considerable flash flooding continued through the morning in the Aurora area.   Numerous streams remained at or above bankfull levels across Boulder, Larimer, and southwest Weld counties.  By the evening of the 12th, flooding continued in many areas and increased in severity. Heavy rain, while not as widespread as the previous day, had a greater impact on stream levels as streams were already elevated and the ground was completely saturated. Two peaks of flows occurred on Boulder Creek near downtown. The peak flow on the evening of September 12th surpassed the 1969 Boulder flood, but initial indications are that it fell short of the 1938 and 1894 floods.  Boulder Stream Gauge ���peak flows occurred near 0100 mdt on the 12th, and 2100 mdt on the 12th.   Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Big Thompson River,  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  Similar massive stream flows occurred on many other creeks and rivers up and down the Front Range, including:  Lefthand Creek, Little Thompson,  Cache la Poudre,  St Vrain Creek, Coal Creek, South Boulder Creek and Sand Creek.  The headwaters moved down the South Platte with floodwaters impacted Weld, Morgan, Washington and Logan Counties.  Extensive flooding occurred in and around Greeley, Fort Morgan and Sterling.  Large sections of the counties' roads and highways were washed away, with property and crops completely inundated.   ||After little rainfall on Friday, September 13th, the flash flood threat returned for  Saturday. This time, storms with heavy rainfall were concentrated in Douglas County, but also extended northeast into the Aurora area once again. Up to 3 inches of rain fell in one hour.  Plum Creek and other small creeks and streams flooded, along with significant street flooding.  The last day of this prolonged period of very heavy rainfall was on Sunday, September 15th. Another weak front had pushed through the area Saturday night, leaving the atmosphere unseasonably moist and unstable.  Heavy rain developed by mid morning and then became more widespread and peaked in intensity by the noon hour. This time, flash flooding was most significant in the northern portions of the Denver metro area from Northglenn to around Broomfield. Rain finally tapered off during the late afternoon and evening.||The devastating flood damage encompassed 4,500 square miles of the Colorado Front Range, left seven dead, forced thousands to evacuate, and destroyed thousands of homes and farms. Record amounts of rainfall generated flash floods that tore up roads and lines of communication, leaving many stranded.  Nearly 19,000 homes were damaged, and over 1,500 destroyed.  The Colorado Department of Transportation estimated that at least 30 state highway bridges were destroyed and an additional 20 seriously damaged. A preliminary assessment of the state's infrastructure showed damage of $40 million to roads and $112 million to bridges.  Repair costs for state and and county roads were likely to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Miles of freight and passenger rail lines were washed out or submerged, including a section servicing Amtrak's iconic California Zephyr.  The town of Lyons in Boulder County was isolated by the flooding of St. Vrain Creek, and several earth dams along the Front Range burst or were over-topped.   Floodwaters also swept through Estes Park, the gateway to Rocky Mountain National Park and a major tourist attraction, and damaged hundreds of buildings and destroyed large sections of the two main roads that led into town; U.S. 34 from Loveland and U.S. 36 from Lyons/Boulder.  U.S. 34 suffered the most damage, with 85 percent of its roadway and bridges destroyed.   In Weld County, approximately 1,900 gas wells were damaged and had to be closed off as the floodwaters inundated entire communities. ||Sewage treatment plants and other utilities were knocked out in a number of towns,  and standing water left by floods on prairie farmlands posed the threat of significant damage to crops already planted in the region.  Northeast Colorado Health Department has advised with the local CSU Extension office in Logan County regarding local crops and gardens that had been exposed to flood waters.  As the flood waters in our area should be considered contaminated, local crops and gardens may not be considered suitable for human consumption or animal feed.  In the flooded areas, an estimated 23,000 acres of cropland was impacted and stretched from Boulder to Logan Counties and included:  alfalfa, corn, hay, silage and sugar beets.  The estimated loss of production ranged from $3.4 million to $5.5 million. ||Governor Hickenlooper declared a disaster emergency on September 13th, in 11 counties across northeast Colorado including:  Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Boulder, Denver, Jefferson, Larimer, Logan, Morgan, Washington and Weld.  By September 15th, federal emergency declarations covered those counties as well as Clear Creek County.  Projected losses from the flooding statewide was nearly $3 billion in property damage.  Half of the damage estimate was from housing and half from the commercial and government sectors, according to Eqecat, a catastrophe modeling firm; this was the first comprehensive estimate of the disaster's economic toll.  The projected losses for residential property alone were about $900 million.  Another $1 billion was attributed to commercial and goverment property, including roads and bridges.  In addition, more than 11 thousand people were evacuated, reportedly the largest since Hurricane Katrina.  President Obama declared a state of emergency for Boulder and Larimer Counties, with an additional 10 counties added September 16th including: Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Clear Creek, Denver, Jefferson, Morgan, Logan, Washington and Weld Counties.  The president also declared a major disaster specifically for Boulder County, which provided for federal recovery assistance. ||There were six fatalities directly attributed to flash flooding.  By county, those fatalities included 4 in Boulder County and 2 in Larimer County.  Two 19-yr old teenagers died on the evening of the 11th, after they were swept away by floodwaters after abandoning their vehicle on Lindon Drive in Boulder.  In Jamestown, a 72-yr old man was killed when the building he was in collapsed.  An 80-yr old Lyons resident was killed in the early morning hours of the 12th, when his truck was swept into the St. Vrain River near his home.   On the evening of the 12th, a 79-yr old Larimer County resident was killed when she was swept away while trying to climb to safety from her home in Cedar Point.   A 61-yr old Cedar Point resident died when her home was swept down the Big Thompson River by the floodwaters.  An indirect fatality occurred on the 16th.  An 80-yr old Idaho Springs resident drowned in Clear Creek when the embankment he was standing on collapsed.||Along the South Platte River, the crest of the flood at Kersey was near 18.8 feet on September 14th, which was significantly higher than the record crest of 11.73 feet set on May 8, 1973.   On September 15th, the flood crest was near 13.7 feet at Balzac which exceeded the record of 13.3 feet set on June 18, 1965.  On September 18th, the flood crest was at Julesburg was 10.6 feet, which broke the previous record of 10.44 feet set on June 20, 1965.  ||In Boulder, some of the monthly records broken included:  one-day all-time record:  9.08 inches which shattered the previous wettest day of 4.8 inches set on July 31, 1919; one-month record of 18.16 inches, which broke the previous all-time monthly record of 9.59 inches set in May of 1995; wettest September on record which broke the previous record of 5.5 inches set in September of 1940; one-year record of 34.15 inches broke the previous wettest year of 29.93 inches set in 1995.  In Denver, the total precipitation for the month of September was 5.61 inches, which was 4.65 inches above the normal of 0.96 inches. This is the most precipitation ever recorded in Denver for the month of September.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rain continued to produce widespread flash flooding.

A surface trough was the focus of training storms which produced heavy rainfall that led to major flooding across the Onion Creek and Blanco/San Marcos River watersheds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rains in excess of 14 inches upstream of Austin in the Onion Creek Watershed near Wimberley caused a flash flood that hit portions of South Austin in the early morning hours.  Water started to rise and flood portions of the Onion Creek area near Interstate 35 by 4-5am on the morning of the 31st and water continued to rise into the early morning hours.  USGS gauges were overtopped near Twin Creek Road and this record flood water continued to move along Onion creek, passing under I-35 and inundating several neighborhoods between I-35 and US Highway 183.  A reverse 911 was utilized by the City of Austin to help evacuate residents but flood waters rose so quickly that most residents sheltered in place and were rescued by truck and helicopter later that morning.  Those that tried to escape the flood waters via their vehicles got caught in the rising waters and this led to several fatalities.  A mother and infant son died when their SUV vehicle was swept off the Onion Creek bridge on Bluff Springs Road in the predawn hours around 430 am. Another resident in a neighborhood along Onion Creek was also found drowned as his vehicle got swept off the road and was recovered near Pleasant Valley Drive and William Cannon.  Almost 2 weeks later the body of a homeless man was found in Williamson Creek near South First Street and Heartwood.  He was presumed a flood fatality from this event.  Manual readings were performed by USGS at the Onion Creek/Highway 183 gauge site ATIT2.  The creek crested just over 40 feet at 930 am the morning of October 31st.  This was a new record height for this location and translated to about 135,000 cubic feet per second. In total across Travis County and the City of Austin, over 700 homes were damaged by the flooding, of which over 100 were destroyed.  Most of the affected homes did not have insurance and were within the 100 year flood plain of Onion Creek.  Flood recovery lasted for several weeks including debris removal. Damage estimates are still being calculated as of this writing but damages across Travis County and the City of Austin look like they will exceed 100 million dollars.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The flooding initially began on the east side of the city in the Haywood Rd/downtown airport area, where several cars were stalled in deep, rushing water due to an overflowing culvert on Byrdland Dr (3 E Downtown). A 39-year-old man and 36-year-old woman who abandoned their vehicles to seek higher ground drowned after being swept into the fast-moving water and nearby culvert which drained into Laurel Creek. A tributary of Richland Creek flooded several dozen apartment homes along Villa Rd between Pleasantburg Dr and Pelham Rd (2.5 ENE Downtown). The most severe flooding occurred on the east side of downtown, near the Stone Ave/I-385 intersection, due to a combination of Richland Creek overflowing its banks by several feet and major urban flooding. Multiple vehicles were stalled in high water in this area. The high water caused a gas leak and explosion at a restaurant on Stone Ave, causing significant damage to the exterior of the building. Richland Creek and the Reedy River overflowed their banks and flooded much of Cleveland Park, which remained closed for two days. This was the worst flooding along this portion of the Reedy in almost 10 years. Additionally, a small tributary of Langston Creek flooded the intersection of Langston Dr and Highway 276 (3 NNW Downtown). Finally, Rocky Creek, or a culvert draining into Rocky Creek overflowed along I-85 near the Pelham Rd exit (7 E Downtown), sending water over the southbound lane and forcing closure of the interstate for several hours.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.50M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The activity on the 2nd consisted of elevated thunderstorms with lightning along the coast during the morning and a few thunderstorms over the San Bernardino County mountains. Rain and rapid cooling in one of these storms resulted in several bicyclists being treated for hypothermia during the Tour de Big Bear race. This elevated convection became intense and transitioned into numerous strong thunderstorms on the 3rd, focusing more on the mountains and deserts and closing several roadways due to flooding. Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches occurred in less than 3 hours across steep terrain in the San Bernardino County mountains. The hardest hit areas were Mt Baldy, Forest Falls and Oak Glen where numerous debris flows occurred causing road damage and closures. Incident Command Posts were set up at both Mt Baldy and Valley of the Falls. A weather station in Mt Baldy reported 4 inches of rain in less than 2 hours. Swift water rescues were performed in Mt Baldy along the LA County line. There was also a large area of 1 to 2.5 inches of rain in low-lying areas and deserts, including 2.73 inches in one hour at the Borrego ALERT gage. The Fish Creek RAWS in the San Diego County desert recorded 2.77 inches of rain in one hour, resulting in moderate flooding and the subsequent closure of Fish Creek Road through August 8th. Heavy rain west of the mountains produced flash flooding in Redlands and Ramona. A large sink hole developed in Redland due to heavy rainfall. San Bernardino County was the hardest hit with flash flooding, with 25 homes damaged and approximately $11 million in damage county-wide for this event. Full storm surveys were done from Mill Creek near Forest Falls, to Oak Glen, to Lytle Creek and through out Mt Baldy on August 4th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> CHP reported a flooded wash with multiple cars stuck in the area.  4 inches of rain recorded in gauge within 2 hours on the steep slope of big Mt Baldy. A hiker parked their car in the small town of Mt Baldy and hiked to the top. Hail and lightning caused them to go back down the mountain early. They used the dry creek to go back|down and were swept away in a flash flood over 10 feet, per NWS Storm Survey of high water marks on trees. The hiker's car was found the next|day during the NWS Storm Survey. The car was destroyed and the person drowned somewhere along the middle or bottom of the creek, just on the San Bernardino County side. LA County Fire department led the search and rescue. Since Mt Baldy|town, where the car was parked, is in San Bernardino County they ended up having a unified command with Los Angeles County, San Bernardino Fire, and Town of|Mt Baldy.  At least 2 vehicles were towed out of the creek. We were told at the survey that the cars were on the Los Angeles County side of the mountain but washed downstream, and across the San Bernardino County side of the mountain, where the one fatality of a 48-yr old man from El Segundo, occurred.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Rainfall totals of 10 to 13 inches were reported upstream in southern Blanco County and all of this water entered the Blanco River and Little Blanco River. The Fischer Store Rd. bridge over the Blanco River was destroyed by flood waters west of Wimberley. The Blanco River, down stream from the bridge, at Wimberley reached a record crest. The gauge failed at 40 feet and the USGS later estimated the crest at 44.9 feet with 175,000 cfs. This height was more than 10 feet over the previous record height of 33.3 feet from 1929. Homes along the banks of the Blanco River from the City of Blanco, through Wimberley, and down to San Marcos experienced an historic flood.  Many homes were totally destroyed and swept down stream.  Many homes were struck by large debris, including full size cypress trees which typically lined the banks of the river.  A house in the 100 block of Deer Crossing Ln. in Wimberley was washed away in the flood with nine people inside. There was one lone survivor while eight others died. Six bodies were recovered and the two small children remain missing.  Several of the bodies were recovered near San Marcos Texas nearly 30 miles downstream. Another fatality occurred when a man was washed away with his vehicle. He was 29 years old and was found on May 26 near FM 2325.  A 74 year old male also drown after he was swept off his roof of his house along River Road near Wimberley. The river experienced rises that exceeded 20 feet in one hour.

A cluster of slow moving thunderstorms near and just to the west of Desert Center produced more than 6 inches of rain along Interstate 10; the heavy rain caused significant flash flooding which washed out the eastbound lanes of the freeway. At this location, the interstate crossed a wash, and the flowing water raging through the wash collapsed the bridge across it. One vehicle drove into the wash; fortunately the driver was rescued and there were no fatalities.

Based on radar estimates, over 6 inches of rain fell over several hours along and just to the south of Interstate 10, just to the west of Desert Center. According to a trained weather spotter about 4 miles west of Desert Center, the eastbound lanes of Interstate 10 collapsed where they crossed a heavily flowing wash, and one vehicle drove into the hole in the collapsed bridge. The driver became trapped by crushed asphalt and needed to be rescued. The injured driver was extracted from his truck and taken to a local hospital. According to local law enforcement, Interstate 10 was closed in both directions; water was flowing over the highway and the on and off ramps were flooded. Traffic was backed up for miles and needed to be re-routed. Within a short distance of the collapsed bridge, water flowing through a wash and under the freeway severely eroded and compromised the integrity of a second bridge; the second bridge did not collapse however. Interstate 10 will be closed in both directions for quite some time, probably at least one week, as bridges on both sides of the freeway will need to be re-built. A Flash Flood Warning was issued for the area from 1621PST through 1915PST.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was ahead of a low pressure wave along a strong cold front.  Dew points were in the upper 50s with temperatures in the 60s. The evening convection was elongated along the flow in portions of Wayne, Lincoln and Boone Counties.  Rain amounts as high as an inch were observed in an hour, with 2 inches in less than 3 hours.

The first round of thunderstorms produced some locally heavy rains and damaging winds. A tree was blown down onto a house in Merrillan (Jackson County) and another house near Warrens (Monroe County) sustained roof and siding damage from the winds. A second round of thunderstorms then developed and moved very slowly over the same area as the previous storms. With already wet soils, the heavy rain from this second round of storms produced flash flooding across the very northern sections of Trempealeau County into northern Jackson County and southern Clark County. In Eleva (Trempealeau County), flood waters covered State Highway 93 and U.S. Highway 10 and caused around $400 thousand in damage to a food business. Numerous homes and businesses in Osseo sustained water damage from flooding along the North and South Forks of the Buffalo River. The flood waters covered or washed out numerous roads in Jackson and Clark Counties. Two accidents occurred in Jackson County when people tried to drive their vehicles over water covered roads that had been washed out. The dam at Emerson Lake (Clark County) was damaged by the flood waters with repairs estimated at almost a quarter of a million dollars. State of Emergencies were declared in Jackson and Trempealeau Counties. Total damages were estimated at $1.8 million in Trempealeau County, $800 thousand in Clark County and $400 thousand in Jackson County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flood waters from Schoolhouse Creek caused U.S. Highways 10 and 12 to be closed in the extreme northern part of Jackson County east of Price. Numerous other roads were washed out with general flooding across the northern sections of the county covering much of the Townships of Cleveland and Garfield. Two accidents occurred when the drivers attempted to drive their vehicles over water covered roads that had been washed out. Three residents were stranded when flood waters overtook a dead end road in the Town of Cleveland. There were no reports of damage to private property with the damage limited to roads.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 400.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

More heating, more instability and plenty of moisture on the 22nd led to scattered thunderstorms across the state.  A few of these storms produced wet microbursts that resulted in significant flooding and wind damage.

There were reports of a few swift water rescues with no injuries or deaths along with many roads being closed. The 2.45 inches reported at a COOP site north of Roswell was the largest single day rainfall total in the month of September since the historic flash flood event of 2013.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Media reports indicated a man was swept away and died in fast moving water that filled the north diversion channel arroyo.  Eye witness reports noted the man was outside the arroyo before somehow ending up in it and being swept away.  Search and rescue attempts by the fire department found the body two hours later in the Rio Grande.  The only other information available at this time is that it was a male between the ages of 20 and 30 years old. The intense rainfall rates also washed lots of landscaping material, including rocks, mud, and fabric material, into streets across the metro area. A water mark near Carlisle and Comanche suggested the water was as high as 2 feet in the intersection.

This trough of low pressure was accompanied by a strong subtropical jet stream which provided abundant lift necessary for the development of widespread showers and thunderstorms.  The trough was able to draw up not only Gulf of Mexico moisture but also Eastern Pacific moisture and with a very slow movement to the activity once it developed, the end result was widespread flooding across a large portion of Northeast Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas and Northwest Louisiana. A very unstable airmass for late December was present across the region with a very strongly wind sheared environment. Discrete storms developed across the region ahead of an eventual line of strong to severe thunderstorms.  Some of these discrete storms produced tornadoes across the region with several storms producing strong and damaging wind gusts as well.

The heaviest rainfall occurred in a 50 to 75 mile wide swath from southwest Missouri through the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area and into central Illinois.  Three day rainfall totals within this swath ranged from 6 to 12 inches, with lighter amounts extending both northwest and southeast to the state border.  Some of the precipitation fell as a wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow across northwest portions of the state.  All of this rain caused historic river flooding for the many rivers throughout the region. This resulted in floods of record on the Bourbeuse River at Union, the Meramec River at Pacific, Eureka, Valley Park, and Arnold, and major flooding on the Missouri River (at Gasconade and Hermann), the Mississippi River at Winfield Lock and Dam and points downstream, the Cuivre River at Old Monroe, Dardenne Creek, the Gasconade River, the Moreau River, the Illinois River, and the Kaskaskia River at Vandalia.  The only location not reporting flooding after this event was the Salt River near New London, where the Clarence Cannon Dam regulates the flow.  All other forecast points reported at least minor flooding. Seven flooding deaths were reported in our area due to the heavy rains. Approximately 1500 structures were either damaged or destroyed by the flood waters in the forecast area. At this time dollar amount damages are expected to top $1 billion dollars.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Up to four inches of rain fell causing flash flooding. Numerous roads were flooded. In Grafton, a 42 year old woman was walking home, possibly intoxicated. She was last seen on North Cedar Street at about 11 pm on December 26th, 2015. Authorities suspected she tried to cross a flooded roadway near a creek and was swept out to the Mississippi River and drowned. Her body was finally located March 10th, 2016 about 6 miles downstream.

The heaviest rainfall occurred in a 50 to 75 mile wide swath from southwest Missouri through the Greater St. Louis Metropolitan Area and into central Illinois.  Three day rainfall totals within this swath ranged from 6 to 12 inches, with lighter amounts extending both northwest and southeast to the state border.  Some of the precipitation fell as a wintry mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow across northwest portions of the state.  All of this rain caused historic river flooding for the many rivers throughout the region. This resulted in floods of record on the Bourbeuse River at Union, the Meramec River at Pacific, Eureka, Valley Park, and Arnold, and major flooding on the Missouri River (at Gasconade and Hermann), the Mississippi River at Winfield Lock and Dam and points downstream, the Cuivre River at Old Monroe, Dardenne Creek, the Gasconade River, the Moreau River, the Illinois River, and the Kaskaskia River at Vandalia.  The only location not reporting flooding after this event was the Salt River near New London, where the Clarence Cannon Dam regulates the flow.  All other forecast points reported at least minor flooding. Seven flooding deaths were reported in our area due to the heavy rains. Approximately 1500 structures were either damaged or destroyed by the flood waters in the forecast area. At this time dollar amount damages are expected to top $1 billion dollars.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Automated gauges in the area only measured about an inch of rain between 3 pm and 8 pm. However, this was enough for Louse Creek to rise, covering Farthing Road at a low water crossing, about half a mile north of intersection with Britt Road. A family of 5 was traveling from Kentucky to Minnesota and somehow got lost after getting off of I-57. The family ended up about 2 miles southeast of Patoka, going north on Farthing Road. In the dark, the driver probably did not see the rushing water over the roadway before it was too late. The vehicle was carried about 150 to 200 feet downstream and became lodged in some trees. An occupant of the vehicle called 911 about 730 pm, but shortly after a firefighter arrived on the scene, the car became dislodged and sank.  Dive teams recovered the car from the water several hours later. All 5 occupants were pronounced dead from drowning just before midnight.  The flooding did not affect any structures in the area, just road flooding in a few locations. Also, this area of flooding was well removed from the axis of the heaviest rain that stretched from the eastern Ozarks into central Illinois.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Strong surface cyclogenesis took shape during the day, allowing ample moisture to return northward with strong southerly flow. At the same time, a strong upper level shortwave trough allowed strong mid level westerlies to overspread much of the Plains region. With large instability and wind shear, the stage was set for widespread severe storm development. Storms initiated within the open warm sector ahead of the dryline. The first storm developed near Lawton and moved northeast along I-44 into parts of central Oklahoma, resulting in several tornadoes and large hail. Additional supercells spawned tornadoes across northern Oklahoma, and the slow moving nature of storms lead to several occurrences of flash flooding. Storms continued well into the night.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> One woman perished while seeking shelter from a tornado in a below ground storm cellar.

The worst flooding occurred across eastern and southern Houston and towns north and east of the city. Numerous roadways were flooded including all main lanes of Highway 288 north of Brays Bayou. High rainfall rates caused Brays Bayou to go out of banks and inundate the Lawndale Wayside part of eastern Houston. Four to five feet of water flowed over North Macgregor Way between Merry Lane and Wildwood Way. High water rescues were conducted by the fire department with a half a foot of water entering Fire Station 26 in southeast Houston near Telephone and Bellfort Streets. Highway 59 at Will Clayton Parkway south of Humble was impassable due to high water. Approximately 40 homes were flooded in the Cloverleaf subdivision near Interstate 10 and Beltway 8. Hunting Bayou went out of banks and flooded neighboring homes. High water rescues were performed on Autumnwood and Wood Shadows Drives near Hunting Bayou. A shopping district and surrounding parking lots were flooded in the Crosby and Barrett areas.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The main band of heavy rain extended from northwest of Cedar Hill southeastward to southeastern Jefferson County, south of Festus. Four vehicles were swept off of Meyer Road, just west of intersection with U.S. Highway 67, when Buck Creek rose well above its banks. All four vehicles were swept downstream but only two were occupied, the other two had been in a nearby parking lot. Two bodies were found further downstream, a 35 year old female and a 50 year old female. Authorities say that the owners of the other two vehicles have been accounted for. Several rescues had to be performed including on Montauk Drive just off of U.S. Highway 67, about 2 miles north northeast of Olympian Village. Also, a levee was over topped on Plattin Creek next to Lakeside Manor Mobile Home Park. Four to five feet of water flooded the mobile home park. Sixty to seventy people had to be rescued. Three people were injured and brought to a local hospital. Numerous businesses were flooded. One business had about a dozen ATVs damaged or ruined by the flood waters. Mercy Hospital in Crystal City had to close its emergency department for a couple of days when flood waters came into that area of the hospital, the rest of the hospital remained open. Several homes along Cotter Creek, off of Hillsboro Victoria Road near intersection with Highway P, were damaged/destroyed from flood waters as the creek quickly rose there. One person had to be rescued after her vehicle was swept into Cotter Creek by the flood waters. She was clinging to a tree for over an hour before being rescued. Several roads were washed out due to the flash flooding. Damage to the roads and bridges was estimated around $1.5 million with total damage estimated close to $3-4 million.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Widespread heavy rain developed on October 8th and continued through early on October 9th as Matthew approached and moved offshore of the coast. Rainfall ranged from 2 to 4 inches on the southern beaches to 8 to 12 inches inland. This rain led to significant flash flooding over  much of eastern North Carolina during the afternoon of October 8th through the morning of October 9th. Many roads were washed out and impassable for days from the serious flash flooding. Devastating river flooding then occurred several days after Matthew as most main-stem rivers exceeded major flood levels. Strong winds of 40 to 60 mph inland and 60 to 80 mph along the coast occurred as Matthew passed offshore mainly during the evening of October 8th through the morning of the 9th. These winds led to numerous downed trees and power lines across the region with widespread power outages that lasted several days in some areas. Storm surge inundation was mainly 1 to 3 feet above ground level along the coast, however inundation of 3 to 5 feet above ground level was observed on the sound side of the Outer Banks. ||There were six confirmed fatalities across the area with five in Lenoir County and one in Pitt County. Dollar damages totals have not been completed but will likely exceed 200 million dollars with significant agricultural losses.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Car drove into severe flooding near Mozingo Road near V A O site C road.

There were 15 fatalities in Greenbrier County and widespread catastrophic damage across much of the county. Summers and Monroe counties had much less severe flash flooding. ||The two days prior to the event were quite wet as several rounds of thunderstorms traversed the area with rainfall of roughly 1 to 2 inches across much of Greenbrier County in the 48 hours ending at 0800 EDT on June 23rd. This left the ground quite moist and primed for more efficient runoff.  The synoptic setup for this event featured an upper level ridge over the central U.S. northwest flow across the eastern U.S. Several strong short-waves topped the ridge and dropped southeast across the Ohio Valley toward the central Appalachians with the strongest wave approaching on the morning of the 23rd of June. Satellite imagery showed a deep tap of tropical moisture into West Virginia and a strengthening upper level jet providing additional lift. A warm front was located just north of the area and became a focus for convection in the early morning hours of the 23rd. Up to an inch of rain had fallen across Summers and Greenbrier by 730 AM EDT. Late in the morning, renewed convection from the west entered the area. During the late morning to early afternoon convection continued to train across the same general area of southeast WV and far western VA with hourly rainfall rates of 1.50 to 2. One of the more reliable automated rain gauges at White Sulphur Springs, WV (SUPW2) measured 2.32 and 1.89 in consecutive hours from 1 to 3 PM EDT or 4.21 in 2 hours. The 2-hour, 1000-year ARI at this location per NOAA Atlas 14 is 3.88��� giving an indication of the intensity of the rain.   Toward the end of this time window is when intense flash flooding began across eastern parts of the county but earlier in the far west. Flash Flood Warnings (FFWs) were issued throughout the morning and afternoon and a rare Flash Flood Warning Emergency product was issued  for Greenbrier County by the NWS at 441 PM EDT as the extent of the disaster became apparent. ||Radar and rain gauge measurements showed as much as 8 to 10 inches (perhaps higher locally) fell in a band across central Greenbrier County. The bulk of the rain fell in less than 12 hours between 600 AM and 600 PM. The top five official rain gauge totals (24-hour amounts ending at 8 AM EDT, June 24th) included White Sulphur Springs COOP (WSUW2) 8.29, Lewisburg 3N COOP (LWBW2) 8.00, White Sulphur Springs DCP (SUPW2) 7.83, McCross 3E COOP (MCRW2) 6.54 and Williamsburg VFD IFLOWS (WMBW2) 5.37.  One personal weather station at Maxwelton measured 9.37 and there were several anecdotal reports of 10 or more inches. The 24-hour rainfall at White Sulphur Springs COOP, with fairly complete data back to around 1920 (and sporadic  back to 1888) was more than double the all-time daily record (4.00��� set in March, 1890). Lewisburg 3N COOP with data all the way back to around 1900 also demolished its all-time daily record of 4.06��� set in July, 1954. A point event analysis by the Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center (HDSC) indicated that the rainfall was in the .001 Annual Exceedance Probability (1,000 year Annual Recurrence Interval, or ARI) for a 24-hour period.||The gauged hydrologic response was astounding as small creeks fed rivers that rose almost like a flash flood. An IFLOWS river gage at Ronceverte (RONW2) on the Greenbrier River rose to flood stage of 15 feet by around 730 PM EDT and climbed another 8.2 feet by 1130 PM. The NWS forecast point on Greenbrier River at Alderson (ALDW2) rose very slowly through the afternoon of the 23rd but around 700 PM EDT massive runoff began reaching the USGS gage location. The river rose from just over 4 feet (discharge of 2,300 cfs or cubic ft. per second) at 700 PM to reach flood stage of 14 feet (40,000 cfs) just 2.5 hours later around 930 PM. The river continued an astronomical rate of rise reaching Major Flood Stage (19 feet, 63,000 cfs) by midnight June 24th, before cresting at 22 feet (80,700 cfs) at 430 AM EDT. This was the 3rd highest crest on record (data back to 1895) at Alderson, surpassed only by the January 1996 rain/snowmelt flood and November 1985 flood. According to the latest available USGS report on flood frequency for West Virginia streams the discharge at the Alderson gage was very close to the 0.01 Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) or 100-year annual recurrence interval. A similar extreme response occurred on the Greenbrier River at the Hilldale USGS gage (HLLW2) downstream of Alderson just above the confluence with the New River. It also had its 3rd highest crest (25.45 feet, Flood Stage 16 ft) and discharge (82,508 cfs) on record (data back to 1936) and was also very close to the .01 AEP or 100-year event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Unprecedented flash flooding occurred across large parts of Greenbrier County but especially in a swath across the central part of the county where an estimated 6 to 10 inches of rain fell in less than 12 hours. The first flood-related report was received at 100 PM EDT (1200 PM EST) as a portion of Highway 20 in western Greenbrier County became impassable south of Quinwood due to a mudslide and debris in the road. By 130 PM (1230 EST) there were several reports of flash flooding in the community of Rupert which required the evacuation of a nursing home and a vehicle rescue. Portions of Route 60 were closed between Rainelle and Rupert and severe flash flooding occurred along Big Clear Creek, a tributary of the Meadow River just north of Rupert. A number of homes of homes were badly damaged or destroyed along Big Clear Creek and several water rescues required in the Rupert area. The first flooding reports out of Rainelle in far western Greenbrier County were received at 155 PM (1255 EDT) and described people being trapped in cars and numerous water rescues. Several creeks emerge from the higher terrain surrounding Rainelle and converge in or near the town (Wolfpen Creek, Boggs Creek, Little Sewell Creek), the largest of which is Sewell Creek which then joins the Meadow River just northeast of town. The IFLOWS gage on the Meadow River near Hines (HNEW2) rose rapidly above its Flood Stage of 14 feet by 200 PM EDT and reached Major Flood Stage of 18 feet just two hours later, shortly before it ceased functioning at a stage of 18.8 feet while still rising. Flooding along the Meadow River was extensive with numerous homes and businesses affected. In addition, the rising Meadow River prevented Sewell Creek in Rainelle from discharging into the Meadow River which likely contributed to the rapidly rising water levels in Rainelle. Flooding was catastrophic in the town with water up to 8 feet deep or more and numerous homes flooded. There were four fatalities in Rainelle and three in Rupert, all due to asphyxiation (drowning). ||Meanwhile, numerous flood reports continued to be received although the 911 center and Emergency Management were completely overwhelmed with calls. The Greenbrier County Sheriff described 'complete chaos' across the county in a media report as dozens of roads were closed, damaged or destroyed and many water rescues were made from cars and structures. Especially hard hit was the White Sulphur Springs area in the eastern part of the county. Several small streams also descend rapidly from higher surrounding terrain and converge in or near White Sulphur Springs including Dry Creek and Wades Creek which join Howard Creek in the town, which itself is a large tributary of the Greenbrier River. All were transformed into raging torrents which tore through parts of the town taking trees, cars and even homes downstream. One of the more horrifying images was of a burning home being carried downstream on Howard Creek before colliding with a bridge. This creek runs through portions of the famous Greenbrier Resort and images of the normally tranquil stream converted into a massive river covering portions of the golf course were widely shared on social and conventional media. Howard Creek flooded long stretches of U.S. Highway 60 downstream of White Sulphur Springs, causing severe damage all along the way to its confluence with the Greenbrier River at Caldwell, six miles downstream. Parts of Route 60 were essentially destroyed and probably dozens of cars were swept into the creek and deposited along the way. There were seven fatalities in and around the White Sulphur Springs area, all but one from drowning. One person's body was found some 30 miles downstream on the Greenbrier River from where she was believed to have been swept into a creek that feeds the river. The body of a teenage girl from White Sulphur Springs was not found for over 6 weeks, eventually winding up in the Caldwell area on the Greenbrier River. There was significant flooding all along the Greenbrier River with Caldwell, Ronceverte and Alderson the hardest hit as the river rose at near flash-flood rates and crested in the Major Flood category (see Episode for details). Numerous homes were flooded in the town of Alderson (Pop: 1184), according to the Mayor. A state of emergency was declared for a number of counties in West Virginia during and after the event and a Major Federal Disaster for over  dozen counties was declared on June 25, 2016 by the President of the U.S. Fatalities in the county totaled 15 with an unknown number of injuries. There was over $5.5 million in public road/bridge damage in Greenbrier County and substantial damage to private roads and bridges. Preliminary data showed 319 homes destroyed and 353 damaged across the county, mostly in the Rainelle and White Sulphur Springs areas. In addition, 12 businesses were destroyed and 20 damaged along with numerous motor vehicles destroyed. Final damage totals for the event are not available from Emergency Management officials as of this writing but an estimate $40 million may not be unreasonable.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Flash flooding on small streams turned into river flooding. A historic and record setting flood occurred along portions of the Elk and Gauley Rivers in central West Virginia.  Less significant flooding occurred on the perimeter of the hardest hit area.||The initial convective complex developed during the evening hours of the 22nd near Chicago.  The complex reached southeast Ohio just after 0000E on the 23d, while a surface warm front was returning northeast into West Virginia.  A few renegade storms even formed ahead of the complex along the warm front.  ||The first round of convection entered West Virginia around 0100E on the 23rd. It crossed West Virginia during the predawn hours with downpours and gusty winds. Within this initial round of convection, a brief tornado was confirmed in Jackson County. Also, a microburst was surveyed just south of Birch River in Nicholas County. ||The first complex exited the eastern counties of the state a few hours after dawn.  Yet, the undisturbed southwest low level flow, of moisture rich air, allowed new convection to form in its wake.  These new showers and storms formed in the mid Ohio Valley from southern Ohio eastward toward the Huntington and Charleston vicinity. These thunderstorms moved back east, across central West Virginia during the late morning and midday time frame.  In the muggy air, additional storms formed during the afternoon and early evening hours.  The rains finally diminished after 1900E on the 23rd.  The total duration of these multiple rounds of convective showers and storms encompassed no more than 18 hours.||A 2 to 4 inch rain maximum occurred with the initial convective complex.  This initial rain maximum ran from near Parkersburg on up the Little Kanawha River Valley to near Glenville and through Upshur Counties.  Other heavier bands were in Lewis and Harrison Counties. For example, by 0900E, Pullman in Ritchie County and Spurgeon in Gilmer County both measured 3.76 inches. Harrisville in Ritchie County measured 3.48 inches of rain. Willow Island on the Ohio River measure 3.38 inches. French Creek had 3.4 inches of rain.  The cooperative observer at Clarksburg measured 3.30 inches, Stonewall Jackson Lake in Lewis County had 3.05 inches and Rock Cave measured 2.8 inches of rain.  In terms of rain rates, the Clarksburg airport in Bridgeport had .5 inches of rain in just 8 minutes, with 1.36 inches of rain in about 40 minutes.  Minor flash flooding occurred with this initial convective band during the predawn and dawn time frame.  Less rains fell further south.  For example, Big Chimney in Kanawha County had 1.76 inches by 0900E. ||The new convection that formed during the morning of the 23rd, saw its heavier rain fall south of the initial band.  The rain axis went from Jackson County on southeast into Clay and Nicholas Counties.  By 1200E, Poe North in Nicholas County had 4.52 inches of rain, Laurel Ridge in Clay county had a 3.72 inches total, and Muddlety in Nicholas County measured a 3.31 inch rain total.||After the third and fourth rounds of convection during the afternoon and evening, a 4 to 7.5 inch rainfall maximum occurred in less than 18 hours. The axis of this maximum rain went from Jackson County on southeast through Roane, northern Kanawha, Clay, Nicholas, Webster, into southern Pocahontas. The rain maximum continued into central Greenbrier County, which is handled by the Blacksburg office of the National Weather Service.  This elongated heavy rain axis was oriented on a compass heading from around 305 degrees to 125 degrees. The width of the heavy rain area went from around 30 miles near the Ohio River to about 50 miles in the central mountain counties.  A key ingredient to this disaster was the fact that less than 2 days earlier, 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain had fallen over parts of Clay, Webster, and Nicholas Counties. As a result, a higher percentage of the rain on the 23rd went directly into runoff than usual.     ||Here are the maximum measured storm rain totals.  Laurel Ridge in Clay County measured 7.21 inches of rain.  A volunteer observer in Runa of Nichalas County had 7.2 inches. Along the county line with Clay and Kanawha Counties, Queen Shoals measured 7.12 inches of rain.  Birch River had 5.81 inches, Summersville 5.65 inches, Craigsville 5.63 inches, Richwood 5.53 inches, Sutton 5.47 inches, Hacker Valley 5.06 inches, Sissonville 4.02 inches, Snowshoe 3.97 inches, and Spencer 3.74 inches. An automatic gauge west of Summersville Lake near Keslers Cross Lanes measured 6.16 inches. At one point during the afternoon, this gauge measured 1.1 inches of rain in just 15 minutes.  A gauge near the headwaters of Beach Fork in western Nicholas County measured 5.5 inches of rain.   An unofficial rain gauge at a coal company near Werth of Nicholas County measured a 6.6 inch rain total.        |  |Severe flash flooding occurred on the creeks and streams during the later rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon. This was quickly followed by river flooding on the Greenbrier, Elk, and Gauley Rivers. This included the smaller tributaries such as the Williams River and the Meadow River in the Gauley River basin, plus the Birch River in the Elk River basin.  Fatalities occurred in Kanawha and Jackson Counties. Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties. ||Record stages were set on the upper Gauley River.  Dyer on the Williams River rose 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd and crested at 20.78 feet around 1915E.  The previous record level at Dyer was 18.45 feet back on July 4th in 1932.  The flooding in Richwood was as much from the runoff off the steep mountainsides flowing rapidly down through the streets, as it was from the overflowing Cherry River.  Laurel Creek, a tributary of the Cherry River, near Fenwick crested at 12.34 feet around 2000E.   On the main stem of the Gauley River, Craigsville crested at 29.04 feet after rising 17 feet in the vertical on the 23rd.   At one point between 1400 and 1500E the river rose 3 feet in 1 hour.  The crest time was 2200E on the 23rd at Craigsville.  The previous record was 25.94 feet back in November of 2003.  The crest at Camden on Gauley was above the level of the instrument shelf table in the river stage well house.  Of course, this caused the instruments to fail.  Before failure, the river was rising nearly 3 feet per hour.  In the wake of the flood, the well defined high water mark was used to calculated the crest.  After a vertical rise of around 24 feet, the crest at Camden on Gauley was 29.75 feet near 2145E on the 23rd. The previous record was 27.38 feet, back on July 4th in 1932.  In the town of Camden on Gauley, the high water mark was 7 feet high on buildings.  While holding the discharge down, the Corps of Engineers saw Summersville Lake rise 41 feet in the vertical during this flood.||Below Summersville Dam a huge discharge was noted from the Meadow River into the lower Gauley River.  The surge of water coming from western Greenbrier County caused the lower Meadow River at Nallen to rise 19.5 feet in the vertical and crest at 24.50 feet at 2015E on the 23rd. The previous record crest at Nallen was 16.94 feet back in December of 1969.  Further down the Gauley River, despite Summersville Dam holding back much of the outflow from the upper Gauley basin, the gauge at Belva still rose 22 feet in the vertical in less than 18 hours.  Belva crested at 27.04 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This crest was the 2nd highest on record. The 5th of July crest in 1932, well prior to the dam, was 28.6 feet at Belva.  One resident near Belva said of the river flood, ���It just kind of looked like the ocean, and it just swarmed in. And it just didn���t go back.���||In the upper Elk River basin, the gauge below Webster Springs at Clifton Ford crested at 17.36 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  This was not a record crest, but the highest since the start of the 20th century.  Herold on the Birch River, after rising 15 feet in the vertical, crested at 18.03 feet around 2045E on the 23rd.  The previous record was 13.7 feet in December 2013.      ||On the lower Elk River, below the Corps of Engineers flood control dam at Sutton, the water level at Clay rose 26 feet in the vertical during the 23rd, at a rate as high as 3 feet per hour.  The crest was at 30.3 feet around 2145E on the 23rd.  This was the 3rd highest crest on record for Clay, and the highest since 1918. Further down the river at Queen Shoals, just above Clendenin, the water level rose 27 feet in the vertical, at a rate as high as 2.5 feet per hour. The crest was 33.37 feet around 0445E on the 24th.  This was the highest on record for Queen Shoals. The previous record was 32 feet back in 1888. The high water mark was 5 feet high on buildings in downtown Clendenin.  A similar high water mark was noted across the Elk River in the large grocery store.  ||In comparison to the Elk and Gauley drainage, the river flooding on the Greenbrier River in Pocahontas County was minor.  The headwaters of the Greenbrier River were north of the heavy rain axis.  The crest in Marlinton was 12 feet during the late evening of the 23rd, with flood stage at 10 feet.  Further down the river, the level at Buckeye crested just below the 12 foot flood stage.  ||The flash floods and river floods caused fatalities in Kanawha and Jackson Counties.  Thankfully, no fatalities occurred in Roane, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, or Pocahontas Counties. Severe damage and destruction of homes, businesses, and schools occurred. Roads were damaged. In the worst cases, sections of road bed were washed away.  Public bridges and small private bridges were damaged or destroyed. Large debris piles collected against bridges. Countless vehicles were flooded.  Electricity and water were lost for days in the hardest hit flood areas.         ||The American Red Cross had over 800 workers helping at its peak.  They distributed over 7,500 cleanup kits and over 100,000 meals and snacks.  Many church based organizations and ordinary individual citizens volunteered their time and services to help in the flood recovery.  Nationally known celebrities and sport figures, with ties to West Virginia, also helped to raise awareness and increase donations for flood recovery.||The state transportation secretary estimated 8 million dollars in damage to roads in Clay County, 8 million dollars in Nicholas, over 13 million in Kanawha County.||Several schools were severely damaged by flood waters. This included in Clay County, White Elementary and the county bus garage. In Kanawha County, Herbert Hoover High School, Clendenin Elementary, Elk Valley Christian School, plus Bridge Elementary Schools were severely damaged.  Water from the Elk River crested about 7 feet deep in the first flood at Herbert Hoover High School. In Nicholas County. Richwood High and Middle School was severely damaged.  Moderate flood damage occurred to Clay High School and Elkview Middle School.  Minor flood damage occurred at Middle Birch Elementary School in Braxton County.  Minor flood damage also was seen in Ansted Elementary in Fayette County and Glade Elementary in Webster County.||A state of emergency was declared by Governor Tomblin.  At its peak deployment, around 650 members of the West Virginia Army National Guard and West Virginia Air National Guard were activated.  Major tasks assigned to the guard troops included delivering supplies to residents with no road access, and removal of flood debris.  Private contractors were also used for debris removal. In just Kanawha County, 15,000 tons of flood debris were collected.       ||A federal disaster was quickly declared by President Obama.  At least 8 counties were eligible from the events of June 23rd and 24th within the forecast area of the National Weather Service in Charleston. They included Jackson, Roane, Kanawha, Clay, Webster, Nicholas, Fayette, and Pocahontas Counties.  See FEMA disaster number 4273-DR for more information.  Over 4900 individuals applied for federal assistance from those 8 counties, totaling over 20 million dollars.  Public assistance for debris removal, emergency protective services, roads, bridges, and schools, was over 50 million dollar in those same 8 counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flash flooding occurred in scattered locations, mostly in the northern half of the county.  In Ravenswood, a small stream along Utah Road called Lick Run is usually ankle deep. It rose 6 feet. A 4 year old toddler slipped into the water. The grandfather jumped in, but could not rescue him. His body was found the following day, about a quarter mile away. ||A preliminary damage assessment was done in this county.  It had 10 homes destroyed and about 2 dozen with damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Satellite imagery showed a deep tap of tropical moisture into West Virginia and a strengthening upper level jet providing additional lift. A warm front was located just north of the area and became a focus for convection in the early morning hours of the 23rd. During the late morning to early afternoon convection continued to train across the same general area of southeast WV and far western VA with hourly rainfall rates of 1.50 to 2 for several hours.||Radar and rain gauge measurements showed as much as 4 to 8 inches (perhaps higher locally) fell in a band across central Alleghany County. The bulk of the rain fell in less than 12 hours between 600 AM and 600 PM EDT. The Governor of Virginia declared a state of emergency in the City of Covington and Alleghany County.||The phenomenal runoff from creeks, streams and overland flow produced an extreme hydrologic response on larger rivers including the Jackson River. The river gage at Covington (CVGV2) rose over 10 feet in 5 hours to reach Flood Stage (17 feet) for the first time since September 2004 (during the remains of Hurricane Jeanne).  A River Flood Warning (FLW) was issued at 609 PM as the river was near 15 feet and the crest was only 4.5 hours later at 22.33 feet just below the Major Flood Stage of 23 feet. This was highest stage reached at the Covington gage since the November 1985 flood (23.31 feet) and 2nd highest since the construction of Gathright Dam in 1979. Gathright Dam was built to reduce flooding on the Jackson River but so much rain fell in the watershed below the dam that flooding still occurred at Covington. Numerous homes and several businesses in Covington suffered severe flood damage from the Jackson River.  At the same time Dunlap Creek (DLPV2), which drains 162 mi2 of western Alleghany County and empties into the Jackson River in Covington was also rising at an extreme rate, climbing from a stage of around 3 feet (445 cfs) at 200 PM to a record stage of 16.49 feet (30,300 cfs) in a little over 6 hours.  The previous record at this gage was 15.65 feet (27,400 cfs) set in June 1972 with the remains of Hurricane Agnes. Hydrological peak stage records at this gage date back to 1929. According to USGS flood frequency reports this flood was likely in excess of a 200-year (0.005 AEP) event on Dunlap Creek. There was extensive flooding along Dunlap Creek with roads and homes flooded and some requiring evacuations. Flooding continued downstream and a few hours later a River Flood Warning was issued for the upper James River including the forecast points at Lick Run (LIRV2) and Buchanan (BNNV2) both of which easily reached flood stage. At Lick Run the crest of 22.84 feet was the 10th highest on record (continuous records since 1925) and the highest since January 1996 (25.03 feet).  Per USGS data the 48,000 cfs discharge at Lick Run was roughly a 10-year (.10 AEP) flood event. At Buchanan the 42,900 cfs was merely somewhere between a 2- to 5-year event (0.5 to 0.2 AEP).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flash flooding was first reported in Alleghany County at 215 PM EDT (115 PM EST) as Indian Draft Road (Route 600) was closed. Numerous additional reports and social media reports continued to be received through the afternoon. Numerous small streams flooded including Wilson Creek which overflowed Route 629 (Douthat Park Road). The most serious flooding was along Dunlap Creek with runs through the southwestern portions of the county joining the Jackson River just north of Covington. More than 25 homes were badly damaged in the county most of them along Dunlap Creek which set a new flood of record (see Episode for details). Water was reported over Route 60 from Dunlap Creek in several areas. Two water rescues by boat were performed and several landslides were reported including one that was reported to have closed Pitzer Ridge Road (Route 657) east of Route 18.

Another person drowned south of Viroqua (Vernon County) when the driver of a truck pulling a cattle trailer attempted to drive through flood waters during the afternoon or evening of the 22nd. The truck and trailer became stuck in the flood waters, which filled the passenger compartment of the truck. The flooding occurred as several rounds of thunderstorms with heavy rain moved across southwest Wisconsin from the morning of September 21st into the morning of the 22nd. The heavy rain resulted in flash flooding across portions of Adams, Clark, Crawford, La Crosse, Monroe, Richland, Vernon and Trempealeau Counties. A train derailed near Ferryville (Crawford County) when the roadbed was washed away by flooding. Around 1,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled into the water from one of the locomotives. Two people had to be rescued near De Soto (Vernon County) and another in Sidie Hollow County Park southwest of Viroqua (Vernon County). Washouts and road closures occurred in Trempealeau, La Crosse, Vernon and Crawford Counties. In Vernon County alone, high water and flooding resulted in 90 road closures and 44 homes and business were destroyed. Public and private sector damages in Vernon County totaled almost $10 million. In Crawford County, 2 homes were destroyed with another 67 damaged with public and private sector damages totaling almost $5 million. Flooding on the Black River in Black River Falls (Jackson County) caused the hydroelectric dam to loose a gate when a large tree traveled over the dam. Several boats and docks that broke loose in Lake Arbutus also traveled over the dam. A state of emergency was declared in Clark, Crawford, Jackson and Vernon Counties. The Governor of Wisconsin declared a state of emergency for Adams, Clark, Crawford, Jackson, La Crosse, Monroe, Richland, Trempealeau and Vernon Counties. A federal disaster declaration was made for Adams, Clark, Crawford, Jackson, Juneau, La Crosse, Monroe and Vernon Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rain caused flash flooding to occur across much of Vernon County. One person was killed near Victory when a mudslide caused a home to slide down a hillside very early in the morning of the 22nd. Numerous other houses were damaged by rocks, debris and floodwaters in Victory when a culvert used to divert water around town became blocked. In and around De Soto, two people had to be rescued from flood waters and 15 people were evacuated from a trailer park. The flood waters also covered State Highway 35. Flooding along Coe Hollow Creek prompted officials to evacuate Sidie Hollow Park but not before one person had to be rescued. Flood waters from the Kickapoo River flooded the west side of La Farge and caused State Highway 131 to be closed both north and south of town. Flooding from the Kickapoo River also sent water spilling into Viola and Readstown. State Highway 82 was closed west of La Farge because of flood waters from Otter Creek. Street flooding occurred in Viroqua where the water was up to 4 feet deep on Main Street. A state of emergency was declared in the county and there were up to 90 roads closed due to flooding.

One of these rescues involved a couple who under estimated the depth of the water over the highway and drove through the flood waters on Highway 9.  The vehicle was washed off the road and caught in a tree.  The couple escaped from the vehicle and climbed into the tree, remaining there until rescuers arrived.  There was one direct fatality from the flooding.  The individual was driving north from Graham County on county roads toward Lenora.  He drove into flood waters, under estimating their depth.  His vehicle was washed off the road.  His body was found a quarter mile away from the vehicle.  In general, the majority of the rainfall fell south of CR W.  Rainfall amounts of five to seven inches were common across southern Norton County.

The system tapped into deep tropical moisture resulting in very intense rainfall across a large portion of the area. Two-day rainfall totals of 10 inches or more were common across areas generally to the west and northwest of Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas. The heaviest rainfall occurred across a swath of East Baton Rouge, Livingston, and St. Helena Parishes, where 20 to 30 inches fell over a 48-hour period, topping the 0.1% annual exceedance probability. The heavy rainfall led to widespread flash flooding and record river flooding. Many of the broken records had been set during the flooding of April 1983. In total, 12 people died in southeast Louisiana as a result of the flooding. The event was also responsible for an estimated total of ten billion dollars in damage across southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi. This estimate includes impacts of both the initial flash flooding and the resultant river flooding.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Sixteen to twenty inches of rainfall over a 2 day period led to widespread flash flooding in St. Helena Parish. As water drained into area rivers, rapid rises and record flooding occurred along the Amite and Tickfaw Rivers. As floodwaters rose, numerous high water rescues were necessary across the parish. Road closures due to high water were common and over 400 homes and businesses suffered various degrees of damage. A section of Louisiana Highway 10 near the Coleman Town community was overtopped with some of the road washed out.  In Greensburg, flood waters rose high enough to enter the parish hospital. Two fatalities are attributed to the flash flooding. A 54 year old man drowned when his truck was submerged after being swept off a road east of Greensburg Friday afternoon. A 44 year old woman drowned when her vehicle was swept off Hwy 1045 near Montpelier Friday night.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 22.60M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Hot and humid conditions led to an unstable atmosphere. The instability along with the boundary caused a few severe thunderstorms to develop. Thunderstorms merged across Montgomery, Howard and Baltimore counties and led very heavy rainfall that led to flash flooding. Catastrophic flash flooding occurred in Ellicott City, MD the night of July 30th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The survey revealed clear signs of flooding both from the Patapsco River and from flash flooding within Ellicott City.  Signs of flooding, including damaged pavement, were observed as far up as the intersection of Rogers Avenue and Frederick Road, where Hudson Branch came out of its banks. From this location, eyewitnesses reported seeing water not only in the creek, but moving swiftly down Main Street beginning just after dark.  The intersection of Rogers Avenue and Frederick Road is about 140 feet higher in elevation than the lower part of Old Town Ellicott City. Erosion was noted on both the street side and the creek side of homes along Main Street in a portion of the 8500 block.||The next signs of damage were in the 8300 block of Main Street, with damage again observed both on the creek/river side and the street side of Main Street.  The creek/river side is where the most vehicles were impacted, in Lot D.||In the 8200 block, surveys and surveillance footage show water anywhere from 6 inches to two feet inside buildings on Main Street along with substantial damage to sidewalks and infrastructure outside the buildings.||The most significant damage observed was near 8100 Main Street, where the street curves slightly. Video surveillance footage reviewed after the event clearly indicates that water from the Tiber River was flowing through buildings on the south side of Main Street in this area, toward the street.||Closer to the Patapsco, damage continued with water marks observed 6-8 feet high on and in most buildings. The force of the floodwaters swept away the iconic Ellicott City clock as well as the historical flood marker that was attached to the railroad bridge.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 22.40M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The USDA secretary declared the following counties agricultural disaster areas due to destroyed crops or sharply reduced yields: Douglas, Bayfield, Ashland, Iron, Washburn, Sawyer and Price.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A sheriff deputy was rescued from Twentymile Creek near Mason, WI after he mistakenly drove his vehicle into a washed-out section of road caused by heavy rainfall across the region. The deputy clung to a tree using an emergency tourniquet to keep from being swept away. It took emergency personnel close to 4 hours to rescue the deputy. The deputy was rushed to the hospital where he was hospitalized for kidney failure and other life-threatening problems associated with clinging to the tree in the flood waters. The deputy has since made a full recovery and returned to duty later that month.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

If not blown off, non-concrete roofs suffered some type of damage. Nearly all commercial signs, fences, and canopies were destroyed, including large digital high definition boards. The last time that Puerto Rico experienced a category 4 or stronger hurricane was back on 1928 with Hurricane San Felipe II.  Maria was the strongest hurricane to make landfall in mainland Puerto Rico since Hurricane Felipe II in 1928, a category 5 storm. |The NOAA estimate of damage in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands due to Maria is 90 billion dollars.||Death toll from hurricane Maria at the moment of this report is highly uncertain. The official number stands at 65 deaths. 20 of these deaths occurred during the hurricane. The other 45 deaths occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane. From these 45 deaths, there were four (4) people which died due to heart attack,  three (3) due to lack of respiratory aid and three more (3) people due to lack of medical supplies. In addition two (2) deaths were due to suicides. One person (1) died when a tree fell over his car while driving. As of late November 2017, there were three (3) confirmed deaths from leptospirosis. One person (1) died during hurricane preparations. One women (1) died when she fell from her wheel chair. Her house was flooded, and she drowned.|The reasons of the remainder of the deaths are unknown at the moment of this publication.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Catastrophic flash flooding occurred along Rio Grande de Arecibo in the municipality of Utuado.

The cold front gradually progressed across the Ohio Valley and thunderstorms initiated and swept east ahead of the front.

A rain gauge network in Mill Creek Township measured an instantaneous rainfall rate of over 7 inches per hour around 630 pm. The storms produced a measured 3.85 inches of rainfall  in the Erie/Mill Creek area. The intensity of the rainfall ultimately overwhelmed storm drainage systems causing significant overland flooding. In Mill Creek some roads were reported to have as much as five feet of water with numerous water rescues conducted. Some structures sustained damage and the Mill Creek Fire Department had to evacuate. The most significant damage occurred in on East 30th Street in Erie where a basement wall collapsed from the water pooling on the outside, trapping and ultimately drowning two residents. The flooding was likely exasperated by the poor drainage, but ultimately it was the torrential nature of the rainfall that caused the damages.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 270.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Another round of training storms developed the night of the 16th, fed by a moist low-level jet. Training storms and slow storm motion led to heavy rainfall across Douglas, Bayfield, Ashland and Iron counties. Three day rainfall amounts of 6-10 inches were common through these counties with a vast majority of it falling during the night of the 16th into the 17th. Areas of central Bayfield county saw in excess of 15 inches or rainfall during this event. This led to historic flooding focused in the Drummond, Grand View and Benoit areas of Bayfield County, along with the Foxboro, Chaffey and Dairyland areas of western Douglas County. The KDLH radar failed during the evening of June 16th and frequent lighting prevented the restoration of service until after daybreak on the 17th, resulting in the main radar covering this event not being available. One man was killed after his vehicle left the road and went into a ditch filled with 6-8 feet of water near the Bad River south of Ashland. Additionally, one or more microbursts were reported in central Sawyer County near Grindstone Lake resulting in tree damage and damage to homes. One man was killed when a tree fell on his camper near the town of Edgewater. The runoff from the storms continued to cause problems into the new week as it led to significant rises on area rivers and additional flooding. Damages estimates of $95,706 for Ashland County, $3,988,546 for Bayfield County, $66,180 for Burnett County, $3,875,140 for Douglas County, and $701,922 for Iron County, totaling $8,727,494. The DNR reported damage totaling $4,212,077 in the region, resulting in a total of $12,939,615 in damages in northwest Wisconsin from this event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A truck went into a ditch on County Truck E just south of County Trunk C in the Township of White River.

By the afternoon, it had made its way into central portions of the state, draping itself in a southwest to northeast fashion. Ahead of the front, the convective environment was ripe, with MUCAPE values in excess of 4000 J/kg and effective shear in the 30 to 40 kt range, with best values near the front.  While there was reason for concern with regards to severe weather, such has hail and damaging winds, there was also strong concern for an area of west-central, north central or central Iowa to receive heavy rainfall with the boundary placement, potential outflow boundary locations, low level jet initiation, and a very moist environment.  There was expectation for storms to be slow moving or training initially along the frontal boundary with propagation vectors opposing mean flow.||Initially storms fired up in the early afternoon across parts of northwest and north central Iowa in the very unstable environment, producing severe hail and wind damage. Fortunately, given their progressive nature, no water issues were seen with that round of convection. As the afternoon progressed, convection increased across northern areas, but remained quiet further south into central and southern Iowa. The initial northern convection pushed out an outflow boundary that made its way into the I-80 corridor, acting as another area for convective initiation. By the late evening, convection had fired up along the parent frontal boundary as well as portions of the aforementioned outflow boundary, producing marginally severe storms in most cases. By the time the low level jet kicked in, areas around Des Moines had already received a couple inches of rain, and now found the area in line for much more. Overall motion of storms was northeastward, but with nearly stationary frontal and outflow boundaries, backbuilding was induced by the low level jet, which resulted in copious amounts of heavy rainfall right on top of the Des Moines metro and surrounding areas. While some damaging wind was still ongoing, the primary concern was for heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and eventually a flash flood emergency. The Des Moines metro area took on widespread amounts of 6 or more inches, including a few reports of nearly 10 inches.  The main impacts revolved around flash flooding and the flash flood emergency with sewer systems and local streams absolutely overwhelmed. Dozens of vehicles were flooded or stranded, with numerous water rescues performed. Many streams were out of their banks, and an individual was swept away and killed during the flash flooding. One home had flooding and a gas leak that lead to an explosion of the home. Luckily all occupants had already been evacuated. Two streams with NWS stream gauge observations, Four Mile Creek and Walnut Creek, set all-time crest records.  Countless basements and businesses were flooded across the metro area and dozens of homes were completely flooded out on the southeast side where Four Mile Creek flooding was the worst. Two businesses had roof collapses from the heavy rain as well. The flash flooding and stream flooding continued into the overnight hours on July 1, so another entry is made in July 2018 for this event as well.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Emergency manager reported multiple water rescues across Ankeny, Johnston, Des Moines and Urbandale.

Many trees were blown down in the water logged soil especially across Pittsylvania, Halifax and Charlotte counties of Virginia where rainfall was heaviest.  Despite some initial reports of tornado sightings, damage surveys revealed no conclusive evidence of tornadic circulations and judged damage was caused by straight line winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Danville City was included in a Presidential Major Disaster declaration due mainly to the severe flooding associated with Tropical Storm Michael. Catastrophic flash flooding occurred across the City of Danville as extreme rains of 4 to 8 inches in several hours fell. Two people were killed in Danville after being were caught inside vehicles in the floodwaters and were pulled under rising waters as rescuers struggled to reach them. The first was 53-year old man that occurred at 500 PM local time in the 100 block of Colonial Court. The second occurred around 1020 PM on Goodyear Boulevard, as a 60-year old woman was trapped in her car in floodwaters and drowned. There were at least a dozen other high water rescues reported several of these along Riverside Drive where water was reported up to four feet deep. There was severe road and property damage across Danville with costs running into the millions of dollars. According to an early assessment from the Danville Fire Chief, five properties were completely destroyed, 19  sustained major damage, 55 received minor damage and 117 structures were affected.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This widespread rainfall created a massive flood along the Llano River and its nearby creeks.

This is the 2nd highest ever recorded height on the river in the city of Llano.  Flow peaked out about 285,000 CFS around 730 AM that morning nearly coming up to the level of the Highway 16 (Ford St.) bridge in town.  Several homes were flooded along the river with damage to the area parks as well.  A 58 year old woman lost her life in her vehicle as she was trying to get to work in town near West Sandstone and Flag Street.  Time when she entered the water is unknown but is estimated around 5 AM that morning.  Phone and internet service went down as the high water flow washed away phone lines underneath the Llano River Bridge.

In fact, very heavy rainfall moved north into Kimble County from Edwards County, up the South Llano River watershed area during the early morning hours of Monday, October 8.  ||About eight to 12 inches of rain fell on already saturated ground, causing major flooding over the banks of Cedar Creek and the South Llano River.  A ranging flash flood on the South Llano flooded out an RV Park located on the South Llano River in Junction, drowning four campers.  The water level at the RV Park on the South Llano River was estimated at around 21 feet.  Earlier in the morning, the South Llano River at telegraph had risen to 35 feet before the gauge failed.  The gauge reading at the Llano River near Junction measured 31.53 feet on October 8.||Additional heavy rain fell across West Central Texas and resulted in flooding and flash flooding across the area.  The following counties received a Presidential Disaster Declaration for the September through October flooding:  Brown, Callahan, Edwards, Haskell, Jones, Kimble, Mason, Nolan, San Saba, Shackelord, Sutton, Taylor and Throckmorton.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Some rural residents were trapped in their homes by a major flash flood on the S. Llano River and Cedar Creek, in some cases requiring them to be rescued. Others awoke to find water in their homes and were able to evacuate themselves.||The Above and Beyond RV Resort, located adjacent to the South Llano River, was completely flooded, washing RVs and motor vehicles down stream, trapping people who sought refuge in trees in the park, and carrying some down the river. First responders who arrived at the scene before daylight, heard people, who they were unable to see in trees and on top of RVs, calling for help.  They threw life preservers to the victims in the water. ||Miraculously, a woman who was staying at the RV park was carried about 23 river miles downstream before being rescued near Yates Crossing.  She was slightly injured. At least two others were injured.  ||Old Cedar Creek flows into the South Llano River just a few hundred yards above the park. In the early hours of Monday morning, the normally small creek came expanded to 300 yards in size and poured volumes of water into the S. Llano.  This water seemed to have arrived just prior to the wall of water from the South Llano.  Rescue workers said they could hear the sound of a roar with a wall of water coming down the river. ||Authorities have reported that 40-45 people were evacuated and 19 people were rescued by helicopter or swift water rescue boats.  There were three men and one woman who drowned.  Some of these victims did all they could to help others evacuate the RV Park.||Cost of road damage was estimated at 9 million dollars.

In addition to the Spencer Dam failure, several privately owned dams failed. The failure of these private dams contributed to additional overland flooding and most likely exacerbated the flooding in localized areas that led to community evacuations. The combination of weather elements on ice in the rivers led to increased runoff and rapid breakup of ice.

Over four inches of rain occurred in Union County, prompting water rescues from vehicles. Damaging winds up to around 60 mph occurred with a few of the storms as well. The environment was characterized by moderate to strong instability and moderate wind shear. Effective bulk wind shear values of 25 to 40 knots were observed.

There were two water rescues in the county. One car stalled in high water on Mount Glen Road near Cobden. First responders were able to rescue the driver, a young female. The second water rescue involved a vehicle in the Trail of Tears State Forest near Ware. The vehicle was swept off State Forest Road where it crosses Clear Creek. Two people were in the vehicle at the time it was swept off the road. The male involved was able to escape. The body of the other person in the vehicle, a female in her late 50's, was found deceased the following morning less than a mile downstream from the vehicle. Elsewhere in the area, one lane of Highway 146 near the intersection of Highway 3 was flooded. A trained spotter reported 4.0 inches of rainfall in 24 hours three miles east of Ware.

Showers across the southern Adirondacks and Mohawk Valley became steadier and heavier during the evening ahead of a strong cold front as the low continued to strengthen. Strong winds aloft mixed down to the surface as an intense line of showers developed along the front, resulting in sporadic wind damage and scattered power outages over eastern New York.||A large swath of rainfall totaling 2-5 inches, with isolated areas as high as 7 inches, occurred over the Mohawk Valley and southern Adirondacks, resulting in reports of flash flooding. The runoff caused rapid rises on area creeks and streams, with river gauges reaching record levels along the Mohawk River at Little Falls, the West Canada Creek at Hinckley and Kast Bridge, and the Sacandaga River at Hope.  Moderate flooding also occurred on the Hudson River at Fort Edward, Hadley, and North Creek; the Schroon River at Riverbank; and the Mohawk River at Delta Dam.  Although river rises and some impacts occurred prior to midnight, the crests occurred on 1 November, and impacts persisted into the first week of November in some areas (see also November StormData). The flooding was extensive over portions of the area, damaging and destroying numerous roads and structures and resulting in water rescues. Between 150 and 200 people were evacuated in Herkimer County. The number of dwellings damaged by the flooding was 344, of which 135 sustained major damage, and 18 were destroyed. There was one fatality as a result of the flooding as a man was swept away by flood waters when he exited his vehicle. ||As a result of the flooding, a major disaster for the state of New York was requested by Governor Cuomo and approved by the President. The monetary damages for public infrastructure requested for the Mohawk Valley and southern Adirondacks totaled around $17 million ($1.2 million for Fulton County, $3.0 million for Hamilton County, $8.8 million for Herkimer County, $0.5 million for Montgomery, $1.6 million for Saratoga, and $1.9 million for Warren). Actual damage amounts were estimated to be even higher by county emergency managers. A state of emergency was declared for Dutchess, Herkimer, Hamilton, Saratoga, and Warren Counties, and boil water notices were issued in Herkimer, Hamilton, and Warren Counties due to floodwater inundation of private and public water systems. The American Red Cross opened shelters to house those displaced by flood damage. ||Other impacts from the flooding and high winds included the cancellation of Amtrak service between Syracuse and Albany due to high water encroaching on train tracks, and portions of the Adirondack Park backcountry becoming impassable due to bridge washouts, high water at stream crossings, and downed trees and debris on trails and at trailheads.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The shoulder of Military Road in Norway collapsed due to flood waters.

As the front effectively stalled in a west-to-east line along the Interstate 40 corridor, showers and storms continued to redevelop and move across the same areas. With rainfall rates approaching 1-2 per hour at times, this led to widespread flash flooding across Humphreys, Dickson, Cheatham, Davidson, Wilson, Smith, Jackson, Putnam, and Overton Counties. This flooding resulted in numerous closed roadways, dozens of water rescues, flooded homes and businesses, significant rises on area creeks and rivers, and unfortunately one fatality in Cheatham County. Total rainfall amounts ranged from 3 inches to nearly 7 inches across these counties. In addition to the flooding, thunderstorms produced two EF-0 tornadoes in Rutherford and Wilson Counties.

Widely scattered thunderstorms began forming around 1 PM CST along and west of Highway 183. By 2 PM CST, a persistent line segment of thunderstorms began affecting western Dawson county. Over the following four hours, this southwest-northeast oriented line slowly crept east across Dawson county into western Buffalo county, with its southwest end moving from Gosper county into Phelps county. A downburst occurred in Cozad where winds were measured at 63 mph. Further east, trees were damaged near Elm Creek. This line of storms subsequently weakened as it moved into eastern Buffalo county. However, between 5 and 9 PM CST, numerous small thunderstorms formed over Gosper, Furnas, Phelps, and Harlan counties. Storms kept forming over these counties until a multi-county area of persistent heavy rain enveloped these counties and expanded north to include Dawson and Buffalo counties. By 9 PM CST, the heaviest rain had morphed to the southeast side of a large, expanding rain shield, with a nearly stationary band stretching from southwest to northeast across Furnas, Phelps, and Buffalo counties. After 10 PM CST, a large squall line that had developed far to the west, over the high plains, began moving into south-central Nebraska. It brought a third period of heavy rain to these counties, but its cold pool aided in shoving the training, slow-moving mass of heavy rain eastward. The two areas of rain merged with a progressive squall line subsequently advancing across the rest of the south central Nebraska. The squall line exited into southeast Nebraska by 230 AM CST. Severe downburst winds occurred a few spots with this squall line. A few tree limbs were snapped off in Oxford and Kearney, and 36 power poles were snapped off over a 2-mile stretch southeast of Holdrege. The highest rainfall total reported was 10.65 inches 3 miles southwest of Odessa. The second highest was 8.88 inches in Loomis. 8.33 fell near Hildreth, 7.66 in Riverdale, 7.60 near Lexington, 6.50 near Cozad, 5.90 near Minden, and 5.64 on the southwest side of Kearney.||Late in the afternoon, a few thunderstorms moved north from Kansas ahead of the storms west of Highway 183. These storms produced some spotty tree damage in Webster and Kearney counties, and damage two livestock sheds in the town of Ayr. A brief rope tornado was also reported near Roseland. ||At the surface, a stalled front extended from the Mid-Atlantic states west to the southern Kansas border. Throughout the day, this front gradually lifted north as a warm front. Meanwhile, low pressure over eastern Colorado moved into northwest Kansas, joining the western end of the front. In the upper-levels weak southwest flow was over Nebraska with a longwave trough advancing eastward through the western U.S., and a ridge over the Upper Midwest. An embedded shortwave trough moved out of Colorado and crossed Nebraska, creating a favorable environment for thunderstorms. As the initial thunderstorms developed, the environment was characterized by surface temperatures in the lower to middle 80s, with dewpoints in the lower 70s. Mid-level lapse rates were poor, but despite that, MLCAPE was 2500-3000 J/kg. Deep layer shear was weak at less than 20 kt. Precipitable water values were around 1.70 inches, which was close to a record. ||The excessive rainfall resulted in flash flooding in parts of Dawson, Gosper, Furnas, Harlan, Phelps, and Buffalo counties, including flooding across parts of U.S. Highways 6, 30, 183, and 283. Numerous gravel county roads were inundated by flood waters and impassible. Many of them were severely damaged. Roads in the city of Kearney were flooded from one curb to the other, and in at least two separate places, water was 3 to 4 ft deep. Almost 40 vehicles were stranded in Kearney streets. Basements were flooded in some homes due to egress windows breaking. The student union was flooded on the University of Nebraska campus in Kearney. Two to three feet of water was reported in the lower level of the food court. In Lexington, cars were stalled in flood waters and 23 people were evacuated from an apartment building due to flooding. The Red Cross opened a shelter to care for those evacuated.||In some areas, the impacts worsened the following day as creeks swelled out of their banks. Gibbon, Kearney, Odessa, Elm Creek, and Lexington were all severely impacted. U.S. highway 30 was closed due to floodwater from Shelton to Kearney to Elm Creek, as well as near Lexington. Turkey Creek drains into the North Channel of the Platte River, which runs through the south side of Kearney. Water rapidly rose on the south side of the city Tuesday morning, inundating numerous hotels, restaurants, businesses, and basements. At least 200 people had to be evacuated from hotels using construction grade front-end loaders. Approximately 100 other nearby residents needed to be evacuated as well. At its peak, water was 2 to 4 feet high inside the hotels, and 4 to 5 feet high in the parking lots. The water rose so quickly that many people staying at the hotels did not have time to move their vehicles. Most vehicles at the hotels were a total loss. Hundreds of vehicles in the city had to be towed. Some businesses were closed for weeks, others for months, as repairs and remodeling were completed. Kitchen equipment was ruined at some restaurants. Of the 1800 hotels rooms in Kearney, only about 600 were available for use because first floor services, such as check-in desks, laundry facilities, and kitchens were damaged. Stagecoach souvenir shop lost 2,000 pounds of merchandise. Second avenue, which is the main north-south thoroughfare through the city, was closed from Interstate 80 to 11th avenue. The Interstate 80 off ramp was also closed. All traffic to and from the Interstate, from the city, had to use the Kearney East Expressway. Approximately 400 Kearney homes were damaged by the flood, and many more beyond city limits. Just as one example, an egress window gave way in a home on the southeast side of Kearney. Water rushed into the basement, filling it nearly to the ceiling. Extensive flooding resulted in the closure of Yanney Park. A power substation flooded and resulted in power outages to about 450 customers. Flood waters began to subside Wednesday, July 10th, which allowed for one lane of 2nd avenue to be reopened in each direction.||In Odessa, flooding was significant. Water was 4 feet deep on Webb street. A little further south, the Odessa exit from Interstate 80 was closed because of significant flooding. Water was about 3 feet deep at the truck stop adjacent to the Interstate. Semi trucks and cars pulled into the truck stop due to the heavy rain Monday evening, but by 630 AM CST Tuesday, water was up to the top of the wheel wells on several semi's. Flooded vehicles had to be towed. The Platte River, which is very wide and shallow, rose 3 feet in 12 hours from 6 PM CST Monday to 6 AM CST Tuesday, and 4 feet in 24 hours. It is very difficult for the Platte River to flood, but it crested at 8.3 feet at 515 PM CST Tuesday. Flood stage is 7 feet.||In the town of Elm Creek, many roads and basements were flooded. A gauge on Elm Creek indicated that the water level rose 8 feet in 2 hours Monday evening.||The city of Lexington issued a disaster declaration due to the disruption of utility services. Streets and homes were flooded with sewers backing up into homes. ||Flooding was extensive along the Wood River. Moderate flooding occurred at Riverdale with water covering the bridge just north of town. Further to the north, flooding forced the closure of state highway 10 between Pleasanton and Hazard.||In Gibbon, water flooded streets and basements for the second time this year. The northeast side of town was impacted the worst with at least 30 homes and several businesses inundated by floodwater. People had to sandbag their homes and businesses. It is believed that flooding on the Wood River was wider with this event, due to changes in the riverbed from the prior flood in March. Some places that did not flood in that event, flooded this time. Many people commented, I can't believe this has happened twice. Several businesses affected by the March flood still remained closed due to damage.||Amtrak trains that travel between Chicago and Emeryville, CA were halted in Lincoln and McCook due to the flooding. There were probably many more impacts that were not documented here as it is not possible to include everything. Widespread flooding of low-lying areas, creeks, and rivers continued for several days following the excessive rain. Flood waters did not recede in some locations until Monday, July 15th. This devastating flood occurred just four months after a catastrophic flood occurred nearby in mid-to-late March. That flood affected areas primarily along and north of the Platte River.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 46 year old female from Eustis died from injuries sustained in an automobile accident when she encountered flood waters over Highway 21 approximately 4 miles south of Cozad.

The heaviest rain fell over Sioux and Emmons counties, where there were multiple reports of over four inches of rain. In Sioux County, on the Standing Rock Nation, flash flooding from the heavy rain resulted in a section of BIA Road 3, locally known as the Kenel Road, being washed out at the crossing with Joe Bush Creek. The culvert washed out and the road collapsed. Four vehicles drove into the washout and resulted in two fatalities and two injuries.

The survivors were the 33-year-old male driver and a 2-year-old boy. Two young boys aged 5 and 8 years old were killed. The location of the flash flood fatalities was in a hilly area, where numerous low water crossings are prone to frequent inundation. A volunteer firefighter familiar with the area estimated the water depth was 3 to 4 feet where the driver of the SUV attempted to cross the creek. The injured victims were airlifted or taken by ambulance to regional hospitals with moderate to serious injuries. The victims were all members of the same family. In the second incident, a truck was swept away at the low water crossing of Upper Whitewater Creek on County Road 234. This location is a couple miles east of Sedgwickville. The 48-year-old male driver from Louisiana was killed. The vehicle was found upside down in the water.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An upper level disturbance ejecting northeast ahead of the trough across portions of East Texas and North Louisiana during the early morning hours of April 13th carried enough elevated instability, shear, and forcing north of an advancing warm front over Southeast Texas and South Louisiana, such that scattered strong to severe thunderstorms developed, with numerous reports of large hail and occasional damaging winds received. The warm front continued to gradually mix north northwest into East Texas and Northcentral Louisiana by late morning and early afternoon hours, with a very warm, moist, and unstable air mass noted over Deep East Texas and portions of Northcentral Louisiana south of the front. Coupled with even stronger forcing and low level shear ahead of the approaching upper trough, additional strong to severe thunderstorms developed near and south of the front from late morning through the afternoon, producing several reports of damaging winds across portions of Northcentral Louisiana. These storms also produced locally heavy rainfall that led to instances of flash flooding, which resulted in two separate fatalities in Ouachita Parish. A 13 year old boy drowned in a drainage canal in the Bawcomville community during the heavy rains, and an 80 year old female drove past barricades on a closed road in Calhoun several hours after the heavy rains had ended, with her car becoming submerged in the flood waters. Unfortunately, she was unable to escape and drowned.  These showers and thunderstorms diminished by early evening with the departure of the trough, and the arrival of an associated cold front which brought about cooler, drier, and more stable air southeast into the region.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A 13 year old boy drowned in floodwaters in a drainage canal on Evergreen Street just past the Boys and Girls Club in the Bawcomville community.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 0.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

During the onset of the heavier rainfall, a few storms caused wind damage near Tainter Lake and Colfax, but most of the damage was minor with a few large tree limbs and power lines blown down. ||Deep moisture convergence along the axis of thunderstorms, training along the periphery of the the numerous boundaries, combined with PWAT values of 1.7 to 1.9 inches which is over the 99th percentile value, caused extreme rainfall rates. ||Before the flash flooding event developed, there was an hour or two during Sunday evening that dropped locally one to two inches of rainfall in the areas that received more torrential rainfall in the early morning hours. ||There was one main band of excessive rainfall that occurred in west central Wisconsin during the early morning. This area was from Prescott, northeast toward River Falls and Baldwin. Based on the return period from precipitation amounts in a specific time frame, the values were a 100-200 year event. Flash flood guidance values were 1.5 to 2 times above normal.  ||As the runoff continued through the morning, the flash flood event become more areal flooding as the flood waters receded into creeks, streams, and eventually the mainstem rivers. Other areas that experienced flooding but not as significant include the New Richland Golf Course. The St. Croix County Sheriff Office documented the flood damage the next day from their drone. From the video, you could see numerous culverts and roads that were washed away including crop fields (near the creeks and streams) that were inundated nearly 24 hours after the initial rainfall started. ||Some of the higher rainfall totals around the area are as follows.||Emerald measured 9.84 inches.|Baldwin measured 8.72 inches. |River Falls measured 6.34 to 7.82 inches around the city. |Roberts measured 7.24 inches. |Menomonie measured 5.08 to 5.64 inches around the city.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Parts of St. Croix County received over 8 to 9 inches of rain causing flooding and washed out roads across the county. The worst areas that experienced significant flooding were the Kinnickinnic, Rush and Eau Galle Recreation River areas, and the towns of Hammond, Baldwin, Emerald, Glenwood City, and Cylon. ||Some of the specific roads that were closed or washed out during the height of the flooding were: 1000 Block of 190th Street in Baldwin, 2100 110th Avenue in Baldwin, Country Road TK, DD & 240th Street in Baldwin, Highway 12 & 220th Street in Baldwin Township, 2254 130th Avenue in Emerald, 2900 Block of 200th Avenue in Glenwood City, and West Blvd & Highway 65 in Roberts.||Unfortunately,  A man died after he lost control while driving on a water-covered road north of Baldwin near County Road E and Highway 63. At least five other motorists standing on the roofs of their cars were rescued from rushing water in that same location in the Baldwin area.||About $4 Million dollars in damages was due to 40 homes that sustained major damage and one that was destroyed when the foundation caved in. The other $4 Million dollars was due to bridge, highway and road damage.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 8.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The MCS produced widespread strong winds with localized damaging winds from individual microbursts across the region. The strong winds also generated dense blowing dust in southwest Arizona. In addition to the wind, storms were producing average rain rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour with briefly higher rates in the strongest cells. This led to flash flooding in multiple areas. The town of Gila Bend suffered catastrophic flash flooding after 2 to 4 inches of rain fell over a large portion of the basin containing Sand Tank and Bender Washes, which flow into Gila Bend. A breach of the canal in town due to erosion added to the flash flooding. Significant flow through the washes impacted numerous homes and businesses and there were 2 fatalities. A state of emergency was declared for this event.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Following 2 to 4 inches of rain in 1 to 2 hours over the Sand Tank Wash watershed, catastrophic flooding occurred in the small town of Gila Bend with feet of water, mud, and debris moving through town. Storm surveys were completed by NWS Phoenix, Maricopa County Department of Emergency Management (MCDEM), American Red Cross, and Flood Control District of Maricopa County (FCDMC). FCDMC gages on Sand Tank Wash, Bender Wash, and in the Maricopa Mountains measured rainfall amounts around 3 to 4 inches in 1 to 2 hours for an annual exceedance probability of 0.1%. FCDMC found the most significant floodwaters were within Sand Tank Wash, with lesser flows in Bender and Scott Avenue Washes. The NWS Phoenix survey found evidence of out of bank flooding in Sand Tank Wash 1 to 3 miles south of Interstate-8 (I-8) with 2 to 6 feet of water and sizable debris. The streamflow gage on Sand Tank Wash at I-8 reached alarm stage at 0157MST, bank full at 0341MST, and flood stage at 0352MST. The gage crested at 7.69 feet with 5000 cfs of flow at 0408MST. The floodwaters and debris that moved through town caused flood damage to at least 140 homes and 25 businesses. Most structures impacted were between the Gila Bend Canal and Main Street and then along Pima Street. During the flooding, Maricopa County Sheriff's Office rescued at least 30 individuals from their roofs along with others pulled from stranded vehicles. Photos after the water receded showed the canal was eroded and breached where Sand Tank Wash flows over it. Photos also showed 2 to 5 foot water lines both on the outside and inside of many of the structures, piles of debris, damaged property and vehicles, and erosion. Of the homes MCDEM assessed, 21 were deemed uninhabitable after the flooding. Unfortunately there were 2 direct fatalities with this event. One made a heroic effort to save a stranded motorist before they themselves were swept away in their own vehicle. The other was swept away in one of the flooded washes. Additionally, many farm animals were killed. Besides the fatalities, no other injuries were reported. A state of emergency was declared for this event.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A warm front moved northward into Middle Tennessee early on March 27 before stalling near the I-40 corridor. Between 300-400 AM CDT, numerous showers and thunderstorms developed along the warm front, many of which became severe and produced large hail up to half dollar size along with frequent lightning and heavy rainfall. Showers and storms continued off and on the rest of the day across Middle Tennessee, particularly near the stalled warm front. In fact, another round of severe thunderstorms including supercells developed during the afternoon and evening hours near and south of the warm front. These storms dropped large hail up to tennis ball size and caused a few reports of wind damage, but the main impact was additional heavy rainfall which began causing flash flooding south of Nashville. Flooding only worsened as showers and storms redeveloped over the same areas through the evening, with numerous Flash Flood Warnings issued and several reports of flooded roads and water rescues.||After midnight, even more heavy rainfall falling along the already waterlogged I-40 corridor prompted a rare Flash Flood Emergency for the southern and eastern Nashville metro area, including southeastern Davidson County, western Wilson County, and northern Williamson County. These areas received between 7 to 9 of rain, causing rapid rises on several Nashville metro creeks and streams, including Sevenmile Creek (which reached its highest level on record), Browns Creek, and Mill Creek, among others. Many of these creeks reached within their 2nd or 3rd highest water levels on record. The rapid water rises flooded hundreds of homes and businesses, with reports of some people trapped in the attics or on the roofs of their houses. Dozens of roadways were flooded and impassable, including both I-24 and I-40, with many cars submerged in the flood waters and people forced to cling onto trees to avoid getting swept away. Although the flood waters receded quickly on Sunday, March 28, many area rivers reached flood stage in the week after the event, including the Cumberland River, Harpeth River, and Duck River.||A total of 7 deaths were reported from the flooding across Middle Tennessee, with 5 in Davidson County, 1 in Cheatham County, and 1 in Maury County. Emergency management reports indicate over 500 homes and businesses were flooded, and a Presidential Disaster Proclamation was declared for many counties in May 2021. This flash flood event was the worst seen in Middle Tennessee since the May 1-2, 2010 flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Significant flash flooding affected far northern Maury County. A woman attempting to clear debris blocking a drainage culvert on her property at 6415 Leipers Creek Road was swept through the culvert and drowned. Several roads were flooded and closed, including Fairview Road at Les Robinson Road west of Spring Hill, and Duplex Road between Highway 31 and Miles Johnson Parkway in Spring Hill. Flood waters also reportedly covered the parking lot of Walmart in Spring Hill on Highway 31.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 334.90K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several reports of large hail was received across central and eastern New Mexico, and a few tornadoes and landspouts were observed across the plains. The anomalously moist air mass allowed for heavy rain to fall as well, especially across south central and southeast New Mexico which received rainfall totals of three to five inches in a very short period of time. This led to flash flooding in Lincoln and Chaves counties in which several water rescues had to be performed. Widespread damage was reported as well with multiple businesses, homes, and vehicles being inundated with flood waters. Tragically, one individual in southern Lincoln County drowned while trying to cross a flooded roadway in their vehicle.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Heavy rainfall in the Hondo area caused widespread flooding of roads and low water crossings.

One individual was in their truck at Alamo Canyon Road and became stuck in the low water crossing when the flood waters inundated it. The individual then either tried to escape or the flood waters pulled them out of their truck. Tragically, they drowned, and their body was found the next day.

A warm front moved northward into Middle Tennessee early on March 27 before stalling near the I-40 corridor. Between 300-400 AM CDT, numerous showers and thunderstorms developed along the warm front, many of which became severe and produced large hail up to half dollar size along with frequent lightning and heavy rainfall. Showers and storms continued off and on the rest of the day across Middle Tennessee, particularly near the stalled warm front. In fact, another round of severe thunderstorms including supercells developed during the afternoon and evening hours near and south of the warm front. These storms dropped large hail up to tennis ball size and caused a few reports of wind damage, but the main impact was additional heavy rainfall which began causing flash flooding south of Nashville. Flooding only worsened as showers and storms redeveloped over the same areas through the evening, with numerous Flash Flood Warnings issued and several reports of flooded roads and water rescues.||After midnight, even more heavy rainfall falling along the already waterlogged I-40 corridor prompted a rare Flash Flood Emergency for the southern and eastern Nashville metro area, including southeastern Davidson County, western Wilson County, and northern Williamson County. These areas received between 7 to 9 of rain, causing rapid rises on several Nashville metro creeks and streams, including Sevenmile Creek (which reached its highest level on record), Browns Creek, and Mill Creek, among others. Many of these creeks reached within their 2nd or 3rd highest water levels on record. The rapid water rises flooded hundreds of homes and businesses, with reports of some people trapped in the attics or on the roofs of their houses. Dozens of roadways were flooded and impassable, including both I-24 and I-40, with many cars submerged in the flood waters and people forced to cling onto trees to avoid getting swept away. Although the flood waters receded quickly on Sunday, March 28, many area rivers reached flood stage in the week after the event, including the Cumberland River, Harpeth River, and Duck River.||A total of 7 deaths were reported from the flooding across Middle Tennessee, with 5 in Davidson County, 1 in Cheatham County, and 1 in Maury County. Emergency management reports indicate over 500 homes and businesses were flooded, and a Presidential Disaster Proclamation was declared for many counties in May 2021. This flash flood event was the worst seen in Middle Tennessee since the May 1-2, 2010 flood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Major and historic flash flooding affected southern and eastern Davidson County, with the worst flooding affecting areas along and near Sevenmile Creek and Mill Creek in south Nashville. Hundreds of homes and businesses were flooded, numerous roadways were flooded and closed including I-24, I-40, and I-440, and over 130 water rescues were conducted from people stranded in flooded vehicles and homes. Homes and businesses that were flooded included a hotel at 95 Wallace Road near I-24 at Harding Place, the South Brooke Apartments on Linbar Drive, many homes around Edmondson Pike at Blackman Road, the Walmart on Nolensville Pike at Harding Place with vehicles in the parking lot submerged up to their windows, a home on Truxton Court in Donelson, and the Kroger on Old Hickory Blvd in Hermitage which also had cars stalled in flood waters in the parking lot. Residents were trapped and rescued from the second stories of homes on Paragon Mills Road, and the attics of homes on Currey Road and also on Suter Drive near Edmondson Pike. Other people were rescued clinging to trees or in flood waters in the 400 block of Hogan Road, on Milner Drive, and in the 400 block of Harding Place. Interstate 24 near Antioch Pike was submerged with many vehicles stranded and around one dozen drivers rescued, and Interstate 40 and Interstate 440 were also flooded in a few areas. Other roads that were flooded and impassable included Rosa Parks Blvd near the Farmers Market, Highway 70 near White Bridge Road, Dodson Chapel Road, Tulip Grove Road, and Chandler Road. A total of 5 people were killed, 3 of which were swept away from a homeless camp along Sevenmile Creek near Edmondson Pike at Nolensville Pike. Another man drowned when he left his submerged vehicle and was swept away near the Nashboro Village Golf Course at Nashboro Blvd at Flintlock Court, and another man drowned in his vehicle behind the Walmart near Harding Place at Nolensville Pike.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The high rainfall rates associated with these later storms produced localized flash flooding in Coos County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Two consecutive thunderstorms rolled into Lancaster and Jefferson between 1030 PM and 1130 PM on the evening of the 25th. These fairly discrete thunderstorms were fairly small, but produced torrential rainfall with high rates of precipitation. Radar estimates the storms peaked around 11 PM where it dropped an estimated 0.75��� in 15 minutes.  Even total rainfall was approaching near 1.75.  North Road washed out one lane at sharp curve near Gore Rd in Lancaster, NH. Approximately 20ft of lane missing, another 30ft undermined. A tributary of the Garland Brook came out of banks and produced the washout. Minor injuries to the driver in the car that drove into the water-covered washout and down into the ditch.  Another washout was very close at Brook Road due to a failed culvert, also in Lancaster.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20.00K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Ida turned north and northeast across central Mississippi during late afternoon and evening on Monday, August 30th.||The core of the hurricane force winds was relatively small, only extending out from the center about 50 miles. However tropical storm force winds extended outward over 150 miles from the center. This brought tropical storm force wind gusts to southeast Mississippi and much of southwest Alabama, with a brief period of sustained tropical storm force winds to coastal Alabama. Wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph were recorded across southeast Mississippi and southwestern Alabama. The tropical storm force winds also downed several trees across the area.||The highest storm surge inundation values observed were between 3 to 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. Storm surge surveys indicated the highest water levels were in the Bayou La Batre area along and near Shell Belt Road where peak water levels were in the 4 to 4.5 feet MHHW range.||The slow movement of the storm caused widespread flooding especially across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. Rainfall amounts of anywhere from 7 to 12 inches were recorded across southeast Mississippi and portions of southwest Alabama. This led to significant flash flooding along with significant river flooding.||Two tornadoes during the afternoon on August 30th. An EF-1 in northern Mobile County and an EF-1 in southern Clarke County.||Here is a breakdown of county impacts:||Stone County MS: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed several trees in Stone|County. Seven to ten inches of rain was recorded and one road had to be barricaded due to flooding. The low lying red creek and mill creek areas experienced flooding, impacting two RV parks.||George County MS: Eight to twelve inches of rain fell across George county which|resulted in significant flash flooding. A portion of Highway 26 collapsed just west of Lucedale, killing three people and injuring seven others. Eleven other roads were significantly flooded and had some form of washout or damage.||Mobile County AL: The west end of Dauphin Island was significantly impacted by Ida|from a combination of high surf, storm surge, and tropical storm force winds. Three miles of Bienville boulevard was impassable due to surge flooding and sand up to four feet deep. The high surf also produced minor damage to a few homes on the west end. Power poles were also knocked down on the island. Storm surge inundation peaked|between 3 and 4.5 feet MHHW across southern Mobile county up into the far north end of Mobile Bay. The highest tidal gauge readings were 3.78 feet MHHW at Coast Guard sector Mobile and 3.82 feet MHHW at the Bayou La Batre bridge. Storm surge surveys along Shell Belt road in Bayou La Batre indicated water lines that reached between 4-4.5 feet.||This surge flooding resulted in closures of low lying coastal roads, such as Shell Belt road, the US Highway 90 causeway, the foot of the Dog river bridge, and the Dauphin Island causeway. Coastal flooding persisted across three high tide cycles which resulted in prolonged closures. Observations at Dauphin Island and Buccaneer Yacht Club on|Mobile Bay measured brief sustained periods of tropical storm force winds between 40-45 mph. Gusts of 50 to 60 mph were recorded in heavier rain bands across central and southern Mobile county. An EF-1 tornado impacted parts of Saraland, Satsuma, and Creola early in the afternoon on August 30th, resulting in three injuries. Rainfall|totals of 8 to 11 inches were recorded across the county, especially in southern and central portions. This heavy rainfall led to some urban flooding in neighborhoods and damaged some drainage culverts.||Baldwin County AL: Storm surge inundation of 3 to 4 feet above normally dry ground was recorded from Weeks Bay northward. This resulted in flooding of low lying areas and closure of the US Highway 90 Causeway. Five to nine inches of rain was measured across Baldwin county, which resulted in areas of flash flooding. A portion of River Road along Styx River was washed out due to heavy rainfall and flooding. A few drainage culverts were also significant damaged in the county. Tropical storm conditions were confined primarily to immediate coastal areas, particularly along the Fort Morgan peninsula.||Clarke County AL: An EF-1 Tornado impacted portions of southern Clarke County, significantly damaging a couple of structures.||Escambia County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand on coastal roadways along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for an extended period of time.||Santa Rosa County FL: High surf of at least ten feet resulted in significant flooding and sand along the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Portions of the road and access areas were closed for and extended period of time.||Okaloosa County FL: Strong rip currents produced by Ida resulted in two rip current fatalities in the wake of the storm. One occurred on September 1st when a 14 year old teen drowned off a Destin Beach. The other fatality occurred on September 4th when a 58 year old man drowned off Henderson Beach State Park.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Very heavy rainfall with 2 inch per hour rain rates fell over very saturated conditions and resulted in additional flash flooding. This resulted in the collapse of a portion of Highway 26 near Crossroads Road. Several vehicles drove into a 50 foot deep hole. Three people were killed and seven others were injured.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.80M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Over the course of just a few hours, a wide swath of 6-10 inches of rain occurred. Numerous roads became submerged and impassable. Countless water rescues were performed as travelers either became trapped by or drove into flood waters. Flood water several feet deep impacted parts of neighborhoods and townhomes. Several businesses were damaged by flooding. Extreme runoff also caused creeks and other waterways to rapidly swell. There was at least one report of a partial landslide in Pelham, sending dirt, rocks, and pine trees onto the road. A Flash Flood Watch had already been in place for a few days, highlighting the potential for flooding rainfall. A Flash Flood Warning was issued for north Shelby County early in the evening. At least four rounds of thunderstorms occurred, with ongoing and forecast impacts pushing the event to the highest level of flash flooding, a Flash Flood Emergency. Scanner traffic became nonstop with public calls for help and first responder needs for mutual aid and resources. Even after the rain subsided later in the evening hours,|flooding persisted for several more hours.

A fast-moving flood wave traveling westward down Trace Creek caused flood waters to rise several feet in roughly a 10 minute timespan between 1000am to 1010am CDT, flooding hundreds of homes, businesses, and churches, some of which were washed off their foundations. News reports and information from the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency indicated a total of 523 homes were impacted by the flooding, with 272 totally destroyed, 168 with major damage, 31 with minor damage, and 20 affected. 44 businesses and 8 public facilities were also damaged, including the Waverly Elementary School and Waverly Junior High School which will have to be torn down are rebuilt in a different location. Dozens of cars were also washed away and deposited long distances downstream, and many of the roadway bridges than spanned Trace Creek were knocked off their pilings and heavily damaged. TEMA reported damage to roads and schools alone totaled $31,844,911, with an additional estimated $60-70 million in damage to homes and businesses. 19 people were killed in Waverly, along with 1 other who died in Hurricane Mills, making this the deadliest flash flood in Middle Tennessee history.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This was in addition to a small area of 5-10 inch amounts that fell across portions of the southern North Carolina mountains during the morning of the 16th. The result of this rainfall was significant to catastrophic flash flooding across portions of the French Broad and Pigeon River basins, including some of the worst flooding to impact these areas in almost 20 years. The most severe flooding occurred in portions of southern and central Haywood County, where a number of fatalities and hundreds of millions of dollars and damage occurred.

Flash flooding initially developed along the West Fork and especially the East Fork of the Pigeon River. Water from the latter stream, swept downstream through the Cruso community causing widespread damage. Six people were killed in Cruso, four of them in a campground along the East Fork, where numerous recreational vehicles and automobiles were swept away. Water from the two forks of the river rushed downstream to the main channel of the Pigeon, causing major flooding along the stream in Canton and Clyde for the first time since Tropical Cyclone Ivan in September 2004. Numerous buildings in downtown Canton were inundated. In total, around 700 homes were impacted by flooding, with a couple of hundred of those destroyed. Numerous vehicles were also swept away or otherwise damaged and hundreds of people were rescued.

On August 26th, the wave developed into a tropical depression, which organized further and became Tropical Storm Ida later that day, near Grand Cayman. On a northwestward track, Ida intensified into a hurricane on August 27, just before moving over western Cuba. A day later, the hurricane underwent rapid intensification over the Gulf of Mexico as it passed over a warm core eddy and reached major hurricane strength. It was just under 72 hours from tropical depression formation to category 4 strength with 150 mph winds. Ida remained at its peak intensity of 150 mph winds and a minimum central pressure of 929 millibars as it made landfall near Port Fourchon midday on August 29th. It didn���t weaken to a tropical storm until it reached near the Louisiana/Mississippi border. ||Ida produced extensive to catastrophic damage across southeast Louisiana. On Grand Isle, around 40% of the structures were destroyed and the island was uninhabitable. Near 75% of the structures in Lafourche Parish were damaged or destroyed and likely similar numbers in Terrebonne Parish. 100+ mph wind gusts reached as far inland as Interstate 12. These winds damaged more than 30,000 poles, over 36,000 spans of wire and nearly 6,000 transformers. Of those more than 30,000 Louisiana poles, nearly 80% of those broken or damaged are from the most heavily impacted areas.|In total, the number of damaged or destroyed poles from Ida is more than hurricanes Katrina, Ike, Delta and Zeta combined. Due to major destruction to the power grid across the region, over 1 million customers were without power after landfall. Some of those power outages near the Louisiana coast lasted for around 4 weeks. |||The Louisiana Department of Health reported 3 direct fatalities and 28 indirect fatalities. Excessive heat and carbon monoxide poisoning were the most common causes of death. Indirect injuries associated with Ida: 351 heat-related, 183 carbon monoxide exposure, and 3 electrocutions. Storm surge ranged from a few feet to 10 to 15 feet. Hurricane Ida caused approximately $30 billion worth of damage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Significant street flooding occurred in a few parts of the parish, though no homes were reported to take on water.
