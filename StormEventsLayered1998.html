This intense convection developed well ahead of a strong cold front.  The storms resulted in one fatality and three injuries.  An elderly man was instantly killed at Ellenville in Ulster County, when a large tree limb fell on him.  Two injuries occurred in Fulton County and one injury in Montgomery County.  The injuries were the result of fallen tree limbs and wires.  Across the region the damaging winds knocked out power to approximately 40,000 customers, broke several power poles and damaged dozens of homes due to fallen trees or large branches.  Damage was most widespread in Montgomery, Fulton, Saratoga, Warren and Washington Counties.  State Highway 9N south of Bolton Landing in Warren County and route 4 in the Whitehall area in northern Washington County, were closed through the evening hours due to tree debris.  At North Winfield in southern Herkimer County, a silo collapsed in the damaging winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> .5K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Three tornadoes were also sighted. Storms first developed in Kay County during the late morning where a semi-truck was blown over 1.5 miles southwest of Blackwell near the intersection of Highway 11 and Interstate 35. Severe thunderstorms then redeveloped over Major and Blaine Counties a few hours later. As these storms moved east into Garfield County, a tornado was spotted 3 miles south of Waukomis moving east. This tornado, rated an F1, knocked down or snapped 40 to 50 power poles, damaged several outbuildings, and destroyed numerous trees. One large diesel storage tank was picked up and desposited one-half mile away. A pickup truck containing 2 occupants was also picked up a short distance from the road and dropped on the side of the road near a creek. Both occupants were uninjured. A semi-trailer was also blown off the highway. As the tornado dissipated, severe thunderstorm winds blew down large tree limbs in Bison, and lightning from the same complex of thunderstorms struck a house in Enid, causing a short in the wiring, which then started a small house fire. Large tree limbs were also downed in Seiling in Dewey County, while a rain gutter from a house was ripped off by the winds 12 miles east of Hennessey in Kingfisher County breaking several flower pots. Large tree limbs were also downed in the same location.As the thunderstorms moved into Logan County, Oklahoma Mesonet measured wind gusts of 59 mph and 66 mph at 1620 CST and 1630 CST respectively 3 miles southeast of Marshall. A weak, F0 tornado was then spotted 9 miles north of Crescent, just west of State Highway 74. The tornado uprooted several trees while crossing the highway, then quickly dissipated. Another weak tornado, an F0, was spotted on the Blaine/Dewey County border 2 miles west of Canton, knocking down trees and power poles. The same thunderstorm was responsible for a lightning strike at the Old Christian Church in Eagle City in Blaine County causing a fire that destroyed the church. As these storms moved east, thunderstorm winds damaged a fence, silo, and several trees in Logan County 3 miles southwest of Langston. Several power poles were blown down 1 mile north of Loyal in Kingfisher County, while in the city of Loyal 13 power poles were snapped, and large tree limbs were blown down. Widespread wind damage occurred in the city of Kingfisher consisting of downed trees and power lines over a 12 square block area on the northwest side of the city. The garage of a house also shifted causing roof damage. Oklahoma Mesonet measured wind gusts of 63 mph and 80 mph at 1900 CST and 1905 CST respectively 4 miles southwest of Guthrie in Logan County. Straight-line winds then produced a large swath of damage to mobile homes, house roofs, trees, power poles and power lines in a 4 by 6 mile area across southern Logan County bounded by Western Ave to the west, Interstate 35 to the east, Forest Hills Road to the north, and Waterloo Road to the south. The worst damage occurred in a 1/2 by 1 1/2 mile area near Oak Cliff. Two-hundred fifty residents were damaged. Of these, 10 homes and business building were destroyed, while 41 structures suffered major damage. One hundred sixty-one single family homes, 43 mobile homes, 7 businesses, and 1 apartment complex suffered minor structural damage. Total damage estimates were near 3.5 million dollars. Five persons were injured, consisting mostly of broken fingers and cuts. No one was seriously injured. Lightning also struck an oil tank at Pine and Industrial in Guthrie, starting a fire that was quickly extinguised.Unusually strong straight-line winds also left a swath of damage roughly 8 miles long and 2 miles wide from just east of Jones in eastern Oklahoma County, east-southeast into extreme western Lincoln County 3 miles northeast of Harrah. A two year-old boy was killed, and ten persons were injured, 8 of which were transported to local hospitals. Damage was estimated at about 2 million dollars. Damage was intermittent from east of Jones to north of Horseshoe Lake and was limited mainly to fallen tree limbs. A more persistent area of wind damage about 1.5 miles wide was found from near Luther Road and Wilshire southeast to near the county line and Northeast 50th. Widespread tree damage occurred in this area along with structural damage to several homes. By far the most concentrated area of damage was along a half-mile wide swath from Harrah Road and 63rd extending east-southeast. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed in this area, one of which disintegrated with the frame left wrapped around a tree. All of the destroyed mobile homes were perpendicular to the wind or nearly so and thus were hit broadside by the full force of the wind. The level of damage in this swath is estimated at strong F1 suggesting that maximum winds probably were between 100 and 110 mph.Damage in Lincoln County consisted of downed power lines, uprooted trees, and damaged outbuildings in a half-mile wide by one-mile long swath just north of Highway 62. One barn also disintegrated as it was picked up by the wind and carried nearly one-quarter of a mile. In total, 75 homes were damaged; 11 suffered major damage, and six (All mobile homes) were destroyed. Three mobile homes were found to be totally disintegrated and one other that was rolled from its foundation. Several eyewitness reports indicated that at least some of these mobile homes were airborne while or just before they were destroyed. The fatality, and most of the injuries, were residents who were in the destroyed mobile homes when the winds struck. The last report of damage in Lincoln County occurred in Chandler, where lightning struck numerous transformers and power poles, knocking out power to all of Chandler for 5 hours.Severe thunderstorm winds also downed trees, wires, and numerous power poles all across the city of Edmond in Oklahoma County. Seven thousand residents were left without power for several hours. One tree fell on a car, and the canopy was blown off at Juffy Lube on 2nd Street, east of Bryant. Farther south and east, a tree was blown down near the Mazzio's Pizza on State Highway in Cushing in Payne County; highway signs and numerous trees were downed near Highway 44 in Cleveland County 4 miles west of Moore, and trees and power lines were blown down in Norman, also in Cleveland County. Lightning struck an oil tank battery in Slaughterville in Cleveland County, causing a fire that burned for about 1 hour before being extinguished. A mobile home was blown off its foundation and destroyed in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County. Five persons were inside the home including 3 children who were injured from minor cuts and bruises. The roof was also blown off of a boathouse at Shawnee Lake, also in Pottawatomie County. Numerous Numerous power lines were downed 8 miles east of Pauls Valley in Garvin County knocking out power to 500 residents, while a house sustained significant roof damage from strong winds. Rain poured into the house causing an estimated $20,000 in damage. Power lines and large tree limbs were downed in Wewoka in Seminole County and Holdenville in Hughes County. Lastly, Lightning struck a tree in Sulphur in Murray County, killing 3 cows and an angus bull standing under it.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 35K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The result was organized severe thunderstorm activity in the form of several bow echoes and squall lines.       A line of severe thunderstorms first entered the northern Finger Lakes region shortly before 130 pm EDT.  A fatality occurred in Syracuse as this line of storms passed through.  A man was struck by a large tree limb while out walking.  Many large trees and power lines littered streets in northern and eastern portions of the Syracuse metropolitan area in the wake of the thunderstorms.  This same line of storms also grew back to the west and southwest and produced large hail to one inch in diameter across Cayuga and Seneca counties.  Later that afternoon, the line of severe thunderstorms maintained its intensity and interacted with smaller line echo wave pattern features to produce a solid axis of damaging thunderstorms across New York's southern tier and the Catskills.  An area from northern Broome county to southern Chenango county and into Otsego county likely sustained the most damage.  Wind gusts estimated at close to 90 mph toppled trees and power lines in their path.  Many roads were closed for a time in the Plymouth and Oxford areas of Chenango county due to fallen trees.       By 530 pm EDT, the severe thunderstorms had moved either into the eastern Catskills or northeastern Pennsylvania.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A line of thunderstorms became severe as it crossed northern sections of the county close to 1:30 pm EDT.

Winds were estimated between 80 and 100 mph throughout the two hour event. Along the entire path, damage and debris all laid in an easterly direction consistent with the damage from straight-line winds. Most of the damage consisted of downed trees and limbs. The falling trees and limbs in turn downed power and telephone lines and resulted in damage to buildings and automobiles. Power outages, some lasting nearly a week, were widespread across parts of Orleans, Monroe and Wayne counties. Hundreds of thousands of customers were without power. The strong winds themselves also resulted in structural damage to homes, barns and buildings along the path including some in Lydonville, Albion, Holley, Brockport, Bushnells Basin, Macedon and Clyde. Several aircraft were damaged at the Rochester Airport where wind gusts were measured at 89 mph. States of Emergency were declared throughout Monroe and Wayne counties and sections of Orleans county. Monroe, Wayne and Cayuga counties were declared federal disaster areas. The strong winds severely damaged apple crops and trees from Niagara across Orleans and Monroe through Wayne counties.

The strongest tornado, an F3, occurred near Lamont in Grant County. There were also reports of hail up to 3.5 inches in diameter, straight line wind damage, and flooding. The first tornado, an F0, touched down in an open field 1 mile south of Amorita in Alfalfa County at 1745 CST lasting for less than one minute with no reports of damage. The second tornado, also an F0, was reported 5 minutes later by media chasers to have touched down in an open field 3 miles east northeast of Amorita. Touchdown was very brief with no damage reported. The third tornado was also observed by media chasers, this time in northeast Alfalfa County 8 miles east of Amorita. The tornado, an F1, damaged one house and knocked down power lines as it moved southeast and weakened while crossing into western Grant County for a total damage path lengh of 5 miles. There were no reports of damage with this segment of the tornado in Grant County and thus was rated an F0. An unusual aspect of this tornado was that it was reported to be rotating anticyclonically. The fourth and fifth tornadoes were also rated F0, the fourth reported by media chasers to have touched down in an open field 4 west northwest of Wakita with no damage, and the fifth observed by Wakita Fire Department to be on the ground for 2.5 miles from 2 miles southwest of Wakita to 2 miles south of Wakita. No damage was reported. An off-duty National Weather Service meteorologist observed the sixth tornado, an F0, in an open field 9 miles west of Medford. The seventh tornado, also an F0, produced no damage as it rotated anticyclonically 3 miles southeast of Wakita. The eighth and ninth tornadoes, both F0, occurred simultaneously 6 miles west of Medford. The eighth tornado touched down just north of Highway 11 while the ninth tornado touched down just south of Highway 11. One house and a business were damaged by the tenth tornado which occurred in Grant County from 2 miles southwest of Medford to 2 miles south of Medford.  The eleventh tornado, an F0, was observed by an off duty National Weather Service meteorologist to be knocking down trees and power lines in a 5 mile long damage path in southern Grant County. The twelvth tornado, an F1, snapped trees in half and damaged a private airstrip 4 miles east northeast of Pond Creek while the thirteenth tornado, also an F1, damaged several homes and knocked down trees and power lines 1 mile north of Salt Fork. The fourteenth tornado, an F0, was reported by spotters to have touched down briefly in an open field causing no damage.                          The most destructive tornado occurred near the city of Lamont where damage estimates reached 2 million dollars.  National Weather Service meteorologists conducted a survey of the area and found a damage path 5 1/4 miles long and 3/4 of a mile wide with F3 damage occurring 2 miles west of Lamont where a well-built brick home had all of its exterior walls destroyed. In addition, 6 single-family homes were destroyed 1.5 miles south of Lamont, while in the city of Lamont 3 single-family dwellings sustained major damage. Nine single-family homes sufferred minor damage. Nearly a dozen vehicles were destroyed, including automobiles, pickup trucks, farm trucks, and farm tractors. Several barns were destroyed including one barn where 30 sheep were also killed. More than 70 utility poles were ripped down in a 3 mile stretch. The Lamont tornado, as it is referred, was unusual in its direction of movement. Several eye witnesses reported a southeast to northwest movement. WSR-88D data also showed the mesocyclone associated with the tornado moving from south to north in a looping manner when the tornado was reported. The last tornado, the sixteenth of this episode, touched down briefly in an open field 5 miles northwest of Tonkawa at 2130 CST. Tonkawa Emergency Management reported no damage. Thus, this tornado was rated an F0.    In addition to these tornadoes, a large macroburst containing damaging straight-line winds occurred from 13 miles west of Medford (Grant County) to 4 miles west northwest of Pond Creek. Satellite dishes owned by Classic Cable Company, which were rated at 110 mph, were flattened by the winds. Straight-line wind damage was also reported in Alva where one man sustained minor injuries when he was blown into the bed of a pickup truck. Also in Alva at least 3 mobile homes suffered major damage; several carports were destroyed; awning and minor roof damage occurred to many homes; and trees and power lines were blown down. One indirect fatality occurred in Alva when a man slipped and suffered a heart attack while seeking shelter in a storm cellar. Other reports of straight-line wind damage include major roof damage to an old schoolhouse gymnasium in the city of Jefferson in Grant County. Two large cedar trees were also uprooted in Jefferson. A tree limb was blown through a picture window 14 miles north northeast of Camp Houston in Woods County. Windows were also blown out of a shed, and numerous trees were downed. Four to six inch tree limbs were blown down 9 miles west of Cherokee in Alfalfa County.  In Thomas in Custer County one utility pole was snapped and large limbs were blown down. Power lines were knocked down in Edmond in Oklahoma County. Severe winds also damaged the roof of the Fred Humphrey Pavillion in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County. The largest hail reported measured 3.5 inches in diameter and occurred in Medford in Grant County. Three reported events of at least tennis ball size hail occurred in Goltry (Alfalfa County) in less than 2 hours: tennis ball size hail at 2140 CST and 2230 CST, and baseball size hail at 2305 CST. Between 30 and 100 percent of the wheat crop was destroyed due to large hail from about 2 miles west of Jet to near Goltry. Another area south of Cherokee, near the junction of US 64 and SH 8 also sustained major wheat crop damage. In addition numerous vehicles had their windows broken. Tennis ball size hail also damaged the wheat crop and numerous vehicles in Okarche in Canadian County while in Watonga in Blaine County golf ball size hail damaged RV vehicles and street lights. Quarter size hail damaged several vehicles 6 miles north of Piedmont in Canadian County. Lightning struck a house in Piedmont causing a house to catch on fire. The last of the severe thunderstorms moved through northern Oklahoma during the early morning of May 25th, resulting in flooding near Cherokee and the National Wildlife Refuge in Alfalfa County, where 5.5 inches of rain fell. Several streets and the city park were also flooded in Blackwell in Kay County during the evening of May 24th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 55K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Three tornadoes were also sighted. Storms first developed in Kay County during the late morning where a semi-truck was blown over 1.5 miles southwest of Blackwell near the intersection of Highway 11 and Interstate 35. Severe thunderstorms then redeveloped over Major and Blaine Counties a few hours later. As these storms moved east into Garfield County, a tornado was spotted 3 miles south of Waukomis moving east. This tornado, rated an F1, knocked down or snapped 40 to 50 power poles, damaged several outbuildings, and destroyed numerous trees. One large diesel storage tank was picked up and desposited one-half mile away. A pickup truck containing 2 occupants was also picked up a short distance from the road and dropped on the side of the road near a creek. Both occupants were uninjured. A semi-trailer was also blown off the highway. As the tornado dissipated, severe thunderstorm winds blew down large tree limbs in Bison, and lightning from the same complex of thunderstorms struck a house in Enid, causing a short in the wiring, which then started a small house fire. Large tree limbs were also downed in Seiling in Dewey County, while a rain gutter from a house was ripped off by the winds 12 miles east of Hennessey in Kingfisher County breaking several flower pots. Large tree limbs were also downed in the same location.As the thunderstorms moved into Logan County, Oklahoma Mesonet measured wind gusts of 59 mph and 66 mph at 1620 CST and 1630 CST respectively 3 miles southeast of Marshall. A weak, F0 tornado was then spotted 9 miles north of Crescent, just west of State Highway 74. The tornado uprooted several trees while crossing the highway, then quickly dissipated. Another weak tornado, an F0, was spotted on the Blaine/Dewey County border 2 miles west of Canton, knocking down trees and power poles. The same thunderstorm was responsible for a lightning strike at the Old Christian Church in Eagle City in Blaine County causing a fire that destroyed the church. As these storms moved east, thunderstorm winds damaged a fence, silo, and several trees in Logan County 3 miles southwest of Langston. Several power poles were blown down 1 mile north of Loyal in Kingfisher County, while in the city of Loyal 13 power poles were snapped, and large tree limbs were blown down. Widespread wind damage occurred in the city of Kingfisher consisting of downed trees and power lines over a 12 square block area on the northwest side of the city. The garage of a house also shifted causing roof damage. Oklahoma Mesonet measured wind gusts of 63 mph and 80 mph at 1900 CST and 1905 CST respectively 4 miles southwest of Guthrie in Logan County. Straight-line winds then produced a large swath of damage to mobile homes, house roofs, trees, power poles and power lines in a 4 by 6 mile area across southern Logan County bounded by Western Ave to the west, Interstate 35 to the east, Forest Hills Road to the north, and Waterloo Road to the south. The worst damage occurred in a 1/2 by 1 1/2 mile area near Oak Cliff. Two-hundred fifty residents were damaged. Of these, 10 homes and business building were destroyed, while 41 structures suffered major damage. One hundred sixty-one single family homes, 43 mobile homes, 7 businesses, and 1 apartment complex suffered minor structural damage. Total damage estimates were near 3.5 million dollars. Five persons were injured, consisting mostly of broken fingers and cuts. No one was seriously injured. Lightning also struck an oil tank at Pine and Industrial in Guthrie, starting a fire that was quickly extinguised.Unusually strong straight-line winds also left a swath of damage roughly 8 miles long and 2 miles wide from just east of Jones in eastern Oklahoma County, east-southeast into extreme western Lincoln County 3 miles northeast of Harrah. A two year-old boy was killed, and ten persons were injured, 8 of which were transported to local hospitals. Damage was estimated at about 2 million dollars. Damage was intermittent from east of Jones to north of Horseshoe Lake and was limited mainly to fallen tree limbs. A more persistent area of wind damage about 1.5 miles wide was found from near Luther Road and Wilshire southeast to near the county line and Northeast 50th. Widespread tree damage occurred in this area along with structural damage to several homes. By far the most concentrated area of damage was along a half-mile wide swath from Harrah Road and 63rd extending east-southeast. Several mobile homes were completely destroyed in this area, one of which disintegrated with the frame left wrapped around a tree. All of the destroyed mobile homes were perpendicular to the wind or nearly so and thus were hit broadside by the full force of the wind. The level of damage in this swath is estimated at strong F1 suggesting that maximum winds probably were between 100 and 110 mph.Damage in Lincoln County consisted of downed power lines, uprooted trees, and damaged outbuildings in a half-mile wide by one-mile long swath just north of Highway 62. One barn also disintegrated as it was picked up by the wind and carried nearly one-quarter of a mile. In total, 75 homes were damaged; 11 suffered major damage, and six (All mobile homes) were destroyed. Three mobile homes were found to be totally disintegrated and one other that was rolled from its foundation. Several eyewitness reports indicated that at least some of these mobile homes were airborne while or just before they were destroyed. The fatality, and most of the injuries, were residents who were in the destroyed mobile homes when the winds struck. The last report of damage in Lincoln County occurred in Chandler, where lightning struck numerous transformers and power poles, knocking out power to all of Chandler for 5 hours.Severe thunderstorm winds also downed trees, wires, and numerous power poles all across the city of Edmond in Oklahoma County. Seven thousand residents were left without power for several hours. One tree fell on a car, and the canopy was blown off at Juffy Lube on 2nd Street, east of Bryant. Farther south and east, a tree was blown down near the Mazzio's Pizza on State Highway in Cushing in Payne County; highway signs and numerous trees were downed near Highway 44 in Cleveland County 4 miles west of Moore, and trees and power lines were blown down in Norman, also in Cleveland County. Lightning struck an oil tank battery in Slaughterville in Cleveland County, causing a fire that burned for about 1 hour before being extinguished. A mobile home was blown off its foundation and destroyed in Shawnee in Pottawatomie County. Five persons were inside the home including 3 children who were injured from minor cuts and bruises. The roof was also blown off of a boathouse at Shawnee Lake, also in Pottawatomie County. Numerous Numerous power lines were downed 8 miles east of Pauls Valley in Garvin County knocking out power to 500 residents, while a house sustained significant roof damage from strong winds. Rain poured into the house causing an estimated $20,000 in damage. Power lines and large tree limbs were downed in Wewoka in Seminole County and Holdenville in Hughes County. Lastly, Lightning struck a tree in Sulphur in Murray County, killing 3 cows and an angus bull standing under it.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The winds tore a large section of the roof off a restaurant and a boat storage facility, damaged 50 boats, 20 severely, damaged the roof of 5 docks and destroyed a barn.  The wind also turned 6 camper trailers onto their side.  Two people in one of the trailers were injured.  A total of 80 camper trailers plus several smaller vehicles received dents and broken windows from debris and golf ball size hail driven by the strong winds.  Numerous trees, large limbs, and several power lines were also brought to the ground.  A damage survey by National Weather Service meteorologists confirmed the occurrence of a brief weak tornado but it did not appear to be the source of much damage.

Once again, damage was highlighted by downed trees, large hail, and several cases of flash flooding.  Much of the notable tree damage occurred over and east of the piedmont; flash flooding was seen over and west of the piedmont.The episode was dominated by a single supercell which developed over the west central piedmont near the Blue Ridge and propagated east through Fauquier, Prince William, Fairfax, and Arlington Cos, as well as the independent city of Alexandria.  Earlier cells caused scattered severe weather generally northwest of these areas.The first event of consequence occurred in Woodstock (Shenandoah Co), where a localized storm dumped at least 2 inches of rain in 2 hours - on top of saturated soil - producing flash flooding in portions of town.  Poor drainage and low-lying areas were hard hit, in some instances worse than the flooding in 1996 (associated with tropical storm Fran).  A two-block area was evacuated.  Included in this area was a barbecue catering company, which had some equipment washed out of the store.  A small sport utility vehicle was washed up against a low-water bridge, with water cascading over the vehicle's roof.  Several side streets were flooded, not only in Woodstock but in nearby Toms Brook as well.As the storms tracked east, there were several reports of hail ranging from 0.75" to 1" in diameter. Additional flash flooding occurred in Warren Co, where a minor mud slide temporarily closed a portion of Browntown Road.  Low-lying flooding closed the intersection of River and Harrell Road.  Around this time, one thunderstorm cell became dominant as it crossed into Fauquier Co.  Soon after, the storm exhibited a bow-echo feature, and accounts of damaging winds increased accordingly.Large hail, ranging from 0.75" to 2" in diameter, fell across portions of Prince William and Fairfax Cos.  Wind gusts knocked trees and large limbs down in Centreville.  Heavier damage occurred as the bow-echo strengthened, in southern Fairfax Co and Alexandria.  In Springfield and Mt Vernon, trees fell on two cars; one motorist was injured (in Springfield) but the other(s) escaped unharmed.  Farther east, at least a dozen trees were felled in Alexandria; large limbs fell on power lines in the south portion of Arlington.  Several more large limbs and/or trees fell alongside or onto the Capital Beltway.  A bit farther south, numerous trees fell along federal highway 1 (west of Wide Water) in extreme northern Stafford Co.A final event occurred in eastern Nelson Co, where several trees fell, including one onto a porch and another onto the roof of the same residence, causing substantial structural damage to the home.In all, 31,000 Virginia Power customers lost power during the storms.  Frequent lightning was also a problem, though there were no house fires, and no injuries were reported.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This intense convection developed well ahead of a strong cold front.  The storms resulted in one fatality and three injuries.  An elderly man was instantly killed at Ellenville in Ulster County, when a large tree limb fell on him.  Two injuries occurred in Fulton County and one injury in Montgomery County.  The injuries were the result of fallen tree limbs and wires.  Across the region the damaging winds knocked out power to approximately 40,000 customers, broke several power poles and damaged dozens of homes due to fallen trees or large branches.  Damage was most widespread in Montgomery, Fulton, Saratoga, Warren and Washington Counties.  State Highway 9N south of Bolton Landing in Warren County and route 4 in the Whitehall area in northern Washington County, were closed through the evening hours due to tree debris.  At North Winfield in southern Herkimer County, a silo collapsed in the damaging winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The thunderstorm formed in northeast Guernsey County about 430 pm just ahead of another very intense thunderstorm moving through Muskingum County.  It then moved southeast at nearly 40 mph.The swath of damage produced by this intense downburst of wind was estimated to be nearly 8 miles long.  Its width fluctuated between 0.75 miles to over 2.5 miles.  The damage started just south of Cambridge and continued southeast to near the town of Buffalo.  There were 3 reported injuries which consisted of cuts and abrasions.  One person was treated and released from the hospital. The town of Byesville was hardest hit.  Hundreds of trees were snapped or toppled.  Power lines and telephone poles were also downed which resulted in widespread power outages.  There were some outbuildings destroyed, as well as damage to shingles, siding and roofs.  Part of a roof of a school was torn off.  Billboards, business signs and Interstate highway signs were also partially or totally destroyed.  It was also reported that about 30 automobiles in a grocery store parking lot had their windows completely shattered.  A plate glass window in a fast food restaurant was also shattered.  The area was declared a disaster area by the Governor of Ohio. On Interstate 77, there was a report of a tractor-trailed truck which was stopped in its tracks by the tremendous gust as it tried to move forward.  It actually spun its wheels as if it were on ice without moving and an automobile behind it collided with the truck.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 400K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The warm weather culminated on the 6th, when Detroit reached a high of 69 degrees - the warmest reading ever in Detroit in December.  However, a powerful cold front swung through the state late in the evening on the 6th.  A thin line of showers and thunderstorms accompanied the front, moving east at about 50 mph.  Many of the storms along the line produced wind damage.  The result was a December severe weather episode - a rather uncommon event for Michigan.  Most of the wind damage occurred immediately behind the line of convection, and the majority of the damage involved the downing of trees, large limbs, and power lines.The majority of the severe weather occurred near or south of Interstate 69.  The most notable exception to this was a swath of wind damage across southern Sanilac County, from Marlette to Lexington.  Barns and silos were destroyed near Marlette, and a home was deroofed.A more spotty damage path roughly followed I-69 from Davison to Port Huron.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph wind in Davison.  Limbs and power lines were downed further east, in Lapeer and Port Huron.  Damage was also spotty across Livingston, Oakland, and Macomb Counties.  In Oakland County, the National Weather Service office in White Lake measured a 63 mph gust.  In Farmington, a home was heavily damaged when it was struck by a large evergreen.  A tree fell onto a vehicle on Middlebelt Road in West Bloomfield Township, and the two occupants suffered minor injuries.  In Birmingham, the walls of a construction project were blown over, while in Troy, a billboard was shredded by severe winds.  The city of Utica in Macomb County was especially hard hit, with many trees and power lines downed.Damage was a little heavier across Washtenaw and Wayne Counties.  A barn was destroyed near Manchester.  A 64 mph gust was measured at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, while Detroit Metropolitan Airport had a 60 mph gust.  In between those two sites, heavy damage occurred in Ypsilanti and at nearby Willow Run Airport.  Three apartments suffered extensive roof damage near Ypsilanti, and a home was damaged by a falling tree.  At Willow Run Airport, many planes were tossed about, resulting in the destruction of 4 planes, and damage to another half-dozen or so.  In Livonia, a metal shed was thrown into a yard two homes down from where it started.  In addition, the walls of a drug store under construction were toppled.  Nativity scenes were thrown about in Plymouth and Romulus.  An historic elm tree lost large limbs in Lincoln Park, a nearby school suffered substantial roof damage, and a dry cleaners under construction was damaged.  In Trenton, a trampoline became airborne and flew into nearby tree limbs and power lines, downing them.Damage was isolated in the southernmost tier of counties.  A tree fell on a home in Devils Lake, and an uprooted tree came crashing down onto a garage in Monroe.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 60K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Incredibly powerful, hurricane-force straight-line winds, with peak gusts of 100 to 128 mph tore through 12 counties in this part of the state, while another 8 counties had peak gusts of 60 to 80 mph.  Residents noted that the strongest winds only lasted a minute or two, but gusty winds hung on for 15 to 30 minutes.  Meteorologically,  a solid squall line developed in southern Minnesota and gathered strength as it raced east with a translational speed of 50 to 60 mph across southcentral and southeast Wisconsin. The squall line was orientated southwest to northeast and had many microbursts and macrobursts embedded in it.  Whereas all 20 counties in southcentral and southeast Wisconsin reported scattered to widespread wind damage, there were 5 main corridor, or swaths of concentrated micro/macroburst damage: 1) central Sauk county through northern Dane county through northern Jefferson county and southern Dodge county through Waukesha county and into Milwaukee county, 2) eastcentral Columbia county across northern Dodge county through southeast Fond du Lac county and through southern Sheboygan county, 3) West Bend area of central Washington county east to the Port Washington area of Ozaukee county, 4) southeast Iowa county into northwest Green county, and 5) northwest to central part of Lafayette county. Newspaper headlines used a variety of words to describe this event: war zone, devastating, unbelievable, wicked wind, blown to bits, amazing, "Nature's Spring Cleaning," and "traveling back to the dark ages."Utility companies and Emergency Managers stated that this was the most damaging, widespread, straight-line thunderstorm wind event to affect southern Wisconsin in the past100 years!  Estimated, monetary damage amounts for all 20 counties were $55.852 million for residental or mobile homes, businesses, utilities buildings, agriculture buildings, signs, street lights, billboards, campers, and boats; and $1.485 million in crop and livestock losses.  As a sign of the wind power, many concrete silo's had their tops blown off, and many barns flattened.  Many homes and other structures had their roofs peeled off.  Thousands of large trees were either uprooted or broken/twisted by the winds.  Hundreds of power poles were snapped or pushed over by the winds, or falling trees/branches. At one time, about 60,000 customers were without electricity in southcentral Wisconsin, and about 170,000 in southeast Wisconsin.  Some residences or businesses were without power for as much as 5 or 6 days due to deluge of utility repairs and shortage of replacement power poles.  Hundreds or motor vehicles were either damaged or totaled by falling trees/branches, or collapsed garages.  The monetary damages to motor vehicles is not included in the totals given above.  In addition, numerous vehicle accidents resulted from inoperative stop/go street lights as roads quickly became log jams. 1.  Sauk County: peak winds estimated at 100 to 120 mph.

This particular derecho formed in South Dakota on the evening of Saturday, May 30th, and raced eastward at 70 mph across Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, before striking Michigan's Lower Peninsula around 4:30 am EDT Sunday morning, May 31st. The derecho event produced widespread 60 to 90 mph wind gusts, which caused extensive tree and structural damage and left over 861,000 homes and businesses without electricity across Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan). There were 4 storm-related fatalities reported in the state and 146 injuries (mostly minor). Statewide, approximately 250 homes were destroyed, 12,250 homes damaged, 34 businesses destroyed, and 829 businesses damaged. Damage estimates across the above listed counties totaled over $166 Million. 	NWS Storm Damage Field Studies suggested highest wind gusts in wet microbursts reached 120 to 130 mph in Spring Lake (Ottawa County) and Walker (Kent County), 100 mph in portions of Montcalm County (including Cody Lake and Stanton), 90 mph in Rockford (Kent County) and Zeeland (Ottawa County), and 80 mph in Big Rapids (Mecosta County), Ludington (Mason County), Sparta (Kent County), and northern Osceola County. On June 24th, President Clinton declared 13 Michigan counties federal disaster areas, including the following 10 from the NWSO Grand Rapids County Warning Area: Clinton, Gratiot, Ionia, Kent, Mason, Montcalm, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oceana, and Ottawa. It took up to 10 days to fully restore power to certain areas including the City of Walker and portions of Montcalm and Gratiot Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Michigan State Police EMD's Damage and Injury Assessment Report indicated $502,700 in public damage costs, 910 homes damaged, 2 homes destroyed, and 131 businesses damaged.

Incredibly powerful, hurricane-force straight-line winds, with peak gusts of 100 to 128 mph tore through 12 counties in this part of the state, while another 8 counties had peak gusts of 60 to 80 mph.  Residents noted that the strongest winds only lasted a minute or two, but gusty winds hung on for 15 to 30 minutes.  Meteorologically,  a solid squall line developed in southern Minnesota and gathered strength as it raced east with a translational speed of 50 to 60 mph across southcentral and southeast Wisconsin. The squall line was orientated southwest to northeast and had many microbursts and macrobursts embedded in it.  Whereas all 20 counties in southcentral and southeast Wisconsin reported scattered to widespread wind damage, there were 5 main corridor, or swaths of concentrated micro/macroburst damage: 1) central Sauk county through northern Dane county through northern Jefferson county and southern Dodge county through Waukesha county and into Milwaukee county, 2) eastcentral Columbia county across northern Dodge county through southeast Fond du Lac county and through southern Sheboygan county, 3) West Bend area of central Washington county east to the Port Washington area of Ozaukee county, 4) southeast Iowa county into northwest Green county, and 5) northwest to central part of Lafayette county. Newspaper headlines used a variety of words to describe this event: war zone, devastating, unbelievable, wicked wind, blown to bits, amazing, "Nature's Spring Cleaning," and "traveling back to the dark ages."Utility companies and Emergency Managers stated that this was the most damaging, widespread, straight-line thunderstorm wind event to affect southern Wisconsin in the past100 years!  Estimated, monetary damage amounts for all 20 counties were $55.852 million for residental or mobile homes, businesses, utilities buildings, agriculture buildings, signs, street lights, billboards, campers, and boats; and $1.485 million in crop and livestock losses.  As a sign of the wind power, many concrete silo's had their tops blown off, and many barns flattened.  Many homes and other structures had their roofs peeled off.  Thousands of large trees were either uprooted or broken/twisted by the winds.  Hundreds of power poles were snapped or pushed over by the winds, or falling trees/branches. At one time, about 60,000 customers were without electricity in southcentral Wisconsin, and about 170,000 in southeast Wisconsin.  Some residences or businesses were without power for as much as 5 or 6 days due to deluge of utility repairs and shortage of replacement power poles.  Hundreds or motor vehicles were either damaged or totaled by falling trees/branches, or collapsed garages.  The monetary damages to motor vehicles is not included in the totals given above.

A weak tornado (F1 on the Fujita Scale) moved through Londonderry and West Marlborough Townships.  A second tornado (F1 on the Fujita Scale also) moved through eastern Pocopson and Birmingham Townships.  Damage estimates were around one million dollars and included road clearance, clearing trees from houses and automobiles as well as damage to homes.  Throughout the county one mobile home was destroyed, five homes had major damage or were destroyed, 19 homes had minor to moderate damage and 24 homes had minor or less damage.  The hardest hit communities included Birmingham Township, Cochranville (part of West Fallowfield Township),  Highland Township, Kenneth (including Kenneth Square) Township,  Londonderry Township and New Garden Township.  Only two persons were injured in Cochranville.  Cochranville,  Highland Township,  Londonderry Township,  Lower Oxford Township,  West Fallowfield Township and West Marlborough Township all were declared either local disaster or county emergency areas.  Governor Tom Ridge also declared Chester County a disaster emergency.  About 115,000 homes and businesses lost power.  About 28,000 customers were still without power during the night of June 1st.  Power was not completely restored until the evening of the 4th.  This was the fourth worst and the greatest non-winter storm to affect the PECO Energy service area in its 50 year history.  About 336,000 customers lost power throughout their service area and PECO Energy distributed about 365,000 pounds of dry ice.  Sections of major roads such as U.S. Route 1, and Pennsylvania State Routes 41, 52, 82 and 926 were closed by downed trees and wires.  Even in open sections, traffic crawled due to non working traffic lights.  Roads were still closed in Birmingham, East Fallowfield, Highland, London Grove, Londonderry and New Garden Townships the night of June 1st.  Five southern Chester County School districts had to cancel classes on Monday, June 1st.  One could not reopen until Wednesday, June 3rd.   The line of severe thunderstorms entered the county in West Fallowfield and Lower Oxford Townships about 1240 a.m. EDT on June 1st and wasted no time causing damage.  In Lower Oxford Township poles along Pennsylvania State Route 10 were snapped and Pennsylvania State Route 896 was partially blocked by downed trees.  In West Fallowfield Township, the thunderstorms hit the King Road area of Cochranville the hardest.  About 30 homes were damaged.  A couple of mobile homes were either crushed or severely damaged by fallen trees.  One woman was temporarily trapped.  Several barns or silos were also destroyed.  On one plot over 100 trees were uprooted.  The Red Cross worked with thirteen displaced families in the area.   The first tornado of the night touched down in Londonderry Township at about 12:43 a.m. EDT on June 1st.  The touchdown occurred just north of the intersection of Fernwood and Jackson Roads.  The tornado moved west to east into West Marlborough Township.  It was there it reached its maximum intensity.  The tornado continued to travel almost due east and lifted in the extreme eastern part of the township near Pennsylvania State Route 842.  Hundreds of trees were knocked down, but structural damage since this tornado passed through relatively rural areas was minimal.  The tornado stayed on the ground for about 6 miles and its width was about 100 yards. Even though the tornado lifted,  wind damage continued farther east into East Marlborough Township.  Hundreds of trees were uprooted, at least one vehicle was crushed and a flag pole was bent to the ground.  In northern parts of London Grove Township, a couple of mobile homes were overturned and a tree crushed a garage.   At one point during the night, all major roads were closed in New Garden Township due to downed trees and wires.  As the line headed farther east, almost all of Kenneth Square lost power as large trees were uprooted.  Many homes and vehicles were hit by trees.  Included in the tree casualties, was a 140-year-old Kentucky Coffee Tree, which was one of the oldest in the eastern part of Pennsylvania.   As the line went farther east, it dropped the second tornado of the night.  At about 12:52 a.m. EDT a tornado touched down in the far eastern part of Pocopson Township along Pennsylvania State Route 52 just to the west of the Brandywine River and the intersections of Pennsylvania State Routes 52 and 100.  The tornado moved northwest to southeast into Birmingham Township and intensified into a F1 tornado and caused damage.  The tornado lifted just west of the Dilworthtown Inn in Dilworthtown near the Delaware County line.  Hundreds of trees were down with power lines down in over one hundred locations.  At least five homes had roof and window damage.  The Spring Meadows Development had some of the worst damage with a couple of homes and several vehicles struck by fallen trees.  The tornado was on the ground for about 3 miles and its width was about 100 yards.  It appears as though the winds in this tornado reached near the high end of the F1 scale and probably were close to 100 mph at its maximum intensity.The wind damage was not done in Chester County.  The line of severe thunderstorms sheared off part of the side of a house in West Chester.  In Easttown, eight roads were closed because of downed trees.  While most of the wind damage was in the southern half of the county, a thunderstorm in the far northern part of the county also turned severe in East and South Coventry Townships.  In Bucktown in South Coventry Township, one tree fell on a home and damaged some of its shingles and rain spouts.  In East Coventry Township, six roads were at least partially blocked by downed trees.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Incredibly powerful, hurricane-force straight-line winds, with peak gusts of 100 to 128 mph tore through 12 counties in this part of the state, while another 8 counties had peak gusts of 60 to 80 mph.  Residents noted that the strongest winds only lasted a minute or two, but gusty winds hung on for 15 to 30 minutes.  Meteorologically,  a solid squall line developed in southern Minnesota and gathered strength as it raced east with a translational speed of 50 to 60 mph across southcentral and southeast Wisconsin. The squall line was orientated southwest to northeast and had many microbursts and macrobursts embedded in it.  Whereas all 20 counties in southcentral and southeast Wisconsin reported scattered to widespread wind damage, there were 5 main corridor, or swaths of concentrated micro/macroburst damage: 1) central Sauk county through northern Dane county through northern Jefferson county and southern Dodge county through Waukesha county and into Milwaukee county, 2) eastcentral Columbia county across northern Dodge county through southeast Fond du Lac county and through southern Sheboygan county, 3) West Bend area of central Washington county east to the Port Washington area of Ozaukee county, 4) southeast Iowa county into northwest Green county, and 5) northwest to central part of Lafayette county. Newspaper headlines used a variety of words to describe this event: war zone, devastating, unbelievable, wicked wind, blown to bits, amazing, "Nature's Spring Cleaning," and "traveling back to the dark ages."Utility companies and Emergency Managers stated that this was the most damaging, widespread, straight-line thunderstorm wind event to affect southern Wisconsin in the past100 years!  Estimated, monetary damage amounts for all 20 counties were $55.852 million for residental or mobile homes, businesses, utilities buildings, agriculture buildings, signs, street lights, billboards, campers, and boats; and $1.485 million in crop and livestock losses.  As a sign of the wind power, many concrete silo's had their tops blown off, and many barns flattened.  Many homes and other structures had their roofs peeled off.  Thousands of large trees were either uprooted or broken/twisted by the winds.  Hundreds of power poles were snapped or pushed over by the winds, or falling trees/branches. At one time, about 60,000 customers were without electricity in southcentral Wisconsin, and about 170,000 in southeast Wisconsin.  Some residences or businesses were without power for as much as 5 or 6 days due to deluge of utility repairs and shortage of replacement power poles.  Hundreds or motor vehicles were either damaged or totaled by falling trees/branches, or collapsed garages.  The monetary damages to motor vehicles is not included in the totals given above.

Incredibly powerful, hurricane-force straight-line winds, with peak gusts of 100 to 128 mph tore through 12 counties in this part of the state, while another 8 counties had peak gusts of 60 to 80 mph.  Residents noted that the strongest winds only lasted a minute or two, but gusty winds hung on for 15 to 30 minutes.  Meteorologically,  a solid squall line developed in southern Minnesota and gathered strength as it raced east with a translational speed of 50 to 60 mph across southcentral and southeast Wisconsin. The squall line was orientated southwest to northeast and had many microbursts and macrobursts embedded in it.  Whereas all 20 counties in southcentral and southeast Wisconsin reported scattered to widespread wind damage, there were 5 main corridor, or swaths of concentrated micro/macroburst damage: 1) central Sauk county through northern Dane county through northern Jefferson county and southern Dodge county through Waukesha county and into Milwaukee county, 2) eastcentral Columbia county across northern Dodge county through southeast Fond du Lac county and through southern Sheboygan county, 3) West Bend area of central Washington county east to the Port Washington area of Ozaukee county, 4) southeast Iowa county into northwest Green county, and 5) northwest to central part of Lafayette county. Newspaper headlines used a variety of words to describe this event: war zone, devastating, unbelievable, wicked wind, blown to bits, amazing, "Nature's Spring Cleaning," and "traveling back to the dark ages."Utility companies and Emergency Managers stated that this was the most damaging, widespread, straight-line thunderstorm wind event to affect southern Wisconsin in the past100 years!  Estimated, monetary damage amounts for all 20 counties were $55.852 million for residental or mobile homes, businesses, utilities buildings, agriculture buildings, signs, street lights, billboards, campers, and boats; and $1.485 million in crop and livestock losses.

Winds over 85 mph hit near Sherwood, where two barns were destroyed and two houses sustained damage.  A garage at one of the residences was completely removed from its foundation and tipped on its side.  A few minutes earlier from a different thunderstorm, a tornado touched down near Stockbridge, destroying a garage and silo, damaging two barns and overturning farm vehicles.  A 2-by-4 was driven through the exterior wall of a house, narrowly missing one of the sleeping children.  Damage in Calumet county alone topped $800,000.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 350K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Numerous trees and power lines were knocked down and three persons driving in vehicles were injured by fallen trees.   PECO energy reported about 185,000 homes and businesses in their service area lost power, 40,000 of them within and especially in Eastern Montgomery County.  Power was restored to everyone midday on Thursday July 2nd.  In Whitpain Township a driver was injured when a large tree split about 20 feet above the ground and one of its limbs pierced a window.  In Abington, two persons were injured when a large tree limb trapped them within their Blazer.  Another driver in Horsham was uninjured, but trapped inside his vehicle.  The hardest hit municipalities included Abington, Bryn Athyn, Lower Merion, Lower Moreland, Plymouth Meeting, Pottstown, Skippack, Springfield and Upper Salford Townships.  For the second time within about a month, trees were down all over the place in Lower Moreland Township. Trees fell onto houses in Abington, Bryn Athyn,  Horsham, Perkiomenville and Upper Dublin Townships.  Numerous vehicles were also damaged by fallen trees. Four streets were closed in Upper Moreland Township.  Four streets were still blocked the next day in Lower Merion Township.  Traffic was also slowed on the Schuylkill Expressway because of downed limbs.   About a half dozen trees were also uprooted on the Meadowlands Country Club in Whitpain Township.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Some of the highest wind gusts included 74 mph at RFD at 1159 CST, 73 MPH at Carol Stream at 1236 CST, 80 mph at Joliet at 1253 pm CST, 61 mph at Burbank at 1300 CST and 67 mph at Midlothian at around 1310 CST. Four inch diameter tree limbs were blown down in southern Winnebago County. Tree damage was widespread across northern Ogle County, including trees and limbs on houses. State Roads 72 and 64 were down to one lane in places. The roof of Byron High School was damaged. There was also extensive damage to corn crops. Trees and power lines were down in Lee County. Trees and power lines were damaged in northern De Kalb County. A state trooper estimated winds in excess of 60 mph. A semi-tractor trailer driver was injured at Kirkland. A student suffered a broken leg and 10 other people had minor injuries at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb when the winds blew down tents and other debris at a display. In Kane County, trees were down at Elburn and signs were blown over at the Aurora toll plaza on I-88. A large tree fell on a house in Aurora. Large trees were blown down in northern Kendall County. In Minooka in northeast Grundy County winds gusted to 40 to 50 mph which caused a building under construction to collapse. A man was injured when he was trapped under the collapsed wall. In Du Page County , the roof was torn off a lumber store in Wheaton, a wall of a building under construction came down in Naperville and there was extensive damage to trees and houses in Wheaton and Lisle. A 39 year old worker was critically injured when he fell two stories from the roof of a building in Schaumburg. In Will County high winds damaged a roof at a shopping center in Crest Hill/Joliet, and tree limbs to 5 inches in diameter came down. Trees were also downed in Frankfort, New Lenox, Manhattan, Beecher, and Crete.  In Cook County, a day care center in Bridgeview had part of its roof torn off and windows broken. A CTA bus shelter blew over in the far southwest side of Chicago injuring a woman.  Part of the roof was peeled of Marist High School in the far southwest side of Chicago.

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 825K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.

Across the city of Pittsburgh, the North Hills area reported numerous trees, branches, and power lines down across an area one to two miles wide and nearly five miles in length.  Many homes were damaged by falling trees and branches.  The Larouche College area was especially hard hit with significant roof and window damage.

Hardest hit was the Lake Geneva (Walworth Co.) area where downburst winds leveled hundreds of large trees, several street signs,  and a large quantity of commercial signs.  A dozen vehicles were damaged or totaled and 2 homes sustained significant damage. A 100 mph wind was recorded at the Grand Geneva Airport and 2 people were injured (one in a moving vehicle). Local officials consider this to be the worst storm in 58 years. In Monroe (Green Co.), the powerful thunderstorm winds also damaged 6 vehicles and 2 homes.  Elsewhere, hail, high winds, lightning, and torrential rains played havoc. In West Bend (Washington Co.), lightning ignited a fire in an apartment complex and caused a quarter of a million dollars in damage. Urban flooding in Janesville (Rock Co.) resulted in standing water between a foot to a foot and a half deep across area roadways.  Wind damage was the most common culprit though with over 200 power lines downed and 17,000 customers without service in southeast Wisconsin and 10,000 residents left without power across south-central Wisconsin.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It downed several large trees and power lines.  Trees were blown into houses and caused structural damage.  This tornado then lifted and funnel clouds were observed before another touchdown (F0) occurred on the campus of Suffolk Community College in Selden.  Numerous trees were uprooted and fell on cars and wires on the campus.  More tree damage occurred along Middle Country Road and Mooney Pond Road in Selden.The first wave also included a line of thunderstorms that moved east across Orange County.  Thunderstorms produced high winds that downed trees in Goshen and Chester.  A funnel cloud was also observed between Goshen and Chester.The second wave included lines of severe thunderstorms that produced high winds, large hail, and frequent lightning.  This resulted in widespread damage across the region.In Orange County, high winds downed many trees and power lines.  Significant damage to trees and houses occurred in Monroe and Newburgh.  High winds also blew a trailer upside down on Bark Lane, off Big Island Road in Florida.  Four people were injured and required medical treatment at Arden Hill Hospital.  Lightning struck a house in Pine Bush, which ignited a fire and caused structural damage.In Rockland County, high winds downed power lines in New City and trees in Hillcrest and Stony Point.

A dozen vehicles were damaged or totaled and 2 homes sustained significant damage. A 100 mph wind was recorded at the Grand Geneva Airport and 2 people were injured (one in a moving vehicle). Local officials consider this to be the worst storm in 58 years. In Monroe (Green Co.), the powerful thunderstorm winds also damaged 6 vehicles and 2 homes.  Elsewhere, hail, high winds, lightning, and torrential rains played havoc. In West Bend (Washington Co.), lightning ignited a fire in an apartment complex and caused a quarter of a million dollars in damage. Urban flooding in Janesville (Rock Co.) resulted in standing water between a foot to a foot and a half deep across area roadways.  Wind damage was the most common culprit though with over 200 power lines downed and 17,000 customers without service in southeast Wisconsin and 10,000 residents left without power across south-central Wisconsin.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Torrential rains of 2 to 4 inches caused extensive road flooding as the line of storm merged over southern Quay County from San Jon and Wheatland west to Ragland. Storms bowed northward over the Logan and Ute Lake area of northern Quay County. A large microburst overturned several recreational vehicles and destroyed a number of boat sheds west of Logan.

These storms quickly became severe and merged over Walworth County.  Hurricane-force winds were generated over the north side of Elkhorn (Walworth Co.); and the resultant wind damage strongly suggests that winds gusts peaked in the 100 to 110 mph range. Officials in Elkhorn declared a state of emergency and asked for extra help with the cleanup, thanks to hundreds of downed trees and many power lines. Several Elkhorn downtown office buildings suffered some minor damage, while 6 buildings on the north side along Highway 67 had considerable damage (3-minor, 1 major, and 1 destroyed).  Thirteen people were injured and 14 vehicles sustained damage. This wicked dowburst then traveld through rural farmland east to the Walworth county line, destroying 3 farm buildings in the process.    Altogether, about 27.000 customers in Walworth County lost electrical power.  Further east, this wet macroburst became wider and left a path of damage or destruction about 6 to 8 miles wide across northern Kenosha County and southern Racine County.  In the Burlington area (Racine Co.), 300 trees were downed and many powerline or poles, leaving 15,000 customers were left without power. A plane tied down at the Burlington airport was tossed over, and rowboats on a local lake were damaged.  Elsewhere in southern Racine County,  traffic lights were damaged, the Great Lakes Dragway was closed, and the YMCA toboggan slide was destroyed. In Kenosha county 7 semi-trailer tractors were blown over on Interstate-94 west of Somers (Kenosha Co.)!  The downburst swath in northern Kenosha County also damaged several corn fields, downed hundreds of trees, leveled a barn near Somers, and damaged several homes. One account was that the town of Somers looked like a bomb exploded ater the storms passed through.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 250K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system dragged a warm front northeastward across central New York.  A southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for severe weather that afternoon and evening as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From early in the afternoon until the evening hours, central New York was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, six separate tornadoes touched down on this day in central New York.  The most devastating twister cut a discontinuous sixty plus mile track from southeastern Tioga county across southern Broome county and into Delaware county where it finally lifted back into the cloud base.  This tornado alone damaged or destroyed more than 30 homes and injured nearly 20 people.  Very fortunately, no fatalities occurred.  Another violent tornado ripped through southern sections of Otsego county between Laurens and Milford.  Thousands of trees were snapped off or uprooted with large sections of forest completely taken out.  Several residences were leveled and many roads were impassable for days due to the fallen debris.  The damage toll from this day's tornadoes ran into the millions.     Several strong bow echo complexes also affected central New York.  From southern Chenango county through the lower half of Otsego county, one such storm took out hundreds of trees and inflicted considerable structural damage in and around Oneonta.  One man was killed in Oneonta when hit by a falling tree limb.  Throughout Onondaga county, wind gusts estimated at 90 to 100 mph caused widespread damage early in the evening between 6:00 and 6:30 pm EDT.  Two large transmission towers near Nedrow were toppled from the winds and many buildings had blown out windows and/or roof damage.     Hail as large as 3 to 4 inches in diameter accompanied some of the tornadic supercells across New York's southern tier; smashing windows, severely denting cars, and causing crop losses.  New York State Electric and Gas Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power during the height of the storms late that afternoon and evening.  Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Severe thunderstorms moved across the county during the afternoon.  Trees and wires were blown down in Cooperstown and Laurens between 4:30 and 4:35 pm EDT.  Numerous trees and wires were also downed by the wind in Schenevus at 4:45 pm and Oneonta at 4:50 pm EDT.  Transmission towers and large signs were also toppled in Oneonta.  Numerous roads were blocked due to the downed trees and many of them were closed for several hours.     In Oneonta, a 32 year old man was struck and killed by a large tree limb.  Several additonal injuries were sustained from flying debris.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This intense convection developed well ahead of a strong cold front.  The storms resulted in one fatality and three injuries.  An elderly man was instantly killed at Ellenville in Ulster County, when a large tree limb fell on him.  Two injuries occurred in Fulton County and one injury in Montgomery County.  The injuries were the result of fallen tree limbs and wires.  Across the region the damaging winds knocked out power to approximately 40,000 customers, broke several power poles and damaged dozens of homes due to fallen trees or large branches.  Damage was most widespread in Montgomery, Fulton, Saratoga, Warren and Washington Counties.  State Highway 9N south of Bolton Landing in Warren County and route 4 in the Whitehall area in northern Washington County, were closed through the evening hours due to tree debris.  At North Winfield in southern Herkimer County, a silo collapsed in the damaging winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 30K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Widespread structural damage resulted and tens of thousands of trees were toppled in northern portions of the county.  Direct human impact was also felt.  Two fatalities and seven injuries occurred at the New York State Fairgrounds in Geddes.       The bow echo complex first entered northwestern sections of the county just after 100 am EDT.  It initially tore through the Baldwinsville area, leaving many streets littered with downed trees and utility poles.  The storms progressed rapidly towards the east-southeast and affected an area from Clay across Onondaga Lake to Camillus and Geddes from 115 to 120 am EDT.  Severe damage was inflicted upon the State Fairgrounds in Geddes.  Most of the temporary holding structures or tents on the premises were either completely destroyed or sustained heavy damage.  Unfortunately, two individuals who were camping out before the last day of the New York State Fair died that night.  A 26 year old man was killed when he was struck by flying debris from a nearby building.  A 38 year old man, who was a vendor at the Fair, was killed when a large tree fell upon the tent where he was sleeping.  Seven other individuals had minor injuries, mostly cuts and scrapes from flying glass.  Three large flag poles at the entrance to the Fairgrounds were bent to almost a 45 degree angle from the force of the wind.  Many permanent buildings had roofs torn off, windows blown out, or siding severely damaged from felled trees.       In Marcellus and Camillus Townships, an estimated thousands of trees were blown down just in this area alone.  The Onondaga Hill section appeared to take on particularly severe damage with most roadways rendered completely impassable from downed trees and live wires.  Several homes also had various degrees of siding and roof damage in this vicinity, mainly from falling trees.     The storms then took aim on the Syracuse metropolitan area.  From approximately 125 to 135 am EDT, the city of Syracuse felt the brunt of the derecho.  An estimated many thousands of trees were toppled or damaged throughout the city.  One of the hardest hit sections was the Thornden Park area near Syracuse University.  In addition to tree damage, there was substantial structural damage (primarily roofs) to nearby homes and buildings.  Another fatality occurred in this vicinity when a large tree crashed through the roof of a home and struck an elderly woman who was sleeping.  She later died from extensive head injuries.  A textile factory had its roof almost completely torn away and many housing units for students at Syracuse University had blown out windows or damaged sections of the roof.  St. Lucy's Church, a sturdy brick structure, was nearly destroyed when its western steeple collapsed.  Many windows were also blown in at the University Hospital.  On the north side of town, an official wind gust to 75 mph was recorded at Hancock International Airport.       The storms maintained their intensity as they moved rapidly through the eastern suburbs.  Large hail to one inch in diameter was observed by a skywarn spotter in Manlius.  Another spotter in DeWitt measured a wind gust of 75 mph.  Much in the way of downed trees and structural damage was again reported.  A strip mall and fire station both in the town of Manlius had their roofs entirely torn off.  Two large antennas just south of Interstate 481 in DeWitt collapsed and interrupted local radio broadcasts.     In all, the financial toll from damage fell just short of 100 million dollars.  The final day of the New York State Fair was cancelled and the National Guard was called on to help with the cleanup efforts.  Onondaga county ultimately qualified for federal disaster funds after officials toured the area and reviewed post-storm damage surveys.  These surveys revealed a damage swath 10 to 12 miles long and nearly 30 miles wide.  Estimated peak wind gusts were near 115 mph.  Hundreds of thousands of people were without power for much of Labor Day.  Some customers did not have their power restored for the better part of a week.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 90M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Several storms became severe and produced widespread hail and wind damage. Hail and wind lasted 15-20 minutes at some locations. Numerous trees and power lines were downed, some on homes, and numerous power outages occurred. In Marion, downed trees severely damaged a mobile home. In the town of Catawba, a shed was blown apart and siding taken off a garage. A 5 year old girl was injured in her mobile home when a tree struck it. The southern half of Iredell county and much of Rowan county seemed to be hardest hit with large swaths of damage from winds, at times as high as 70 to 90 mph. Power poles were downed along Interstate 77. Boats and docks were damaged along Lake Norman. A roof was blown off a mobile home and a deck was destroyed in Troutman. Trees were downed on homes and outbuildings near China Grove and in Salisbury, with a damage path of trees and power lines down all the way to High Rock Lake. A car was crushed by a tree and a roof was blown off a supply store north of China Grove. Funnel cloud sightings were common with the passage of the storms in these areas.In the town of Gilkey, in Rutherford county, a storage building was blown into the woods.

The damage was most extensive in Berkeley and Dover Townships as straight line wind gusts exceeded hurricane force gusts in three swaths across these townships. One fire fighter was injured during clean-up operations.   About 15 homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Four persons suffered smoke inhalation after downed wires ignited a fire in Building C of the Silver Ridge Apartments in Dover Township.  Twenty-four apartments were evacuated and two units were badly damaged leaving the families homeless.  A shelter was opened at the Toms River High School.In Berkeley Township, the hardest hit area was within the Holiday City area.  One home had its roof lifted and a wall of its garage torn away.  Attic fans were knocked off several homes.  Emergency personnel responded to 42 calls for assistance. In Dover Township, one of the hardest hit areas was along New Jersey State Route 37 in Toms River.  Three homes on Michelle Drive were badly damaged by downed trees.  One home had a downed tree in its swimming pool.  Several business along State Route 37 had either roof damage and/or windows smashed.  Wind damage also occurred along Lakehurst Road east to the Community Medical Center  and the Toms River Country Club.  The squall line also uprooted trees in Manchester Township, Pine Beach, Ocean Gate and Beachwood Boroughs.  Lightning apparently burned a home to the ground within Beachwood Borough.  Very strong winds extended to the barrier islands.  A wind gust to 63 mph was measured in Seaside Park.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This particular derecho formed in South Dakota on the evening of Saturday, May 30th, and raced eastward at 70 mph across Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, before striking Michigan's Lower Peninsula around 4:30 am EDT Sunday morning, May 31st. The derecho event produced widespread 60 to 90 mph wind gusts, which caused extensive tree and structural damage and left over 861,000 homes and businesses without electricity across Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan). There were 4 storm-related fatalities reported in the state and 146 injuries (mostly minor). Statewide, approximately 250 homes were destroyed, 12,250 homes damaged, 34 businesses destroyed, and 829 businesses damaged. Damage estimates across the above listed counties totaled over $166 Million. 	NWS Storm Damage Field Studies suggested highest wind gusts in wet microbursts reached 120 to 130 mph in Spring Lake (Ottawa County) and Walker (Kent County), 100 mph in portions of Montcalm County (including Cody Lake and Stanton), 90 mph in Rockford (Kent County) and Zeeland (Ottawa County), and 80 mph in Big Rapids (Mecosta County), Ludington (Mason County), Sparta (Kent County), and northern Osceola County. On June 24th, President Clinton declared 13 Michigan counties federal disaster areas, including the following 10 from the NWSO Grand Rapids County Warning Area: Clinton, Gratiot, Ionia, Kent, Mason, Montcalm, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oceana, and Ottawa. It took up to 10 days to fully restore power to certain areas including the City of Walker and portions of Montcalm and Gratiot Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Michigan State Police EMD's Damage and Injury Assessment Report indicated $453,000 in public damage costs, 23 injuries, 6 individuals being sheltered, 400 homes damaged, 30 homes destroyed, 40 businesses damaged, and 50 vacation residences either damaged or destroyed. Private property damage was estimated around $13.5 Million. Most severe damage was reported in Pierson and Maple Valley Townships in the western panhandle of the county, with several cottages destroyed and damaged near and around Cody Lake and other area lakes. Significant damage was also reported in and around the city of Stanton. A team from the Michigan National Guard was deployed to the city of Stanton to assist in debris removal and cleanup operations. Montcalm County declared a local state of emergency and was granted a Governor's disaster declaration to activate state assistance for the county. On June 24th, President Clinton granted a Major Disaster Declaration for Montcalm County, making federal disaster assistance available.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 14M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's "gust front" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently "microbursts" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.  Overall, approximately twelve people sustained injuries and damage was estimated around $16 million.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system dragged a warm front northeastward across central New York.  A southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for severe weather that afternoon and evening as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From early in the afternoon until the evening hours, central New York was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, six separate tornadoes touched down on this day in central New York.  The most devastating twister cut a discontinuous sixty plus mile track from southeastern Tioga county across southern Broome county and into Delaware county where it finally lifted back into the cloud base.  This tornado alone damaged or destroyed more than 30 homes and injured nearly 20 people.  Very fortunately, no fatalities occurred.  Another violent tornado ripped through southern sections of Otsego county between Laurens and Milford.  Thousands of trees were snapped off or uprooted with large sections of forest completely taken out.  Several residences were leveled and many roads were impassable for days due to the fallen debris.  The damage toll from this day's tornadoes ran into the millions.     Several strong bow echo complexes also affected central New York.  From southern Chenango county through the lower half of Otsego county, one such storm took out hundreds of trees and inflicted considerable structural damage in and around Oneonta.  One man was killed in Oneonta when hit by a falling tree limb.  Throughout Onondaga county, wind gusts estimated at 90 to 100 mph caused widespread damage early in the evening between 6:00 and 6:30 pm EDT.  Two large transmission towers near Nedrow were toppled from the winds and many buildings had blown out windows and/or roof damage.     Hail as large as 3 to 4 inches in diameter accompanied some of the tornadic supercells across New York's southern tier; smashing windows, severely denting cars, and causing crop losses.  New York State Electric and Gas Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power during the height of the storms late that afternoon and evening.  Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Severe thunderstorms produced widespread damage across the county.  Trees and wires were blown down in Cooperstown and northern Burlington Flats between 3:30 and 3:40 pm EDT.  Several roads were blocked due to the downed trees and wires.  People were trapped in their vehicles by falling trees and some sustained injury from flying debris, broken glass, or falling wires.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 125K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These storms quickly became severe and merged over Walworth County.  Hurricane-force winds were generated over the north side of Elkhorn (Walworth Co.); and the resultant wind damage strongly suggests that winds gusts peaked in the 100 to 110 mph range. Officials in Elkhorn declared a state of emergency and asked for extra help with the cleanup, thanks to hundreds of downed trees and many power lines. Several Elkhorn downtown office buildings suffered some minor damage, while 6 buildings on the north side along Highway 67 had considerable damage (3-minor, 1 major, and 1 destroyed).  Thirteen people were injured and 14 vehicles sustained damage. This wicked dowburst then traveld through rural farmland east to the Walworth county line, destroying 3 farm buildings in the process.    Altogether, about 27.000 customers in Walworth County lost electrical power.  Further east, this wet macroburst became wider and left a path of damage or destruction about 6 to 8 miles wide across northern Kenosha County and southern Racine County.  In the Burlington area (Racine Co.), 300 trees were downed and many powerline or poles, leaving 15,000 customers were left without power. A plane tied down at the Burlington airport was tossed over, and rowboats on a local lake were damaged.  Elsewhere in southern Racine County,  traffic lights were damaged, the Great Lakes Dragway was closed, and the YMCA toboggan slide was destroyed. In Kenosha county 7 semi-trailer tractors were blown over on Interstate-94 west of Somers (Kenosha Co.)!  The downburst swath in northern Kenosha County also damaged several corn fields, downed hundreds of trees, leveled a barn near Somers, and damaged several homes. One account was that the town of Somers looked like a bomb exploded ater the storms passed through.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.9M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This particular derecho formed in South Dakota on the evening of Saturday, May 30th, and raced eastward at 70 mph across Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, before striking Michigan's Lower Peninsula around 4:30 am EDT Sunday morning, May 31st. The derecho event produced widespread 60 to 90 mph wind gusts, which caused extensive tree and structural damage and left over 861,000 homes and businesses without electricity across Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan). There were 4 storm-related fatalities reported in the state and 146 injuries (mostly minor). Statewide, approximately 250 homes were destroyed, 12,250 homes damaged, 34 businesses destroyed, and 829 businesses damaged. Damage estimates across the above listed counties totaled over $166 Million. 	NWS Storm Damage Field Studies suggested highest wind gusts in wet microbursts reached 120 to 130 mph in Spring Lake (Ottawa County) and Walker (Kent County), 100 mph in portions of Montcalm County (including Cody Lake and Stanton), 90 mph in Rockford (Kent County) and Zeeland (Ottawa County), and 80 mph in Big Rapids (Mecosta County), Ludington (Mason County), Sparta (Kent County), and northern Osceola County. On June 24th, President Clinton declared 13 Michigan counties federal disaster areas, including the following 10 from the NWSO Grand Rapids County Warning Area: Clinton, Gratiot, Ionia, Kent, Mason, Montcalm, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oceana, and Ottawa. It took up to 10 days to fully restore power to certain areas including the City of Walker and portions of Montcalm and Gratiot Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Michigan State Police EMD Damage and Injury Assessment Report indicated $2,458,958 in public damage costs, 42 homes destroyed, 1805 homes damaged, 5 businesses destroyed, and 73 businesses damaged. Two injuries were reported. Total public and private costs have been estimated at $24,205,908 according to FEMA and local media reports. Numerous local roads were closed during the day of May 31st for tree and debris removal. Approximately 50% of the city of Whitehall was left without water service and 50,000 customers were left without power in Muskegon County. The Muskegon Chronicle reported 5 large transmission towers were toppled northeast of the city of Muskegon. These towers carried high voltage electricity and were designed to withstand sustained 90 mph winds and gusts to 110 mph. The Muskegon Chronicle also reported severe crop damage to fruit trees (including apple, cherry, and peach) in the southeast part of Muskegon County. Estimated crop damage was $5.0 Million. Severe tree damage was reported in Muskegon State Park, Hoffmaster State Park, and Duck Lake State Park, all bordering Lake Michigan. Muskegon County declared a local state of emergency and was granted a Governor's disaster declaration to activate state assistance for the county. On June 24th, President Clinton granted a Major Disaster Declaration for Muskegon County, making federal disaster assistance available.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 24.21M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms fired up as warm air over ran the cooler air at the surface.  Storms formed over Nebraska and moved into western Iowa during the mid evening hours, then continued to advance east across the state.  For the most part the storms produced high winds with wind gusts to 70 MPH or more at times.  Winds gusted to 77 MPH west of Greenfield in Adair County.  There were numerous reports of trees and power lines downed.  One injury occurred in Union County as campers were overturned at Green Valley State Park by the high winds. Another injury occurred in Cass County when 65 to 80 MPH winds blew through.  Three semi-tractortrailers and one car were overturned by high winds in Interstate 80.   There were also many reports of farm sheds and buildings being damaged or destroyed by the winds.  Some building damage was reported in Creston.  A barn and farm shed was destroyed by high winds in Wayne County near Seymour.  Early in the storms development, a small tornado touched down in Cass County north of Anita.  The tornado destroyed several sheds and grain bins there.  In addition to the wind, there were numerous reports of marble size hail.  Hail was not a major event with these storms however.  The only large hail reports came early on in the event with golf ball size hail at Brayton in Audubon County, and one inch diameter hail reported in Cass County northwest of Atlantic.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Door county was particularly hard hit, as thunderstorms hit a park and campground west and south of Sturgeon Bay.  Three people suffered minor injuries at a camping resort south of Sturgeon Bay as winds at least 75 mph knocked over camping trailers and trees.  Another person was injured at Potawatomi State Park as a tree fell on his tent.  Three barns were destroyed, over 20 houses sustained damage, and the grandstand at Door County Fair Park was damaged.  A little later in the morning, lightning struck a house in the town of Gardner.  Total damage in Door county alone topped $150,000.The town of Rudolph (Wood co.) was hard hit, too, as winds reached over 70 mph, damaging buildings and uprooting or splitting trees.  A roof was torn off of a trailer home, a barn was flattened, a silo was damaged and many trees were knocked down.  The same storm produced damage at a camp in Rosholt (Portage co.), toppling over 500 trees on the 440-acre campus.  Several of the trees damaged roofs of buildings.  None of the 150 campers and 60 counselors were injured.  A storm that hit Wien (Marathon co.) blew a 115 foot wooden steeple off a church.Lightning struck a storage building in Cassel township (Marathon co.), causing damage to the building's contents.   In Oconto county, the steeple of a church in Klondike was struck by lightning and set on fire.  Lightning started two fires in Brown county.  One occurred at a tubing plant in De Pere; another lightning strike hit a residence near Holland, causing damage to a wall in the house.  In Outagamie county, lightning struck a 100-year old school, damaging the cupola and roof.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

An extremely humid airmass was also in place, with dew points in the upper 70s.  The above produced an extraordinarily unstable atmosphere, with CAPE values approaching 7000 J/kg.  A weak trough of low pressure moved east into western lower Michigan during the afternoon.  It was on this trough that thunderstorms first developed.  Thanks to the amount of instability present, these storms rapidly became severe.  Winds aloft were rather strong for mid-summer, with 40 knot winds less than a mile above ground level (at 850 mb).  Thus, the storms were prodigious producers of damaging wind gusts.Tragedy struck during the early evening in the downriver suburbs of Detroit.  A family of four attempted to leave a video store in Woodhaven during the height of the storm.  As the group left the building, a severe wind gust struck an awning located above the exit.  The awning was ripped off the building, and the brickwork the awning was attached to came with it.  The falling bricks proved deadly, as a young boy was killed instantly when his head was crushed.  His father suffered serious injuries to internal organs and his pelvic region, and succumbed to those injuries two and a half weeks later.  The other two children in the group were treated at the scene for minor injuries.Three other individuals were injured during the severe thunderstorm episode.  Ironically, the first injury of the event was also due to an awning collapse - this one in northwest Lenawee County.  Severe winds struck a campground near Michigan Speedway, where a major auto race would take place during the upcoming weekend.  The awning of a camper was blown down, injuring a bystander.  In Waterford (Oakland County), a young woman was struck by lightning at a park.  She required an overnight hospitalization.  In Macomb County, a man in St Clair Shores was knocked unconscious when a falling tree struck the car he was in.  His injuries also necessitated a brief hospital stay.The damage was almost exclusively confined to the southern three tiers of counties in southeast Michigan.  The one exception was in extreme western Shiawassee County, just east of Elsie, where a thunderstorm outflow downed large limbs and power lines.  Most of the damage was located in the heavily populated Detroit area.  Downed trees and power lines were common, and there were a few reports of large hail.The first county in southeast Michigan to be affected by severe weather was Lenawee.  Trees were downed in Ridgeway, Britton, Addison, and Deerfield.  Britton also received the largest hail during the entire severe weather episode.  In Tecumseh, two vehicles were damaged by fallen trees.  Roof damage at Tecumseh City Hall led to computer systems inside being destroyed by exposure to the elements.  Adrian was hit hard as well.  Numerous homes were damaged by fallen trees, and a radio tower at the sheriff department was knocked out of service.  Trees were downed just northeast of town.  Many trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in Hudson, with numerous cars hit by debris, and the roof of a business destroyed.  Amateur radio operators north of Addison and northeast of Adrian both estimated 65 mph winds.Severe thunderstorms struck Washtenaw County just minutes after first impacting Lenawee.  The communities of Chelsea, Dexter, and Manchester all saw some tree damage, but wind damage was more extensive between Chelsea and Manchester.  Thunderstorm winds laid over a corn field in Lodi Township, northwest of Saline.  Saline itself saw substantial damage: many trees were downed, heavily damaging a home and a vehicle; store windows were blown out in town; and, a screened-in porch was removed from its house.The thunderstorms continued to intensify as they moved east into the densely populated Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area.  Ann Arbor Municipal Airport measured a 75 mph wind gust, which blew two hangars off their foundations, damaged the doors of three hangars, and damaged several planes.  At least 75 trees were downed in Ann Arbor, most on the south side of town.  Ypsilanti was hit even harder.  Falling trees damaged numerous homes and vehicles, and several traffic signals came crashing down.  Gas pumps just south of the city were blown over.  Cleanup efforts in Ypsilanti took five weeks to complete.  South of Ypsilanti, several trees were downed in Milan, one of which demolished a car.  Many trees were uprooted in Augusta Township, just east of Milan.In Oakland County, thunderstorm winds downed a traffic signal in Highland.  Trees, limbs, and power lines were downed in a number of suburban communities, including Farmington, Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak, Troy, Clawson, Madison Heights, and Hazel Park.  Power lines fell on Interstate 75 near Rochester Road, closing that busy highway for more than an hour.  In Pontiac, a replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall was toppled; it was constructed to withstand 80 mph gusts.  A spotter in Rochester Hills estimated 60 mph winds with one thunderstorm.The south half of neighboring Macomb County was hit hard by severe thunderstorms.  Spotters in the south part of Sterling Heights reported dime sized hail and 76 mph winds.  In Warren, spotters reported gusts up to 75 mph.  The stretch of county between 10 and 12 Mile Roads, from Warren east to St Clair Shores, took the brunt of the storms.  Damage was extensive in Warren, Roseville, and St Clair Shores, with hundreds of downed trees and power lines.  Newspaper stands and store signs were knocked over in Warren.  In Roseville and Fraser, windows and roofs were removed from stores.  Further north, an office building in Mt Clemens was declared a total loss after it was deroofed by severe winds.  In nearby Harrison Township, power lines were downed.Damage was not quite as extensive in Monroe County.  Trees and power lines were downed in several locations in the county.  The electrical connections of several homes in Temperance were damaged.  Many trees were downed in the city of Monroe, where a home was damaged by a falling tree, while another had its porch destroyed.  A home was also heavily damaged by a falling tree in Stony Point.  Barns were deroofed in both Carleton and Exeter Township, while a garage was moved off its foundation in Carleton.However, the most intense damage of the episode occurred in the most populated county in the state: Wayne County.  The worst destruction was in Dearborn and Dearborn Heights.  Between the two cities, over 500 trees were downed, almost a thousand homes suffered some sort of damage, and thirty vehicles were destroyed.  In Dearborn, large chunks of the city were essentially defoliated, with over ten thousand trees damaged.  The worst damage was around the Michigan Avenue/Cherry Hill Road intersection.  Dearborn Heights reported over twelve hundred wires downed, and fifteen water mains were broken by uprooted trees.   Cleanup in the Dearborns was expected to continue into October.Damage was widespread, but not quite as intense, in the communities surrounding the Dearborns.  Some stores along Telegraph Road were damaged on the far northwest side of Detroit.  Dozens of limbs and power lines were downed in Redford.  The southeast part of Livonia saw trees uprooted, power lines down, and cars and homes damaged.  In Westland, forty trees were toppled, and the roof of an automobile showroom was blown away.  Many trees were downed in Garden City, especially on the east side.  Some roofs were damaged, windows were broken, and the deck of a home was destroyed.  There were many downed lines in Canton Township, with downed trees and lines in the city of Wayne.  In Inkster, one home was considered a total loss after a tree fell on it, and five other homes were damaged.Another swath of damaging winds began further south, around Detroit Metropolitan Airport.  Wind gusts of 58 mph caused the control tower to be evacuated, resulting in dozens of flights being cancelled or rerouted.  Two out of the three electrical feeds to the airport were disabled, resulting in continued problems into the next day.  Substantial damage also took place in the nearby cities of Romulus and Taylor.  This damage swath continued east to the Detroit River, with damage reported in the cities of Southgate, Lincoln Park, Ecorse, and River Rouge.  Two homes suffered major damage in Allen Park, while in Wyandotte, thirty homes and six businesses were damaged.An additional damage swath occurred across the far downriver suburbs.  This included Woodhaven, where the two fatalities occurred.  Storm damage also occurred in Flat Rock, Gibraltar, and Trenton.  On Grosse Ile, one hundred homes suffered some sort of damage, along with two businesses.  An automated observing system on Grosse Ile recorded a 62 mph gust.Yet another area of storm damage was in and near downtown Detroit.  At Wayne State University, windows were blown out at State Hall, and the press box of the football stadium collapsed into the stands below.  Many power lines were downed near Michigan and Livernois Avenues.  Downtown, a lawn chair was tossed up onto the track of the People Mover, a monorail system.  The next train by ran the chair over, causing damage to both train and track.  Also downtown, empty boxcars were rolled by the wind along a railroad track and into a building, causing significant structural damage.Finally, the far northeast part of Wayne County was on the fringe of the damage swath that hit southern Macomb County.  Harper Woods and all five of the Grosse Pointes saw tree limbs and power lines come down.  At Pier Park in Grosse Pointe Farms, several trees that had survived the 90+ mph winds of July 2, 1997, came crashing down.Overall, more than a thousand trees and five thousand power lines were downed in southeast Michigan.  Over 600,000 businesses and residences lost power at some point.  For Detroit Edison, this was the fourth worst weather system of all time regarding power outages.  The power was out for over a week in spots.  The storms also produced over 4300 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes.  Wayne County and parts of Macomb County received both state and federal disaster declarations.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.4M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Much wind damage resulted.  Most of the damage was in the form of downed trees and power lines, but there was a concentrated area of structural damage from Port Byron southwestward to Montezuma.     The line of severe thunderstorms first entered the county around 100 am EDT and affected an area from Montezuma to Throop to Port Byron between 100 and 110 am.  It was in this region that the greatest damage occurred in the county.  In the town of Port Byron, a 150 year old Presbyterian Church was nearly leveled by the ferocity of the wind.  Portions of its steeple and bell tower were blown several hundred yards and actually caused some damage to adjacent structures.  In Montezuma and Throop, many trees and utility poles were uprooted, with several landing on nearby cars and homes.  Dozens of homes in this area sustained siding and/or roof damage.         In the city of Auburn, the storm came through around 115 am EDT and felled numerous trees and power lines.  On the north side of town, damage to homes was more pronounced with roofs torn off of several buidings, including a department store.  A few minor injuries were caused by flying debris in this section of town.  The storms exited the county shortly before 125 am EDT with more tree damage in the town of Owasco.  Ten vacation homes in the Highland Beach area on the eastern side of Owasco Lake took on minor damage in the form of blown out windows, ripped off shingles, and damaged aluminum siding.             Damage estimates were close to 20 million dollars for the county.  Portions of Port Byron and Auburn in the hardest hit areas were without electrical power for close to 3 days.  Cayuga county eventually qualified to receive federal disaster relief money.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 20M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This particular derecho formed in South Dakota on the evening of Saturday, May 30th, and raced eastward at 70 mph across Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, before striking Michigan's Lower Peninsula around 4:30 am EDT Sunday morning, May 31st. The derecho event produced widespread 60 to 90 mph wind gusts, which caused extensive tree and structural damage and left over 861,000 homes and businesses without electricity across Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan). There were 4 storm-related fatalities reported in the state and 146 injuries (mostly minor). Statewide, approximately 250 homes were destroyed, 12,250 homes damaged, 34 businesses destroyed, and 829 businesses damaged. Damage estimates across the above listed counties totaled over $166 Million. 	NWS Storm Damage Field Studies suggested highest wind gusts in wet microbursts reached 120 to 130 mph in Spring Lake (Ottawa County) and Walker (Kent County), 100 mph in portions of Montcalm County (including Cody Lake and Stanton), 90 mph in Rockford (Kent County) and Zeeland (Ottawa County), and 80 mph in Big Rapids (Mecosta County), Ludington (Mason County), Sparta (Kent County), and northern Osceola County. On June 24th, President Clinton declared 13 Michigan counties federal disaster areas, including the following 10 from the NWSO Grand Rapids County Warning Area: Clinton, Gratiot, Ionia, Kent, Mason, Montcalm, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oceana, and Ottawa. It took up to 10 days to fully restore power to certain areas including the City of Walker and portions of Montcalm and Gratiot Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Michigan State Police EMD's Damage and Injury Assessment Report indicated $4,336,751 in public damage costs, 53 injuries, 63 homes destroyed, 1196 homes damaged, 15 businesses destroyed, and 173 businesses damaged in Kent County, excluding the City of Grand Rapids (see separate Grand Rapids report). Private damage costs were estimated to be approximately $45.0 Million in the city of Walker alone. No other private damage costs were available from across the county. The storm damage was most severe in the cities of Rockford and Walker. Most city streets within the city limits of Rockford and Walker were left impassable. The city of Walker was closed to the public. Michigan State Police troopers assisted the city of Walker with security and a dawn to dusk curfew was enforced. A team from the Michigan National Guard was sent to the city of Walker to assist in debris removal and cleanup operations. Most of Walker was left without power as the power line infrastructure was destroyed. Damaged and destroyed businesses left 8,403 people unemployed. The Kent County fruitbelt, covering much of the northwest part of the county, received an estimated $20.0 Million in damages due to snapped and uprooted trees. Most damage was done to apple trees, but cherry and peach orchards were also damaged. Kent County declared a local state of emergency (as did the city of Walker) and was granted a Governor's disaster declaration to activate state assistance for the county. On June 24th, President Clinton granted a Major Disaster Declaration for Kent County, making available federal disaster assistance.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 49.34M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Overall, damage was dominated by numerous downed trees, large limbs, and power lines, though there were scattered occurrences of large hail.Montgomery Co was hardest hit.  Though no one area received major damage, nearly all communities in the eastern two-thirds of the county had some trees, large limbs, or wires down.  A portion of Woodfield Road (state route 124) was closed north of Gaithersburg; dozens of trees and large limbs were down along the state route 28 corridor from Darnestown to Rockville.  Farther south, fallen trees closed a portion of Persimmon Tree Road in Potomac.  The most harrowing experience occurred in Glen Echo, where two vehicles were damaged by a large limb and falling wires.  The two males were rescued; the woman was brought to a nearby hospital for observation.  In all, county emergency management officials reported a dozen trees on houses and several others on vehicles across the county.  The combination of wind and lightning knocked out power to over 40,000 Potomac Electric Power Co. customers in Montgomery and Prince George's Cos.Across northeastern Maryland, tree damage was confined to smaller limbs and some wires.  However, a slower moving storm dropped at least 1 1/2 inches of rain across central and eastern Harford Co, creating a period of flash flooding which required at least one rescue of a stranded vehicle.  Several reports of street flooding were received from both Aberdeen and Havre de Grace.Earlier, tree and wire damage was noted in southern Carroll and western Howard Cos, with the more substantial damage in Howard.  Baltimore Gas and Electric reported at least 10,000 customers lost electricity in these areas at the peak of the storm.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 100K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The low moved rapidly east that night, reaching northern lower Michigan by daybreak on the 31st.  The warm front associated with the low moved north across the Lower Peninsula overnight, ushering in an unstable air mass.  A potent upper level disturbance also moved east across Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st.  Wind speeds were extremely high aloft, with 65 mph winds located less than a half mile above ground level.Thunderstorms developed in the northern Plains during the afternoon of the 30th.  The storms organized and accelerated as they headed east.  The thunderstorm complex evolved into a serial derecho as it crossed eastern Wisconsin and Lake Michigan.  The derecho affected most of lower Michigan during the early morning hours of the 31st, producing one of the most widespread wind damage events in state history.  The derecho moved east across the state at about 70 mph.Two fatalities were directly attributed to the storms in southeast Michigan.  In Pinconning in Bay County, a woman was killed when a tree fell on her home as she slept.  In Port Crescent State Park, just southwest of Port Austin in Huron County, a tent occupied by two people was struck by a falling tree, killing one of the occupants (the other was unhurt).  Two injuries occurred at the Holly State Recreation Area in Oakland County.  Both were campers who were hurt in separate incidents by falling trees.  One suffered a possible broken leg, while the other may have suffered broken ribs.In southeast Michigan, wind damage generally increased as you went north.  Most of Metro Detroit saw only patchy wind damage.  Widespread damage began in the far northern suburbs of Detroit, and continued north into Flint, the Tri Cities, and the Thumb.  Most of the damage done to structures was caused by falling trees.Midland County was the first southeast Michigan county to experience the derecho.  Structural damage was reported in Porter, Warren, Edenville, Hope, and Jerome Townships.  Outbuildings were the most vulnerable to the wind, with many barns, sheds, and garages damaged or destroyed.  Trees and power lines down were a common sight countywide.  Consumers Power reported that thirteen thousand customers in the Midland area lost power due to the thunderstorms.Damage was widespread in Bay County.  Bay City was especially hard hit, with many trees down and a gas main broken.  The city clock tower had one of its faces torn off, and the drawbridge across the Saginaw River had all four gates snapped off.  The Coast Guard Station in nearby Essexville recorded an 81 mph wind gust.  Eleven thousand Bay City area residents were without power at the height of the storm. Again, trees and power lines down were a common problem countywide.  Crews were still cleaning up debris almost two months after the storms went through.  Public damage alone was estimated at $610,000.  President Clinton declared Bay County a Federal Disaster Area.Saginaw County also received a Federal Disaster Declaration.  Damage was most widespread in the northern and eastern parts of the county.  Townships hardest hit were Jonesfield, Richland, Bridgeport, Thomas, Birch Run, Carlton, Kochville, and Tittabawassee.  Also hard hit were the cities of Saginaw and Zilwaukee.  The Tri Cities International Airport recorded an 86 mph wind gust, while a spotter near Oakley estimated 70 mph winds.  Several homes suffered structural damage, with most of the damage again caused by fallen trees.  Public damage alone was estimated at $750,000.  Fifty-eight thousand Consumers Power customers in the Saginaw area lost power at the height of the storm, and it took over a week to get power restored in some places.The other county in southeast Michigan to receive a Federal Disaster Declaration was Shiawassee.  A spotter north of Laingsburg estimated 89 mph winds, while another spotter just northeast of Henderson reported 70 mph winds.  The hardest hit areas in the county included Owosso, Durand, and Fairfield Township.  In Owosso, over half a million dollars in damage was done to the high school alone.  About 25,000 Owosso area residents lost power during the storm.  All told, fifty homes and twenty-six businesses in Shiawassee County were damaged, along with about fifty agricultural outbuildings.  The derecho felled about five thousand trees in the county.The Thumb counties of Huron, Tuscola, and Sanilac also experienced damaging winds.  Numerous barns were deroofed in the west half of Huron County, and a pair of utility plants were damaged.  A gazebo in Wagener Park, between Harbor Beach and White Rock, was destroyed.  In Tuscola County, the wind was estimated in the 70 to 85 mph range by the Michigan State Police at their Caro post.  Property damage was extensive in the Caro area, including a tree that fell through the roof of the county building.  Unionville was also hit hard, with several homes struck by falling trees.  County officials estimated 70 mph winds in the Millington area.  Windows were blown out a home in the extreme southeast corner of the county, just west of Marlette.  Across the county line in Sanilac County, plate glass windows were blown out of downtown businesses in Brown City.  Several mobile homes in the northwest part of the county suffered extensive damage.  Numerous outbuildings were destroyed in Sanilac County, mainly in the western half.  The steeple was torn off of a church in Melvin.  Other communities that saw damage included New Greenleaf, Marlette, Peck, Deckerville, Shabonna, and Minden.The only tornado of the morning in southeast Michigan occurred in far western Genesee County.  The weak tornado only touched down for a few moments, but was observed by a spotter downing trees and damaging buildings.  Elsewhere across Genesee County, tree damage was widespread.  The Fenton area saw the most extensive damage, but Grand Blanc and Flint also had significant problems.  Over a hundred thousand Consumers Power customers in the Flint area lost power at the height of the storm.  The widespread wind damage continued east into Lapeer County, with hundreds of trees downed.  Imlay City, Lapeer, and Almont were among the hardest hit communities in Lapeer County.Still more damage occurred in the next county over, St Clair County.  Trees and power lines were down across much of the county.  Damage was most extensive in Capac, Yale, Port Huron, and Marysville.  In Port Huron, an historic elm tree - believed to be the oldest in the county - fell onto a church.  This was just one of dozens of trees to be felled in Port Huron.  All told, one home in St Clair County was destroyed, and thirty were damaged.Livingston County was yet another county that saw widespread damage to trees and power lines, although the damage was not quite as extensive.  A National Weather Service employee estimated 60 mph winds near Brighton.  Fowlerville, Howell, and Hartland also experienced severe winds.  In Oakland County, damage was heavy and extensive in the northern part of the county.  A gust of 67 mph was measured at the National Weather Service office in White Lake, while a Weather Service employee measured 61 mph winds in Oxford.  Several homes in the Oxford area suffered roof damage, two large signs were downed, and a trampoline simply disappeared.  Holly, Ortonville, Clarkston, and Orion Township also saw substantial damage to trees.  Further south, damage became patchy.  A swath of damaging winds downed trees from South Lyon east to Novi.  A lightning strike in South Lyon started a house fire.  Gusts estimated at 70 mph knocked boats off of hoists on Cass Lake.In Macomb County, extensive damage occurred in the village of Armada.  Winds estimated at 90 mph downed dozens of trees in the village.  The Governor of Michigan declared Armada a state disaster area.  This swath of damage started southwest of Armada in Romeo, where trees and lines were downed.  The swath continued east of Armada to Richmond - where a barn was destroyed - and Memphis - where two homes were damaged by fallen trees.  Damage was only patchy in the southern part of Macomb County, with tree damage reported in Fraser and St Clair Shores.  Twenty homes and ten businesses were damaged in Macomb County.Only the trailing edge of the derecho crossed Washtenaw and Wayne Counties, and the thunderstorms there moved much more slowly.  Wind damage was therefore nowhere near as extensive.  Power lines were downed in the Dexter area in Washtenaw County.  Lightning triggered a house fire in Ypsilanti.  In Wayne County, trees and power lines were downed in Northville and Livonia.  A pocket of damage also occurred in Dearborn, where a church steeple was damaged, a garage was hit by a falling utility pole, and a house was struck by lightning.  All told, 215,000 Detroit Edison customers lost power at some point in the storm.To wind up the event, an isolated severe thunderstorm developed on the southern edge of the derecho as it was moving east into Ontario.  This cell produced large hail in Rockwood and South Rockwood.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 35K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The storms focused on a pair of east-west oriented boundaries: one stretched across central lower Michigan, while the second was a weak warm front moving north into the southern portion of the state.  Thunderstorms near both boundaries became severe.Storms near the northern boundary were hail producers.  Golfball sized hail was reported by a spotter in Sanford, and also by the Michigan State Police northwest of Pinconning.  Dime to quarter sized hail was reported at a number of other locations in Midland and Bay Counties.Along the warm front, a large supercell developed in south-central Michigan.  It moved east and then turned southeast across southeast Michigan.  Hardest hit was Washtenaw County, most notably around Chelsea, and from Milan to Whittaker.  These locations were affected by parts of the supercell for an extended period of time.  Severe weather started in the area around and north of Chelsea, where golfball sized hail fell.  A lightning strike started a house fire north of Chelsea.  Quarter sized hail fell in Chelsea about 20 minutes later, but this part of the storm was more noted for the wind damage it caused.  Trees were downed in Sylvan, Chelsea, and Lima.  A truck was destroyed by a fallen tree in Sylvan, and a few homes in Chelsea were damaged in a similar manner.  Wind gusts also destroyed in barn in Lima.  The wind was estimated at 75 mph in Chelsea.The supercell covered the Milan-Whittaker area with golfball sized hail.  A spotter in Whittaker estimated 70 mph winds.  Again, a second component of the large supercell caused severe weather 15 to 20 minutes later.  This one also produced golfball sized hail in Milan, and emergency management officials estimated 70 mph winds just west of Whittaker.Although not hit as hard, the Ann Arbor-Ypsilanti area also saw severe weather.  A spotter in Ann Arbor estimated 60 mph winds on the fringe of the supercell, while a spotter in Ypsilanti saw golfball sized hail and 75 mph winds.  Another spotter in Pittsfield saw dime sized hail.The supercell continued southeast into Lenawee and Monroe Counties.  Only the northeast corner of Lenawee County was grazed, as trees were downed near Macon.  Monroe County took a more substantial hit.  A golfer at Thorn Hills Golf Club, northeast of Maybee, was hurt when a large tree limb fell on him.  Trees were also downed in Dundee and Raisinville Township.  A spotter estimated 60 mph winds in Maybee, as did emergency management officials just south of Carleton.  Dime sized hail fell at the Fermi II Nuclear Power Plant.  Finally, a sheriff just east of Temperance estimated a gust of 60 mph.This supercell would go on to cause substantial damage in northern Ohio.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 15K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

One of these storms developed into a supercell over southern Barry County. This supercell thunderstorm propagated east-southeast across Calhoun and Jackson Counties from approximately 4:20 pm until 5:45 pm EDT and spawned an F1 tornado and two damaging microbursts. The microburst which hit Pennfield Township in Calhoun County killed a 75-year old male and injured 2 females (one of which, a 13-year old female, was critically injured) when their respective modular homes were destroyed. NWS Grand Rapids officials estimated wind speeds reached 120 mph in the Pennfield Township downburst. The tornado did not result in any deaths or injuries, but did approximately $50,000 in damage just south of Bedford in Calhoun County.	Overall, downed trees and power lines and lightning strikes knocked out power to 22,000 in southern Michigan, most of which occurred in Barry, Calhoun, and Wayne Counties (in southeast Lower Michigan).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The same supercell thunderstorm which produced the F1 tornado in northwest Calhoun County produced a wet microburst as it moved across Pennfield Township. The downburst caused one fatality and 2 injuries approximately 1/2 mile south of Pennfield High School, just east of the Battle Creek River in the vicinity of Pony Street and Clarence Blvd. Approximately 12 homes sustained varying degrees of damage in this location. Two modular homes on adjacent properties along Clarence Blvd. were blown off their foundations and destroyed. A 75 year old man in the northernmost structure was killed, while a teenage girl who occupied the neighboring home was critically injured and her mother sustained minor injuries. A 20 foot camping trailer was hurled in a grove of small trees over 100 feet away and was demolished. In addition, several vehicles were damaged. A damage survey conducted by the National Weather Service Office in Grand Rapids revealed a unidirectional damage pattern associated with straight-line winds. It appeared a powerful wet microburst occurred in Pennfield Township as the severe thunderstorm mesocyclone weakened. Wind speeds were estimated to have reached 120 mph at the damage site.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's "gust front" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently "microbursts" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's "gust front" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently "microbursts" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.  Overall, approximately twelve people sustained injuries and damage was estimated around $16 million.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This particular derecho formed in South Dakota on the evening of Saturday, May 30th, and raced eastward at 70 mph across Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, before striking Michigan's Lower Peninsula around 4:30 am EDT Sunday morning, May 31st. The derecho event produced widespread 60 to 90 mph wind gusts, which caused extensive tree and structural damage and left over 861,000 homes and businesses without electricity across Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Consumers Energy reported the derecho event was the most destructive weather event in its history, leaving over 600,000 of its customers without power (Consumers Energy is the largest utility company in western and mid Lower Michigan). There were 4 storm-related fatalities reported in the state and 146 injuries (mostly minor). Statewide, approximately 250 homes were destroyed, 12,250 homes damaged, 34 businesses destroyed, and 829 businesses damaged. Damage estimates across the above listed counties totaled over $166 Million. 	NWS Storm Damage Field Studies suggested highest wind gusts in wet microbursts reached 120 to 130 mph in Spring Lake (Ottawa County) and Walker (Kent County), 100 mph in portions of Montcalm County (including Cody Lake and Stanton), 90 mph in Rockford (Kent County) and Zeeland (Ottawa County), and 80 mph in Big Rapids (Mecosta County), Ludington (Mason County), Sparta (Kent County), and northern Osceola County. On June 24th, President Clinton declared 13 Michigan counties federal disaster areas, including the following 10 from the NWSO Grand Rapids County Warning Area: Clinton, Gratiot, Ionia, Kent, Mason, Montcalm, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oceana, and Ottawa. It took up to 10 days to fully restore power to certain areas including the City of Walker and portions of Montcalm and Gratiot Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Michigan State Police EMD's Damage and Injury Assessment Report indicated $150,000 in public damage costs, another $150,000 in private property damage, 2000 homes damaged, 10 homes destroyed, and 10 businesses damaged. Two injuries were reported. Most of the significant damage was reported across the northern portion of the county including the cities of Belding, Muir, and Pewamo and the townships of Otisco, Orleans, Ronald, North Plains, and Lyons. Ionia County declared a local state of emergency and was granted a Governor's disaster declaration to activate state assistance to the county. On June 24th, President Clinton granted a Major Disaster Declaration for Ionia County, making federal disaster assistance available.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Thunderstorms fired up as warm air over ran the cooler air at the surface.  Storms formed over Nebraska and moved into western Iowa during the mid evening hours, then continued to advance east across the state.  For the most part the storms produced high winds with wind gusts to 70 MPH or more at times.  Winds gusted to 77 MPH west of Greenfield in Adair County.  There were numerous reports of trees and power lines downed.  One injury occurred in Union County as campers were overturned at Green Valley State Park by the high winds. Another injury occurred in Cass County when 65 to 80 MPH winds blew through.  Three semi-tractortrailers and one car were overturned by high winds in Interstate 80.   There were also many reports of farm sheds and buildings being damaged or destroyed by the winds.  Some building damage was reported in Creston.  A barn and farm shed was destroyed by high winds in Wayne County near Seymour.  Early in the storms development, a small tornado touched down in Cass County north of Anita.  The tornado destroyed several sheds and grain bins there.  In addition to the wind, there were numerous reports of marble size hail.  Hail was not a major event with these storms however.  The only large hail reports came early on in the event with golf ball size hail at Brayton in Audubon County, and one inch diameter hail reported in Cass County northwest of Atlantic.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A weak shortwave trough would interact with this boundary by late afternoon producing another outbreak of severe thunderstorms.  Capes the afternoon of the 21st exceeded 5000 J/kg thanks in part to surface dewpoints in the mid 70s and mid level cold air advection under the approaching mid level shortwave.  An east-west line of multicellular severe thunderstorms quickly developed along the front by late afternoon.  As the convectively generated cold pool deepened... a large outflow boundary developed and began to spread southward generating new convection along the leading edge.  Very heavy rain fell within this line of storms as they pushed slowly south as evidenced by reported rainfall amounts.  Many locations experienced wet microbursts within the stronger multicell storms.  Freezing level temperatures and wet bulb zero temperatures were quit high which greatly inhibited large hail formation.   The convective outflow weakened later that evening with echo training developing across central Indiana which went on to produce widespread flash flooding during the morning of July 22nd.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> ONE MAN ENDED UP PARALYZED WHEN A LARGE TREE LIMB FELL ONTO HIS CAR.

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's "gust front" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently "microbursts" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.  Overall, approximately twelve people sustained injuries and damage was estimated around $16 million.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Several areas in Champaign County sustained considerable damage caused by microbursts (100 to 110 mph) as the thunderstorms marched across the county.  Just south of Willard Airport, a mobile home was destroyed.  A woman inside the mobile home sustained minor injuries as the home was rolled off its foundation and disintegrated.  A nearby roofing business literally lost its roof.  In the same general area, two semis were blown over on I-57 with one driver sustaining minor injuries. Further south, just south of Tolono, 21 cars of a freight train were blown off the tracks.  No injuries were reported with that incident.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's "gust front" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently "microbursts" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.  Overall, approximately twelve people sustained injuries and damage was estimated around $16 million.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Initially, the surface warm front was located to the south of this system.  That was not actually the case aloft however.  During the predawn hours the surface front surged north and by sunrise was located across northeast Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable to the south of the front with dew point temperatures will in the 70s F.  The initial development of thunderstorms took place during the early part of the day over northeast Nebraska.  The storms became severe quickly as they moved and developed eastward into Iowa.  By mid morning, the storms had formed a nearly east to west line.  Storm relative inflow into the line was around 40 knots.  The storms produced a variety of severe weather across Iowa.  They initially moved east across the northern and central counties, but then began sinking sinking southeast.  The dominant severe weather with the storms was extremely high winds.  Damage was very widespread across the state.  Winds in excess of 100 MPH were reported with one unofficial wind speed measured at 126 MPH in the town of Washington at 1405 CST.  In one unusual story, high winds hit Mahaska County.  Three miles south of New Sharon, a puppy was tied to its dog house which was picked up by the wind.  The dog house and puppy were lifted over the top of a two car garage and a corn crib.  Both were deposited in the farm yard.  When found the dog house was upside down and the puppy, though scared, was fine.  There were several tornadoes during the event.  One of the longer track well defined tornadoes was the initial tornado.  It was on the ground for about 11 miles as it swept across Crawford County.  Several residences, outbuildings, grain bins, and trees were damaged along its path.  Reports indicate that between 30 and 50 residences were damaged by this tornado.  There were several small tornadoes in central Iowa.  They had short tracks and only touched down briefly.  One cut a mile long path east of Marshalltown through a corn field and a grove of trees.  Another in Dallas County was on the ground through mostly open country for two miles.  High winds were a major problem with these storms.  Many places reported winds over 80 MPH with incredible tree damage and numerous buildings damaged or destroyed.  At least 38 counties were declared disaster areas by the Federal Government due to the severe damage and flooding.  A final total will not be available before publication deadlines, however preliminary data have been included.  In the Des Moines County Warning Area these included:  Wright, Franklin, Butler, Bremer, Hamilton, Hardin, Grundy, Crawford, Carroll, Greene, Boone, Story, Marshall,  Audubon, Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Jasper, Cass, Adair, Madison, Warren, Marion, Adams, and Taylor.  One of the hardest hit Counties was Polk County.  Damage appeared to be from straight line winds based on a storm survey that was done following the event.  The damage occurred over the southwest semicircle of a large meso low in contact with the ground.  Due to the rapid translational speed of 50 to 75 MPH, winds were enhanced on the southwest semicircle of the meso low.  Smaller scale winds could have been embedded within this circulation as well.  There was little evidence of small scale convergent tornadic damage, however aerial surveys did make some suggestion and eye witness accounts of sightings were quite numerous in the metro Des Moines area.  All trees and debris were laid down to the south or southeast.  The major damage swath as 3 to 7 miles wide northwest of Camp Dodge, with a widening into a full blown derecho after that.  The event was born a few miles northwest of Perry, between Rippey and Berkley in southwest Boone County.  The mile wide damage path expanded to over 3 miles by the time it reached full intensity near highway 169 between Woodward and Perry.  The path continued through Granger, Camp Dodge, and Johnston.  The path was nearly 7 miles wide near Granger.  A second, smaller, meso low passed near Madrid, downing power lines.  This meso low matured near Jester Park Golf Course, causing significant structural damage to houses.  The two meso lows merged near the NWS Forecast Office in Johnston, with two miles of power poles snapped off between Johnston and Granger.  Much of the damage along the most severe track was in the F1 intensity category, with speeds in the 75 to 110 MPH range.  A few spots along the path, such as in the Granger and Camp Dodge area, sustained sufficient damage to justify F2 winds, 110 to 155 MPH.  It appears a tornado or family of tornadoes touched down southeast of Berkley and moved southeast into the Pleasant Hill area just east of Des Moines.  The track was intermittent, indicating either one tornado touching down occasionally, or one or more weak tornadoes rotating around the meso circulation.  The worst effected metro areas were the Granger area, Johnston, and the northeast side of Des Moines proper.  A duplex in Granger was flattened by the winds.  There were several reports of roofs being ripped off of stores and houses in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Several small private planes were flipped at a small air field north of Des Moines.  There were also several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being blown over on Interstate 35.  Heavy construction equipment was overturned on Interstate 35/80 just north of Des Moines.  Damage was extensive to the east side of Des Moines proper.  To make matters worse, following the passage of the main line of thunderstorms, a second line of severe thunderstorms developed and moved across the same areas already hit.  The storms were smaller, but did produce brief tornado touch downs and hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter.  The second line of storms did eventually combine with the first and moved southeast across the rest of the state.  Damage was widespread across the state and it will be months before final numbers are in.  Estimates from Polk County alone are near $100 million in damage including cleanup.  Totals were still being tallied at this writing, however a few include over $11 million in damage from initial claims in Johnston and $726,000 from West Des Moines just to city buildings and systems.  West Des Moines was on the far west edge of the major damage however.  In addition to the property damage, at least 125 people were injured during the storm.  Most of the injuries were caused by flying debris and many were not serious.  Fortunately there were no fatalities.  Heavy damage was reported by MidAmerica Energy.  On a state wide report, they indicated 200,000 homes  were without electricity, effecting over 500,000 people, at one time during the storm.  In the metropolitan Des Moines area, 100,000 homes were without electricity at the height of the storm.  That number was reduced to around 25,000 36 hours later.  The worst damaged areas were without power for 5 to 6 days.  Heavy damage was also reported by local telephone and cable systems.  In Polk County, the worst damage extended from the Camp Dodge area into the northeast parts of Des Moines.  At least 462 homes in the metro Des Moines area sustained significant damage.  Statewide, 80 homes were destroyed, 559 sustained severe damage, with 1416 others receiving moderate damage.  In the Camp Dodge area, 80 to 90 percent of the brick buildings were damaged with the roofs removed from many of them.  Lightning from the storms struck the WSR-88D in the midst of the storm.  The radar was taken out of service for more than 24 hours because of this.  In addition to the severe weather, flooding quickly became a problem.  Iowa soil was nearly saturated as the weather pattern had been very wet for six weeks previous.  Although rainfall was not extreme, one to three inches of rain fell over a several county area.  This caused widespread urban flooding across north central into central Iowa, though damage from the flooding was not serious.  Crop damage was very difficult to determine and will not likely be clear until the fall harvest.  Reports from some of the local extension agents say damage to the corn ranged up to 75% destroyed in areas with the highest wind, such as the swath that went through central Iowa in association with the tornado there.  No doubt losses will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not in the millions.   Accounts of damage were of course too numerous to document here as the areal extent of the storms was very large.  Countless reports of parts of crop fields being flattened were received.  Semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned by the high winds both in the Des Moines metro area as well as in Newton.  Trees were found on houses over a large part of the state.  One news reported wrote "there is not a power pole standing between Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa".  Though not figuratively true, this statement does point out the extensive damage that occurred with these storms.l<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 40M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

He was playing outdoors while his parents were clearing debris.  The limb was damaged during the storm and gave way.  The child suffered massive head injuries and died the next day.   Four roads were blocked by fallen trees in the township.  In Northern Bucks County, six major roadways were blocked by fallen trees in Nockamixon Township.  Downed trees blocked access to a few roads in Bridgeton Township.  Numerous power outages occurred in Erwinna, Kintnersville, Ottsville, Pipersville, Tinicum and Upper Black Eddy.  Farther south in Solebury Township damage was described as pretty extensive with many roads blocked by trees and wires.  In the Doylestown area six injuries occurred.  In New Britain Township, two people were injured when the trailer they occupied was blown into a tree at the Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa.  Tents were also damaged at the shrine.  In Buckingham Township, a woman was pinned under a fallen tree.  Another tree damaged a store.  In Doylestown itself, the brick facing of one home was torn down by the severe thunderstorm.  There were about 40 calls of downed trees and wires and at least one vehicle was crushed.  In Lower Bucks County trees and power lines were knocked down in Falls Township, Levittown, Middletown Township, Wrightstown Township and Yardley.  In Yardley, several large trees were knocked down.  They damaged a couple of vehicles, knocked off the gutters to one home and caused many detours.  In Middletown Township, a driver was uninjured when he drove into a downed tree on the road.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A 56-year-old man drowned in Sandy Hook Bay after his fishing boat rolled over.  About 30 persons were injured, mainly from hypothermia after their sailing vessels capsized mainly in Sandy Hook Bay.  The United States Coast Guard rescued about 60 persons from overturned boats.  Boats were described as being overturned left and right.  The 56-year-old man and his friend went fishing in a 14-foot-vessel.  They were about 500 to 600 yards north of Leonard State Marina near Atlantic Highlands when the squall line hit.  The boat apparently rolled over and the men were separated during the squall.  One managed to swim to shore, but the other gentleman perished.  In Sea Bright, lifeguards rescued persons hanging on to a capsized catamaran.  Almost every municipality at or near the shore reported downed trees and wires with some vehicles damaged.  Along the beaches umbrellas, chairs, towels, bags and boogie boards were tossed into the Atlantic.  Some of the worst damage included siding ripped from one home in Long Branch and the partial tear off of a Summit Bank's roof in Hazlet.  Wind damage was not confined to shore points either.  A wind gust to 75 mph was reported in Freehold.  The squall line also left a quarter mile wide strip of snapped poles in Millstone Township.     Service was suspended on New Jersey Transit's North Jersey Coast Line between Bay Head and Newark because of downed lines.  GPU energy reported 34,000 homes and businesses lost power in Monmouth and Ocean Counties.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> nan<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At least 22 tornadoes occurred throughout Oklahoma, of which seven were in northeast Oklahoma.  This outbreak of severe weather resulted as a powerful upper level storm system moved across the central plains and surface low pressure developed over southwest Oklahoma.  Warm humid air quickly invaded the area on the morning of October 4 and then collided with a cold front moving southward by evening.  The threat from these storms ran the full range of possibilities from destructive tornadoes to damaging winds to very large hail up to the size of baseballs.Numerous storms occurred on the evening of October 4, mainly north of Interstate 40.  The two most significant storms both moved eastward out of central Oklahoma.  One produced an F1 tornado that passed through Pawnee.  The other produced a 27-mile track F2 tornado that started in Okfuskee County and ended in Okmulgee County.  This second storm later went on to produce considerable hail and wind damage in the city of Okmulgee.  Many other thunderstorms developed during the evening in central Oklahoma, fanned by upper level winds in excess of 100 knots.  These storms moved into northeast Oklahoma, causing additional severe weather late in the evening that gradually spread eastward to the Arkansas state line.  After midnight, the storms congealed and became a slow-moving line of thunderstorms that sat over nearly the same area of northeast Oklahoma through the overnight hours.  The severe threat gradually diminished through the night, and flooding became the main problem.  For more information on the flooding, see the separate event entry for the flooding.  By late on the afternoon of October 5, the slow-moving line had moved into southeast Oklahoma and flared up during the heat of the afternoon, causing a few additional severe weather reports in the form of strong winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Two mobile homes were destroyed, and one home was damaged.  Two people were injured in this incident.  The location was 2 miles west of Ochelata just inside Osage County.

As the storms moved east at 40 to 50 mph, they produced high winds, large hail, and an isolated tornado.  Wind gusts from 60 to 80 mph downed many trees and power lines throughout the area.  The cost estimates of damage included above are preliminary figures submitted by the Nassau County Office of Emergency Management.In Richmond County, the following peak wind gusts were reported:  80 mph at Great Kills, the Verranzano Bridge, and in Richmond.  High winds downed trees and caused a building to collapse in Richmond.  One tree fell on and injured a man in Richmond.In New York County (Manhattan), high winds caused a building to collapse.In the Bronx, high winds downed a tree that fell on 3 people resulting in 1 death and 2 injuries in the courtyard of the Edenwald Houses at 1135 East 229th Street.In Kings County (Brooklyn), high winds downed and uprooted several large trees.  One tree fell on and injured a person at East 229th Street.  Five to 6-foot diameter trees were uprooted east of Coney Island in the Gerritsen Beach Section, where 3 funnel clouds were also sighted and a firefighter was injured from large hail.  Large trees also fell on and damaged cars in Bensonhurst.In Queens County, a peak wind gust of 62 mph was measured at both LaGuardia Airport and at JFK Airport.In Nassau County, the following peak wind gusts were reported:  75 mph in Farmingdale, 60 mph in Port Washington and Mineola and 58 mph at Farmingdale Republic Airport.  High winds downed large tree limbs at Rockville Center, Baldwin, and Oceanside and downed trees in Long Beach, Massapequa, and Valley Stream.  One-inch diameter hail dented cars and covered the ground in Farmingdale.In Suffolk County, high winds overturned many boats in the Great South Bay, downed large trees in West Babylon and Rocky Point and downed large tree limbs in Wading River.  One person died when a thunderstorm wind gust capsized a 19 foot sail boat in Great South Bay near Copiague.  A Centerport woman, 36, and her daughter, 3, were injured when a tree fell on them in the parking lot of the Ground Round Restaurant and CVS on Fort Salonga Road.   The following peak wind gusts were reported:  72 mph in Babylon and 65 mph in Fire Island.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The NWS confirmed that an F2 tornado was responsible for significant damage that occurred in Lynbrook.  Most of the village received damage from straight line winds up to 80 mph, that was associated with a severe squall line.  Downed trees covered the village with some structural damage where the F2 tornado touched down.The major path of damage was from the northwest section of Lynbrook east-southeast to the southeast section of the village.  Funnel clouds were observed from near the intersection of Marshall Ave. and Burtis Street and to the southeast.  A tornado was first sighted by two eyewitnesses on Hampton Place. It rose and touched down several times:  Second, near Winter Street and across Glover Circle; Third, along Peninsula Blvd. between Earle and Benton Avenues; and Fourth, as a weak F2 near the intersection of Rocklyn Ave. and Merrick Road.  It moved across the Long Island Railroad Tracks and Sunrise Highway before it finally dissipated.More than three hundred trees were blown over, many on houses and cars.  Six people received minor injuries.  Four of these were in "The Fun Zone" on Rocklyn Avenue.  One woman was slightly injured by a tree that fell on her car.  One police officer was also injured.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

At least 22 tornadoes occurred throughout Oklahoma, of which seven were in northeast Oklahoma.  This outbreak of severe weather resulted as a powerful upper level storm system moved across the central plains and surface low pressure developed over southwest Oklahoma.  Warm humid air quickly invaded the area on the morning of October 4 and then collided with a cold front moving southward by evening.  The threat from these storms ran the full range of possibilities from destructive tornadoes to damaging winds to very large hail up to the size of baseballs.Numerous storms occurred on the evening of October 4, mainly north of Interstate 40.  The two most significant storms both moved eastward out of central Oklahoma.  One produced an F1 tornado that passed through Pawnee.  The other produced a 27-mile track F2 tornado that started in Okfuskee County and ended in Okmulgee County.  This second storm later went on to produce considerable hail and wind damage in the city of Okmulgee.  Many other thunderstorms developed during the evening in central Oklahoma, fanned by upper level winds in excess of 100 knots.  These storms moved into northeast Oklahoma, causing additional severe weather late in the evening that gradually spread eastward to the Arkansas state line.  After midnight, the storms congealed and became a slow-moving line of thunderstorms that sat over nearly the same area of northeast Oklahoma through the overnight hours.  The severe threat gradually diminished through the night, and flooding became the main problem.  For more information on the flooding, see the separate event entry for the flooding.  By late on the afternoon of October 5, the slow-moving line had moved into southeast Oklahoma and flared up during the heat of the afternoon, causing a few additional severe weather reports in the form of strong winds.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A significant long-track tornado occurred on the evening of October 4, following a 27-mile track from 2 miles southeast of Boley in Okfuskee County to 3 miles southwest of Nuyaka in Okmulgee County.  The tornado first touched down in Okfuskee County at 1037 PM CDT and lifted over Okmulgee County at 1108 PM CDT.  (This Tornado entry covers that part of the track in Okfuskee County.  See the separate Tornado entry for details on the portion in Okmulgee County.)  The most significant damage to structures occurred near the communities of IXL and Haydenville, while much of the damage in the rural areas across which the tornado tracked consisted of downed/uprooted trees.In the small community of IXL, located on OK Hwy 48 north of Okemah, nearly every structure sustained at least some damage.  An NWS Storm Survey revealed F2 damage at IXL, where a house and two mobile homes were destroyed.  Pieces of one mobile home were found one-half mile away.  A local newspaper also reported four businesses and a public building at the IXL Park were destroyed.  Six houses and two more mobile homes sustained major damage, while another 21 houses and one mobile home sustained minor damage.In Haydenville, located north of Okemah on OK Hwy 56, two single-family houses and a mobile home were destroyed.  Three houses, three mobile homes, and one public building (the Haydenville Fire Station) sustained major damage.  Five houses and one business (the Haydenville Store) sustained minor damage.  An NWS Storm Survey revealed F2 damage just southwest of Haydenville, where a mobile home was completely destroyed.  Four people inside the trailer were injured, one of them critically.  The tie-downs on the double-wide trailer were snapped, and the home appeared to have travelled a significant distance before disintegrating.This tornado was unusual for the fact that it covered such a large area.  A survey showed that the damage path was at times 3 miles wide, lending credence to the idea that there were several smaller tornadoes circulating around the larger tornado.  The larger tornado reached as wide as 8/10 of a mile.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Casualties in south Florida included two drownings in a fishing boat that capsized near the Dry Tortugas and about 65 injuries, most of them minor, in the upper keys involving hurricane spawned tornadoes.  Losses are estimated at $50 million, including $20 million in crop damage. Much of the property damage was caused by five tornadoes, one of which reached a maximum intensity of F2, in the upper Keys.  A total of 646 dwellings were damaged in an area from Islamorada to north Key Largo.  Other tornadoes were observed in Broward, Palm Beach, and Collier counties. Widespread rainfall totals across south Florida averaged 6 to 8 inches with local amounts of 13 inches. The storm surge of 2 to 4 feet along the Keys and southwest Florida coast, and 1 to 2 feet along the southeast coast, produced minor flooding, beach erosion and damage to marine structures and vessels.  The maximum officially measured wind in south Florida was 52 knots (60 mph) with a peak wind of 57 knots (65 mph) at Fowey Rocks Light. The maximum wind on land was 35 knots (40 mph) with a peak wind of 48 knots (55 mph) at Key West International Airport. About 50,000 customers lost their electricity.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A multivortex tornado touched down just west of U.S. 1 near mile marker 100.  The tornado moved north northeast at 30 mph passing across ten housing subdivision, mostly mobile home parks.

Casualties in south Florida included two drownings in a fishing boat that capsized near the Dry Tortugas and about 65 injuries, most of them minor, in the upper keys involving hurricane spawned tornadoes.  Losses are estimated at $50 million, including $20 million in crop damage. Much of the property damage was caused by five tornadoes, one of which reached a maximum intensity of F2, in the upper Keys.  A total of 646 dwellings were damaged in an area from Islamorada to north Key Largo.  Other tornadoes were observed in Broward, Palm Beach, and Collier counties. Widespread rainfall totals across south Florida averaged 6 to 8 inches with local amounts of 13 inches. The storm surge of 2 to 4 feet along the Keys and southwest Florida coast, and 1 to 2 feet along the southeast coast, produced minor flooding, beach erosion and damage to marine structures and vessels.  The maximum officially measured wind in south Florida was 52 knots (60 mph) with a peak wind of 57 knots (65 mph) at Fowey Rocks Light. The maximum wind on land was 35 knots (40 mph) with a peak wind of 48 knots (55 mph) at Key West International Airport.

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 50K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first of 19 tornadoes occurred at 1425 CST  in Woods County 11 miles south-southwest of Dacoma. A media storm chaser observed this multiple vortex tornado as it touched down in southeastern Woods County and traveled northeast into western Alfalfa County before dissipating 4 miles northwest of Carmen. Damage was first reported south of Dacoma where an old abandoned house was damaged and a barn and garage were destroyed. As the tornado moved into western Alfalfa County, an office building at Carmen Field Limited Partnership and a local gas plant were completely destroyed. A modular home adjacent to the gas plant also had most of its roof blown off. Numerous witnesses described this tornado (F2) as very large and was at least a quarter of a mile wide. The 2nd tornado, an F0, developed on the salt flats 5 miles southeast of Cherokee in Alfalfa County and was seen by an Alfalfa County Sheriff's Deputy. The 3rd tornado was witnessed by a state trooper touching down very close to Highway 11, 5 miles west of Medford in Grant County, and was on the ground for less than one minute with no known damage (F0). As the thunderstorms associated with these tornadoes moved east, additional thunderstorms began to intensify farther south. Near Mountain Park in Kiowa County, Baseball size hail destroyed numerous car windshields. A short while longer, at 1638 CST, the 4th tornado was captured on video by a reliable storm chaser 9 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County. This tornado touched down for only a few seconds in an open field with no known damage (F0).Several storage buildings at a Lowe's Department Store in Ponca City in Kay County, were blown over by winds estimated between 80-90 mph. The 5th tornado touched down 2.5 miles southwest of Watonga in Blaine County and crossed US-270/281 two miles south of Watonga. The tornado continued to the northeast and finally dissipated about 9 miles east-northeast of Watonga. At least three homes suffered significant damage, one of which had its roof completely removed (F2). The 6th tornado was seen by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer 5 miles north of Medicine Park in Comanche County touching down briefly in an open field with no known damage (F0). The 7th tornado, an F1, touched down 6 miles southwest of Dover in Kingfisher County and traveled northeast for 7 miles, crossing Highway 81 near the Cimarron River, and dissipating 2 miles southeast of Dover. One haybarn was destroyed, while 1 residence and 5 barns were damaged. Numerous trees and power lines were also downed. The 8th tornado, an F0, touched down just west of the intersection of US-277 and SH-8, 1 mile north of Cyril in Caddo County, and moved east for one-half mile knocking down trees and power lines and causing minor roof damage in the extreme northeastern portion of Cyril.While straight-line winds damaged a roof at the Farmers Coop Association building, and a trailer home in Guthrie in Logan County at 1745 CST, the 9th tornado touched down at 1747 CST on or just south of Lake Carl Blackwell in Payne County, and was observed by numerous people in and near Stillwater. The tornado moved northeast over the lake, crossed into extreme southern Noble County, and over Lake McMurtry. Minor damage was reported in northern Payne County, however the worst damage occurred in southern Noble County as the tornado moved off of Lake McMurtry and severely damaged a mobile home (F1). The 10th tornado (F2) was witnessed by 3 firefighters 1 mile south of Highway 277 on Lake Burtshi Road 9 miles west-southwest of Ninnekah in Grady County, and was on the ground for 1.5 miles. One mobile home was disintegrated, while 2 others nearby were flipped over. Many well-structured homes sustained minor roof damage, and numerous trees were blown over, some onto homes and one onto an RV. A storage building was also destroyed. The 11th tornado, also an F2, touched down in Grady County, 4.5 miles north of Middleburg, damaging several mobile homes and outbuildings. One mobile home was completely destroyed in the Bridge Creek area while two others were blown over. Scattered tree damage continued for 5 miles into McClain county just to the southwest of the Newcastle city limits. Wind damage continued into the south part of Newcastle causing damage to trees and power lines. In addition to the tornado damage, straight-line winds overturned several tractor-trailers 7 miles south of Tuttle, also in Grady County, and destroyed a barn in Dibble in McClain County. Lightning also struck a house on Broadway in Norman in Cleveland County, causing a small fire at 1900 CST.The 12th tornado (F0) developed at 1926 CST 3 miles north of Newcastle in McClain County, and was observed by people from Norman, Moore and Newcastle. This tornado touched down just northeast of the intersection of I-44 and North 32nd Street north of Newcastle, and moved north into extreme western Cleveland County near SW 149th St. and Meridian Avenue, in southwest Oklahoma City. Damage was primarily to trees. The 13th tornado was one of the most destructive tornadoes of the outbreak, developing over the city of Moore in Cleveland County about 1/2 mile north of SW 19th Ave, just east of Santa Fe Ave. The tornado tracked almost due north at first, and then curved slightly east of north. Many homes lost all or parts of their roofs, leaving them uninhabitable, and one home lost a portion of an exterior wall. Sections of roofs were also torn off of a few warehouses as the tornado crossed Shields Ave. and then dissipated just west of I-35. The worst damage occurred along NW 12th Ave to the west of Janaway where F2 damage was observed. In total, 10 single-family residences were either destroyed or severely damaged; 8 multi-family buildings were severely damaged; and hundreds of other homes and businesses sustained minor damage. Damage estimates were near 2 million dollars. The 14th tornado touched down near EW 106 road and NS 346 Road 4 miles southeast of Meeker in Lincoln County, where light damage occurred to many trees. The tornado then moved northeast crossing EW 347 south of US 62. Damage was observed from just south of this intersection southward for about one mile. Just south of the intersection, trees were downed and a house received damage to the roof and porch. F2 damage occurred about 1/2 mile south of US 62, where three homes received significant roof damage, and an RV was pushed over onto its side. The tornado crossed US 62 with light damage to trees and minor damage to a house along the highway. The tornado likely dissipated just northeast of the intersection of US 62 and NS 347 Road. The 15th tornado, also an F2, developed a few minutes after the last tornado about 7 miles west of Prague. This tornado touched down near NS 348 road about 1/2 mile north of EW 106 Road where a mobile home received light damage. The tornado moved northeast crossing near the intersection of EW 105 Road and NS 349 Road, then grew in size and intensity before crossing US 62. A mobile home along US 62 just west of NS 350 Road was destroyed. The metal frame that supported the home and most of the contents was deposited northwest of the original location up to 150 yards. Other debris was thrown north-northeast across US 62. The tornado then continued northeast and damage was noted for 3/4 of a mile along NS 350 Road centered on US 62. Slight damage to trees and outbuildings was observed along NS 352 Road approximately 2 miles north of US 62. The tornado probably dissipated northeast of this point, although roads became inaccessibe due to flooding and made it difficult to determine the exact location. In addition, a 6 mile long swath of damaging straight-line winds accompanied this tornado from 6 miles west of Prague to 3 miles northwest of Prague, resulting in massive tree damage. Damaging straight-line winds were also responsible for blowing down trees and power lines in Shawnee in Pottowatomie County at 2010 CST, and for a wind gust of 64 mph at 2020 CST, 4 miles west-southwest of Guthrie in Logan County, measured by Oklahoma Mesonet.  Another tornado, the 16th of the outbreak, developed at about the same time 6 miles northwest of Prague, and moved northeast for 7 miles before dissipating 7 miles north-northeast of Prague. This tornado, rated an F1, touched down at the intersection of EW 102 Road and NS 350 Road where outbuildings received moderate damage. Less than 1/4 of a mile away on EW 102 Road, a mobile home was lifted and thrown east about 100 yards, uprooting a power pole while airborne. The mobile home was destroyed upon impact. All 6 family members who took shelter inside an interior closet were injured. All injuries were minor, except for the father who suffered broken ribs, a cracked pelvis and head injuries. He stayed overnight in a nearby hospital and was released the next day. As the tornado continued east-northeast along NS 352 Road, south of the community of Wilzetta, an outbuilding was unroofed, minor damage occurred to a house roof, and trees were uprooted. Tree and power line damage continued to about 2 or 3 miles east of Wilzetta. The tornado then turned more to the northeast as it crossed SH 99 where a mobile home received minor damage, 3 outbuildings were destroyed, a few logs at a sawmill were tossed, and trees were downed. Scattered tree damage was observed to just southwest of the intersection of NS 357 Road and EW 99 Road where the tornado lifted. In addition to the tornadoes near Prague, straight-line winds were responsible for downing numerous trees and awnings of several businesses in downtown Prague.Farther south in Pottawatomie County, 2 tornadoes (Numbers 17 and 18 of the outbreak) embedded in larger swaths of damaging straight-line winds, developed near Shawnee. The first one touched down 3 miles northwest of Shawnee and remained on the ground for 3 miles before dissipating 3 miles north of Shawnee. A large swath of damaging straight-line winds approximately 1 mile wide and 4 miles long accompanied this F1 tornado as it moved across northern portions of Shawnee. Extensive tree damage occurred on a private golf course just west of Acme road. Minor damage also occurred to the roof of the clubhouse and to the roof-mounted air conditioning unit. Widespread tree and roof damage also occurred in a subdivision south of 45th St. and west of Kickapoo. In addition to a mobile home being destroyed near the east end of the damage path, which is believed to be the result of a tornado, many other mobile homes nearby received minor damage. In addition, 1 mile southeast of Dale in Pottowatomie County, numerous trees and signs were either destroyed or uprooted along Interstate 40; a shed was destroyed, and a barn was unroofed along Highway 102. Oklahoma Mesonet also measured a wind gust of 72 mph at 2055 CST, 3 miles north-northwest of Shawnee.The 2nd tornado, also an F1 and the 18th tornado of the outbreak, developed in or very close to the Shawnee business district, moved east for 2 miles, and was also accompanied by a large area of damaging straight-line winds. The exact damage resulting from the tornado was difficult to assess, but it is believed it was limited to fallen trees, downed power lines, and minor roof and structural damage to many homes. The area of straight-line wind damage was approximately 2.5 miles wide and 5 miles long, and occurred from the western side of Shawnee to the eastern side of Shawnee. Damage included widespread fallen trees in a suburban area north of Highland extending several blocks either side of Kickapoo, in the Woodland Park area, Boy Scout Park, and in the rural area along and south of Farrel Road between Harrison and Bryan. One tree fell on and heavily damaged the Beard House, a local landmark that was the first homestead built in Shawnee in 1895. An east-facing cinder block wall of a warehouse was blown outward in the vicinty of Minnesota and Pennsylvania Streets, and structural damage occurred to many buildings in downtown Shawnee, including toppled brick walls and broken windows. The combination of widespread straight-line wind damage and a tornado resulted in major damage over a very large area.       The 19th and last tornado of the outbreak touched down 5 miles west-northwest of Little, near the intersection of EW 114 Road and NS 351 Road in northwestern Pottowatomie County, where minor tree damage was observed. The tornado, an F3, then increased in size to approximately a 1/2 mile wide as it moved northeast. As it crossed NS 351 Road and then EW 113 Road, a number of outbuildings were heavily damaged, and trees were snapped. Three mobile homes received light damage near the north edge of the path, and 3 other homes received light damage to shingles. The tornado crossed Interstate 40 blowing over a truck which was carrying hazardous materials. The tornado then continued northeast unroofing a mobile home, causing damage to trees and destroying a number of outbuilding before crossing the North Canadian River into northeast Pottawatomie County. Along EW 110 Road, significant tree damage was observed, and a barn was partially unroofed. The community of Center View near the intersection of SH 99 and EW 109 Road was then hard hit with most of the damage south and east of this intersection. From the debris pattern, the center of the tornado crossed Highway 99 one-half mile south of EW 109 Road. A house along Highway 99 was unroofed and lost most of its exterior walls. Three homes suffered major damage along EW 109 Road. Two other homes suffered significant damage. As the tornado continued moving northeast another home suffered significant roof damage, and the south facing brick wall was buckled. The garage was destroyed. Steel and cinder block from the garage were impaled in a tree. There was also significant damage to large trees. Farther northeast, damage to a roof was noted, and a large number of power lines were downed along NS 357 Road near the intersection of EW 108 Road. One outbuilding was damaged, and light damage was observed in trees just south of EW 107 Road.  In total, at least 60 homes or businesses were damaged.      Major flooding developed across Noble, Lincoln, and Payne Counties shortly after midnight on the 5th. Red Rock Creek and Black Bear Creek near Red Rock in Payne County, overflowed their banks between Highway 77 and Interstate 35 washing away several small bridges. Damage was estimated at 200 thousand dollars. Six to seven inches of rain fell across a large portion of Lincoln County. At least 3 bridges were washed away by the floods including 1 bridge 1 mile east of Kendrick, and dozens of roads suffered erosion damage. Creeks also overflowed their banks in Stroud, Davenport, and Agra. At least 500 thousand dollars in damage resulted. Between 4 and 5 inches of rain fell across Payne County forcing the Cu Chee Creek to overflow its banks, flooding many roads in Cushing and Stillwater.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first tornado occurred around 0730 CST 10 miles south of Poplarville, MS and destroyed two mobile homes, damaged seven cars, and caused one injury.  A second weak tornado briefly touched down near Bay St. Louis, MS around 0850 CST resulting in only minor damage.Isolated flash flooding also occurred with Tropical Storm Hermine on September 20th when 4 to 5 inches of rain fell on areas of  Walthall county.

Seven persons were injured (five within Lyons).  About 40 homes were either destroyed or damaged in Lyons, Maiden Creek, Maxatawny and Richmond Townships.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire event were placed at $1.5 million dollars. About 10,250 homes and businesses lost power.  The last homes to come back on line were in Lyons on June 3rd.  This was the first tornado of that strength to occur in Southeast Pennsylvania and the Southern Poconos since the Limerick Tornado on July 27, 1994 and the first F3 tornado to occur within Berks County since November 4, 1950. Even before the tornado formed, the parent thunderstorm was producing wind damage in western Berks County.  Wind damage started in Centre Township as several trailers were overturned in Donny Acres.  In Leesport, the severe thunderstorm ripped the entire roof off one home.  The couple in the house was temporarily trapped after the porch roof they use to access the stairs collapsed.  The thunderstorm also ripped the roof and some bricks off a detached garage.  Other houses and buildings on East Main Street also had some minor wind damage.  Debris from a knitting company's air conditioning unit pelted a neighborhood.  Wind damage also occurred in Ontelaunee Tonship along Pennsylvania State Route 61.The tornado made its initial touchdown just to the east of Lake Ontelaunee in Maiden Creek Township around 9 p.m. EDT and moved almost due east across Richmond Township into the borough of Lyons (about 910 p.m. EDT), across southern Maxatawny Township and lifted in northern Rockland Township and 915 p.m. EDT.   The tornado was on the ground for about 8.3 miles.  Its path width was around 120 yards.The tornado destruction started near U.S. Route 222 in Maiden Creek Township as the roof was blown off one farmhouse.  A vehicle was also crushed by a tree.  In Maxatawny Township six homes were severely damaged.  One house collapsed on Smoketown Road in the Bowers area.   A second house lost its roof in the Arrowhead Development.  The damage increased across Richmond Township as 10 homes or farms were destroyed or damaged.  Pennsylvania State Route 662 was closed between U.S Route 222 and the Fleetwood Borough line because of downed poles and trees.   Parts of U.S. Route 222 were also closed because of debris on the road.   One house completely collapsed.  At one farm the tornado toppled a huge silo and ripped off the roofs of another silo and the barn.  At another home, the remains of a large metal storage bin rested on top of the house.  Golf ball size hail also damaged two vehicles and a metal awning.  The same parent thunderstorm also produced straight line wind damage farther south in Ruscombmanor Township.The worst damage occurred in the borough of Lyons.  The north side of the borough was destroyed.  About one quarter of the borough's 550 residents were affected by the tornado.  The tornado damage within this borough led to a presidential declaration of a disaster area for Berks County.  About 100 residents were sheltered.  The tornado cut a two block wide path along Hunter Street just north of the Conrail Tracks.  About 25 homes were heavily damaged, several collapsed.  Miraculously, only five persons were injured.  The last two tornado related injuries occurred in northern Rockland Township as it lifted and threw a modular home from its foundation.  The two men inside were injured.  The tornado then lifted.Although the tornado lifted, the parent thunderstorm still produced wind damage across eastern Berks County.   Noble Street was closed in Kutztown because of downed trees and lines.  Trees were also uprooted in Longswamp Township.  Downed limbs and wires caused power outages in District, Greenwich, Longswamp and Rockland Townships.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.4M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Seven persons were injured (five within Lyons).  About 40 homes were either destroyed or damaged in Lyons, Maiden Creek, Maxatawny and Richmond Townships.  Preliminary damage estimates for the entire event were placed at $1.5 million dollars. About 10,250 homes and businesses lost power.  The last homes to come back on line were in Lyons on June 3rd.  This was the first tornado of that strength to occur in Southeast Pennsylvania and the Southern Poconos since the Limerick Tornado on July 27, 1994 and the first F3 tornado to occur within Berks County since November 4, 1950. Even before the tornado formed, the parent thunderstorm was producing wind damage in western Berks County.  Wind damage started in Centre Township as several trailers were overturned in Donny Acres.  In Leesport, the severe thunderstorm ripped the entire roof off one home.  The couple in the house was temporarily trapped after the porch roof they use to access the stairs collapsed.  The thunderstorm also ripped the roof and some bricks off a detached garage.  Other houses and buildings on East Main Street also had some minor wind damage.

The episode was highlighted by supercell thunderstorms which produced three tornadoes, numerous instances of large hail, and several downbursts.The most substantial event was a strong-to-violent tornado which caused excessive damage in western Allegany Co.  The multi-vortex twister had estimated wind speeds of 210 mph - the highest in recorded Maryland history - when it ravaged a neighborhood of well-constructed single-family homes along a local plateau just north of Frostburg.  The tornado was on the ground for an amazing 33 miles, beginning in Somerset Co, Pennsylvania before crossing northeastern Garrett Co Maryland on its way to Allegany Co.  The parent supercell tracked over 200 miles.  After descending Big Savage Mountain, the twister produced a swath of destruction across a neighborhood just west of Frostburg.  At least eight homes were destroyed and dozens others were damaged.  Several cars were damaged, and some were totalled.  One two-story home was obliterated.  Left in the wake was the foundation and some remnant plywood.  The residents of the home - a woman and two children - received ample warning and rode out the storm to safety in the basement.  Advance warning likely saved several lives and reduced casualties; in all, only 5 area residents sustained minor injuries.The tornado continued through Eckhart Mines and Clarysville, causing further damage and destruction to homes and other property.  It then continued through undeveloped areas, then passed across Dans Mountain before damaging a few more residences along state route 53 just north of Cresaptown.  The twister lifted at that point, but the parent thunderstorm continued producing damage into eastern West Virginia.  In all, emergency management officials reported 29 homes destroyed and 125 damaged, with nearly half of the surviving homes receiving moderate to major levels of damage.  Initial dollar estimates ranged from $4.5 to $5 million.  Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of trees in forested and developed areas were snapped or uprooted.  The supercell was so powerful that Frostburg area residents' papers, including personal checks and one high school diploma - were found over 50 miles downstream in the northern Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia.The "Frostburg Tornado" was not the only twister to affect the county.  The area had been on high alert since early evening - tornado warnings had been issued two other times, and funnel clouds were observed by several witnesses prior to sunset.  One of the funnels touched down not too far from where the Frostburg Tornado entered the county - along the west side of Big Savage Mountain nearly 2 hours earlier.  The funnel lifted while over Frostburg and nearby communities, and continued through Cumberland before touching down again on Irons Mountain 2-3 miles southeast of the city.  In each instance, damage was limited to forested areas along the ridges.Tornadoes were just a portion of the severe weather to affect northern Maryland.  The other major player was hail, with dozens of occurrences associated with each mini-supercell.  The strongest cells produced hailstones ranging from 1.75" to 2.50" in diameter; the strong updrafts in each storm combined with steep atmospheric lapse rates to produce not only large hail but long-duration hail as well.  Some areas experienced up to 20 minutes of  hail, and many residents noted hail which covered the ground.  Reported damage included some stripped siding, varying sized dings and dents, as well as shattered glass,  in numerous vehicles; stripped paint from homes and vehicles, small limb and leaf debris, and likely crop damage or destruction.  The main hail-producing storm affected portions of northern Montgomery, Howard, southern Carroll, southern Baltimore, and northern Prince George's and Anne Arundel Cos - all between 1800 and 1945EST.The episode concluded in Maryland with a few wind damage reports on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay just before midnight.  Winds blew out the door to the Annapolis (Anne Arundel Co) city fire department station, and knocked several large trees down in Eastport at approximately the same time.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This set the stage for a major severe weather outbreak in eastern New York.  In this highly sheared environment several lines of severe thunderstorms formed ahead of an approaching cold front.  This resulted in three tornadoes and severe thunderstorm damage in every county.   The most significant tornado occurred in Saratoga County and northern Rensselaer County.  This tornado touched down at Ushers Road in the Town of Halfmoon and moved due east into the City of Mechanicville.  Here, the tornado intensified to an F3 and destroyed the DiSiena Furniture Company.  The tornado tracked over Viall Hill where several housing developments were devastated.  It continued east into the Riverside area in the Town of Stillwater, where many homes, businesses and several warehouses including De Crescente Distributing Company were destroyed or heavily damaged.  The tornado then crossed the Hudson River into Rensselaer County and decreased to an F2.  The tornado tracked across the Town of Schaghticoke and just brushed the Village of Schaghticoke to the north.  Czub Grain Farm on Verbeck Avenue was heavily damaged.  It then followed the Hoosic River as it crossed the Village of Valley Falls and into the northern portion of the Town of Pittstown to Millertown.  At this point the track became discontinuous and the intensity decreased to an F1.  In the Town of Hoosick the path became continuous again and increased to an F2.  Several farms received extensive damage including Lukeland Dairy Farm where a 60 ton silo and barn were leveled.  The tornado then tracked from extreme northeast Rensselaer County to Bennington County in southern Vermont where it quickly decreased to an F1 after crossing the border.  Governor Pataki declared a State of Emergency in Saratoga and Rensselaer Counties.  The National Guard was called in by the Governor to assist in the clean up.  In Saratoga County approximately 55 homes were destroyed and 230 were damaged.  In Rensselaer County approximately 50 to 60 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.  Power was not restored to parts of this region for three to four days.  Approximately 70 injuries occurred with this tornado but no one was killed.  Another tornado tracked across southern Rensselaer County.  This tornado first touched down on Palmer Road about two miles east of Interstate 90 in the Town of Schodack.  The tornado moved due east and passed just south of North Schodack then tracked east northeast to Millers Corners on the south shore of Burden Lake.  The damage path continued in this direction to Pike Pond before it dissipated at Alps Mountain.  This tornado destroyed three barns, damaged several homes and produced extensive tree damage along its path.  The last tornado tracked across the Albany International Airport.  It began southwest of the airport about one-half mile west of Memory Gardens Cemetery.  The damage path continued east northeast to the Albany ASOS unit where an 82 mile an hour gust was reported.  Next it tracked near the Air National Guard facility at the Albany Airport before it crossed Interstate 87 and dissipated.  The most widespread damage occurred near the Hilton Hotel where several trees were uprooted or sheared off.   At Easton in Washington County, a microburst producing winds of 100 miles an hour took the roof off the fire house and leveled a barn after it was carried 60 yards.  South of the Village of Herkimer in Herkimer County, a powerful downburst took the roof off a T hangar at a small private airport and damaged two airplanes.  A couple of out buildings and a small trailer office were also rolled off their foundations.  The severe weather caused widespread power outages across all of eastern New York.  The damaging winds downed power lines, power poles and trees in many locations.  Structural damage occurred to several homes and garages due to downed trees.  Damage to crops was also quite extensive especially in the mid Hudson Valley and Capital District.  Resources from the State Department of Agriculture and Markets were made available to many counties in this region.  Approximately 25 cows were killed across the area due to either electrocution or collapsed barns.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 60M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This set the stage for a major severe weather outbreak in eastern New York.  In this highly sheared environment several lines of severe thunderstorms formed ahead of an approaching cold front.  This resulted in three tornadoes and severe thunderstorm damage in every county.   The most significant tornado occurred in Saratoga County and northern Rensselaer County.  This tornado touched down at Ushers Road in the Town of Halfmoon and moved due east into the City of Mechanicville.  Here, the tornado intensified to an F3 and destroyed the DiSiena Furniture Company.  The tornado tracked over Viall Hill where several housing developments were devastated.  It continued east into the Riverside area in the Town of Stillwater, where many homes, businesses and several warehouses including De Crescente Distributing Company were destroyed or heavily damaged.  The tornado then crossed the Hudson River into Rensselaer County and decreased to an F2.  The tornado tracked across the Town of Schaghticoke and just brushed the Village of Schaghticoke to the north.  Czub Grain Farm on Verbeck Avenue was heavily damaged.  It then followed the Hoosic River as it crossed the Village of Valley Falls and into the northern portion of the Town of Pittstown to Millertown.  At this point the track became discontinuous and the intensity decreased to an F1.  In the Town of Hoosick the path became continuous again and increased to an F2.  Several farms received extensive damage including Lukeland Dairy Farm where a 60 ton silo and barn were leveled.  The tornado then tracked from extreme northeast Rensselaer County to Bennington County in southern Vermont where it quickly decreased to an F1 after crossing the border.  Governor Pataki declared a State of Emergency in Saratoga and Rensselaer Counties.  The National Guard was called in by the Governor to assist in the clean up.  In Saratoga County approximately 55 homes were destroyed and 230 were damaged.  In Rensselaer County approximately 50 to 60 homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed.  Power was not restored to parts of this region for three to four days.  Approximately 70 injuries occurred with this tornado but no one was killed.  Another tornado tracked across southern Rensselaer County.  This tornado first touched down on Palmer Road about two miles east of Interstate 90 in the Town of Schodack.  The tornado moved due east and passed just south of North Schodack then tracked east northeast to Millers Corners on the south shore of Burden Lake.  The damage path continued in this direction to Pike Pond before it dissipated at Alps Mountain.  This tornado destroyed three barns, damaged several homes and produced extensive tree damage along its path.  The last tornado tracked across the Albany International Airport.  It began southwest of the airport about one-half mile west of Memory Gardens Cemetery.  The damage path continued east northeast to the Albany ASOS unit where an 82 mile an hour gust was reported.  Next it tracked near the Air National Guard facility at the Albany Airport before it crossed Interstate 87 and dissipated.  The most widespread damage occurred near the Hilton Hotel where several trees were uprooted or sheared off.   At Easton in Washington County, a microburst producing winds of 100 miles an hour took the roof off the fire house and leveled a barn after it was carried 60 yards.  South of the Village of Herkimer in Herkimer County, a powerful downburst took the roof off a T hangar at a small private airport and damaged two airplanes.  A couple of out buildings and a small trailer office were also rolled off their foundations.  The severe weather caused widespread power outages across all of eastern New York.  The damaging winds downed power lines, power poles and trees in many locations.  Structural damage occurred to several homes and garages due to downed trees.  Damage to crops was also quite extensive especially in the mid Hudson Valley and Capital District.  Resources from the State Department of Agriculture and Markets were made available to many counties in this region.  Approximately 25 cows were killed across the area due to either electrocution or collapsed barns.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 60M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first tornado developed near Pine Hall in Stokes County around 314 PM EST and traveled northeast about 1.5 miles before dissipating around 317 PM EST. This small F1 tornado broke out windows, lifted a car off the ground, tore the roof off a house, damaged several mobile homes and toppled trees. The second tornado developed one mile southwest of Mayodan around 325 PM EST and traveled to the northeast about 12 miles before dissipating about three miles northwest of Eden around 349 PM EST. This rather large F3 tornado damaged or destroyed 500 to 600 residences and damaged or destroyed nearly all businesses in Stoneville and some businesses in Mayodan. This tornado tossed a truck 60 feet, carried a cinder block and an empty boat trailer about a quarter mile and pushed a 25,000 pound fire truck about 60 feet. The tornado knocked out a 300 foot section of a wall and severely damaged the roof from a large building in Mayodan. Damage to this building was estimated at 25 million dollars. The tornado was generally 100 to 400 yards wide, but in one place was around 800 yards wide. Two people lost their lives and officially 27 were injured. The fatalities included an 80 year old man who was pulled from his house southwest of Stoneville and tossed 500 feet in the air and a 24 year old woman who was in her car in Stoneville when the tornado hit. The tornado tossed her car into a building and then the wall of the building collapsed on the car. There were likely another 10 to 20 injuries that were unreported as people drove themselves to the hospital or were driven by friends. Cancelled checks and papers from Stoneville were found 53 miles north-northeast in Huddleston, Virginia. In addition, material from Mayodan and Stoneville were found at several locations around Martinsville, Virginia.After the tornado lifted three miles northwest of Eden, non-tornadic wind damage continued to the Virginia State line. Thunderstorm winds knocked down trees, damaged outbuildings and barns and tore shingles from some roofs.

The damage path was surveyed by a NWS employee who reported damage at the Whispering Pines mobile home park.

Ground survey indicated that the tornado moved northeast across Lake-In-The-Water Road and caused sporadic minor damage to the roofs of a few homes and downed trees and branches in the Oakwood Drive subdivision.  The tornado continued northeast, widened to 250 yards and intensified to F2 strength where it destroyed or severely damaged several structures along Doherty Drive.Two mobile homes that took a direct hit from the F2 tornado along Doherty Drive were completely disintegrated with only frame rails and tie downs intact.  Meanwhile, in close proximity to the crushed mobile homes, a well-built home, with rebar-poured concrete, reinforced cinder block walls and a hip roof, suffered minor structural and roofing tile damage after taking a direct hit by the F2 tornado on Doherty Drive.  A pick-up truck parked adjacent to the well-built home was pushed 30 feet from its original resting place by the tornadic wind.Residents along Doherty Drive reported the sound of the tornado resembled that of a large freight train.  One severely injured resident on Doherty Drive was tossed over 50 feet into the street from his mobile home that was destroyed by the tornado.A storage facility with unsupported cinder block walls and a high unsupported roof span was demolished by the tornadic wind.  Tornado ground survey indicated that a large ten foot plus wide wood door entrance failed and allowed the tornadic wind to enter the commercial structure and exert extreme pressure on the outer load bearing walls which collapsed outward.Aerial survey indicated that the tornado weakened to F1 strength and continued northeast across rural pasture and semi-wooded swampland where it caused severe damage to a few mobile homes, barns, fences and sheds before it crossed State Road 60, one quarter mile west of Tiger Lake Road, or 11.5 miles east of Lake Wales.The tornado downed large power lines along State Road 60 and continued northeast where it snapped tree tops and branches before it lifted and dissipated along the southwest shore of Lake Kissimmee.The tornado in all destroyed or severely damaged twelve homes, caused moderate to slight damage to an additional fourteen homes, severely damaged four commercial buildings and damaged two recreational vehicles.  The tornado also snapped several large power poles, downed numerous power lines and uprooted or snapped several large trees.  Tornado damage to structures was estimated at one million dollars while damage to the electrical infrastructure was estimated at one million dollars.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It produced numerous tornadoes.  When it moved into our county warning area, it produced two tornadoes over Clay County.  The first tornado touched down 3 miles west southwest of Flora.  As it travelled to the northeast it destroyed a set of crossing signals along a set of railroad tracks.  It moved parallel to the tracks and on the west edge of Flora it blew 60 to 70 cars of a moving CSX freight train off the tracks.  No injuries were reported with the train crew or anyone nearby.  At this point the tornado was F2 intensity.  Most of the tornado track through Flora stayed south of the railroad tracks.  In this area most of the structural damage to frame houses was relatively minor with roof/siding damage the most common.  A few homes totally lost roofs, garages/storage sheds were destroyed, and one unanchored mobile home was destroyed and landed about 100 feet from its foundation.  Three occupants sustained minor injuries.  Several vehicles in the area were damaged from falling trees and debris.  The tornado briefly lifted and came down again on the east side of town.  It damaged or destroyed 40 to 50 condominiums, which was due more to a result of poor construction techniques rather than wind speed.  Roof structures did not survive, with the rafters only consisting of 2x4s.  The tornado was rated F1 in this area.  After hitting the condominium complex, the tornado caused light damage to an industrial park with power poles down and 10 businesses sustaining damage.  From there the damage was light, mainly to trees.  Two miles northwest of Clay City, the tornado overturned a mobile home before lifting.  At about the same time, half a mile to the north of the first tornado, another tornado formed and touched down.  It destroyed a mobile home (F2 intensity) and then travelled to the northeast causing spotty damage, mainly to trees.  It destroyed a shed 5 miles north of Olney (Richland County) before lifting and dissipating.  In total 8 people sustained minor injuries.  Damage in Clay County was estimated around $2.2 million and no damage estimate was available for Richland County.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It remained on the ground for about half a mile and its path width was about 100 yards.  One construction worker suffered minor injuries when some debris was thrown into his face as he was diving under a guardrail.  No other injuries were reported.  Property damage including damage to the Coventry Mall was estimated at $25,000.  About eight homes, mainly on the south side of Pearl Place suffered minor damage.

The tornado moved between Pearl Place to its north and Pennsylvania State Route 724 to its south and lifted just before it reached Kline Avenue.  The tornado passed just to the north of the North Coventry Elementary School.  At the mall, the tornado pulled open several doors and took two clothing racks from a J.C. Penney Store.  It knocked down several poles, damaged a 10 foot by 25 foot privacy wall, blew a large trash container through a concrete retaining wall and uprooted eight trees.  The tornado also damaged the roof of a Pizza Hut Restaurant,  snapped two steel power line towers and cracked seven other utility poles on Pennsylvania State Route 724.  As the tornado crossed Pennsylvania State Route 100, it hurled construction debris and street signs and injured one worker.  An exit sign was found half a mile away.  It then cut a path behind the homes on the south side of Pearl Place.  About 40 trees were damaged in the area.  One home had numerous shingles pulled from it, another had a tree leaning on it and a third had a shed destroyed.  About five other homes also suffered minor damage.

The most damage was from large hail hitting the urban areas, especially the Kanawha City section of Charleston.   Hundreds of vehicles were dented, including new cars at dealerships.  Roofs, plus west facing siding and windows were also damaged.   Large trees were also uprooted or snapped.  The largest concentration of tree damage was from the South Hills and Kanawha City sections of Charleston on east,  to Malden.   So the wind damage was still substantial.  One large tree damaged a church, another tree heavily damaged a home along Lower Donnally Road.   The largest insurance company reported a total of about 10,000 claims  for homes and vehicles combined.One Kanawha City business owner said, "I never saw anything like this before.  I never thought I'd go through this in West Virginia."   The junior high school in Kanawha City was to be letting students go home just before the storm hit.  Instead, the staff and students took shelter in the interior hallways of the school.    The warnings and the smart action by citizens of the Kanawha Valley prevented any injuries from this powerful thunderstorm.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Large trees were uprooted along Mount Union Ridge, mainly south of County Route 37.

The most damage was from large hail hitting the urban areas, especially the Kanawha City section of Charleston.   Hundreds of vehicles were dented, including new cars at dealerships.  Roofs, plus west facing siding and windows were also damaged.   Large trees were also uprooted or snapped.  The largest concentration of tree damage was from the South Hills and Kanawha City sections of Charleston on east,  to Malden.   So the wind damage was still substantial.  One large tree damaged a church, another tree heavily damaged a home along Lower Donnally Road.   The largest insurance company reported a total of about 10,000 claims  for homes and vehicles combined.One Kanawha City business owner said, "I never saw anything like this before.  I never thought I'd go through this in West Virginia."   The junior high school in Kanawha City was to be letting students go home just before the storm hit.  Instead, the staff and students took shelter in the interior hallways of the school.    The warnings and the smart action by citizens of the Kanawha Valley prevented any injuries from this powerful thunderstorm.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Large trees were uprooted along Mount Union Ridge, mainly south of County Route 37.  One mobile home was destroyed.  One man was injured when a large tree hit his van, trapping him inside.  The tornado crossed into Putnam County.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 75K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The F1 damage was limited to a small area near Lackland Road and Lindbergh Boulevard. The Carol House Furniture store suffered the most damage, losing part of a wall and the roof. Two nearby automobile dealerships had about 200 cars damaged. One school had roof damage and windows broken. The one injury occurred when a century-old oak tree crashed into the kitchen where a man was sitting. He was treated for head and leg injuries.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

These long-lived, cyclic supercells produced a considerable amount of large hail and some damaging winds in the mountains. The first tornado of the day in western North Carolina occurred in Madison county. Numerous reports of hail as large as golf balls were reported from the mountains. In Madison and Yancey counties, hail covered roads. More supercell thunderstorms developed behind the previous ones and followed similar tracks. In northern Buncombe county, the town of Barnardsville had three separate severe storms cross overhead and drop hail on the ground to a depth of 3 inches. Yancey county also had 3 separate storms move across the county that accumulated hail to 6 inches in depth. The hail was still on the ground the next morning. As the supercells moved into the foothills, they began to curve a little to the right, indicative of strong mesocyclonic circulations present. One supercell produced several tornadoes from Alexander county to Davie county. Another storm produced a tornado that tracked from western Caldwell county into south-central Alexander county. A third supercell that emerged out of the mountains in McDowell county produced several tornadoes from the southern part of that county to northern Mecklenburg county. Damage was fairly significant across western North Carolina with numerous homes either damaged or destroyed. Fortunately, no one was killed. However, 2 people were injured as a result of the violent F4 tornado in eastern Caldwell county.

The combustible situation produced a mesoscale low pressure system which focused the most substantial severe which focused the most substantial severe weather in north-central Maryland.   The episode featured five tornadoes, nearly a dozen instances of wind damage, and several large hail occurrences.The most concentrated damage was in and around Hagerstown.  Three separate tornadoes dropped from the same parent thunderstorm within moments of each other.  The first two caused considerable property damage between the town of Halfway and Hagerstown.  The third produced a track of mainly tree and underbrush damage from just south of the Washington County Regional Airport to the Maryland/Pennsylvania state line.  The first twister, which developed three miles south of Halfway, toppled and uprooted dozens of trees and blew down wires in the Tammany Manor neighborhood, as well as at the Hickory Elementary School.  The tornado saved its worst for the Valley Mall, where a portion of the roof was torn off and damage was noted at an anchor store's loading dock.  Another adjacent store had an electrical fire.More commercial damage occurred a few blocks north, along Wesel Boulevard, where the roofs of several vacant buildings were torn off.  Canopy tents at the Wal-Mart department store were flattened; the store's garden center had its greenhouse destroyed; many pieces of equipment, and plants and flowers, were also damaged.  An awning at a local automobile dealership was ripped off.  This tornado dissipated just southeast of the Washington Co. Detention Center - but not before knocking down trees along Interstate 81, temporarily closing one of the two travel lanes.Shortly before the first tornado lifted, a second touched down in the Greenbury Hills subdivision of Halfway, uprooting trees and ripping siding from a few homes.  This twister, on the ground for five miles, caused much of its damage over the western portion of Hagerstown before dissipating.  At the Potomac Center, 44 trees were uprooted, and another 40 were damaged.  Dozens more were snapped and uprooted at the nearby Carroll Heights/Hyde Park subdivision; trees were also uprooted and snapped at the Rest Haven Cemetery, with at least four fallen trees knocking over headstones.  Hundreds more trees were damaged at both the Hagerstown Business College and the nearby Fountain Head Country Club, whose golf course was closed for two days to clean up the debris.While eastern Washington Co was being pummelled, another cell was producing wind damage from southwestern through central Frederick Co.  Several trees were snapped and uprooted, and some homes sustained damage to shingles, siding, and porch supports, in Middletown.  More damage was noted between Jefferson and Buckeystown - another microburst - witnessed by residents as a rolling black cloud.  Damage included numerous trees snapped and uprooted, a destroyed cinder block outbuilding, and a damaged garage door.  Farther to the northeast, more trees were snapped, including one which fell onto a house near Libertytown.  A small tornado touched down just northeast of Frederick city, taking down about a half-dozen trees near the intersection of Gas House and Linganore Roads.  Intense lightning caused problems as well.  The radio transmission tower which serves the Frederick Co emergency operations center was knocked out, with damage reported to radio and telecommunications equipment.  Several homes were struck in the area, as was a fire department vehicle.Severe weather propagated eastward into Carroll and Baltimore Cos.  Damaging winds snapped and uprooted many trees in Westminster, including one which fell onto a home.  Two trees crashed through residents' roofs along state route 31 near Westminster.  Large hail the size of tennis balls caused scattered damage to homes and vehicles in Finksburg.  The heavy rains associated with the stronger cells caused flash flooding across portions of the Big Pipe Creek watershed in northern Carroll Co; several roads were temporarily closed near Taneytown where the Bear Branch overflowed its banks.  One road was washed out.  Lightning struck at least one home and barn, causing small fires and minor damage.Just west of the Baltimore/Carroll line (1 mile southwest of Fowblesburg), a small tornado knocked down several trees, some which fell onto a house, a camper, and a shed.  Sheet metal was stripped from the shed; the trees were severely twisted, according to the resident.  More trees or large limbs fell in Reisterstown (Baltimore Co) and in northern Howard Co.As events were winding down across northern Maryland, another severe storm moved out of east-central Virginia and into lower southern Maryland, causing damage in counties that had been struck the previous evening.  Trees and large limbs fell across portions of northern and eastern Charles Co, but the storm apparently saved its worst for St Mary's Co, where three barns were destroyed and numerous trees were snapped or uprooted along the state route(s) 239/520 corridor near Milestown.  In Calvert Co, more trees/large limbs fell, and a portion of roof and some siding were stripped from one home.Thousands of Maryland residents lost power yet again due to the storms; a total of at least 25,000 customers in the Baltimore Gas and Electric and Allegheny Power service areas had no electricity during the height of the storm.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 200K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Large hail, damaging thunderstorm winds and two tornadic thunderstorms caused millions of dollars in damage.The first tornadic thunderstorm occurred in northern Gosper county just outside of the town of Elwood.  The tornado sat down to the southwest of Elwood then travelled east.  After a mile, the tornado turned and travelled due north.  It hit one farmstead, heavily damaging the home and totally destroying several outbuildings.  The path of the tornado when right down the middle of US highway 283.  A truck driver and a family of three were travelling north of Elwood when they realized the tornado was heading toward them.  They abandon their vehicles and sought cover in a ditch.  The tornado passed nearly overhead but the four survived with only minor injuries.  The one car was totalled and the semi-truck, loaded with ice cream, was heavily damaged.  The cargo was a total loss.  This same severe thunderstorm marched northeast and dropped another brief tornado just southeast of Odessa but no significant damage was reported.Another severe thunderstorm, which began in Smith county, Kansas, moved just north of the stateline and produced at least two confirmed touchdowns.  One was reported two miles north of Bostwick but did little damage.  Another tornado passed just to the southeast of Chester and damaged a farmstead.  The tornado sat down about a mile east of town then travelled southeast.  Damage at the farm was mainly confined to a couple of outbuildings.  The people in the farm house were not injured.  At least 25 center irrigation pivots were lost to the storm.  Damaging baseball sized hail was noted in Nelson and near Red Cloud.  Hail to the size of soft balls was reported eight miles southeast of Red Cloud.  In Clay county, residents were nailed twice with strong winds and hail during the evening.  The first occurred near 6 pm as 60 to 80 mph winds roared across the county.  The winds were likely outflow from the severe thunderstorm just to the south of the area.  At least two farmsteads had out building damage and tree damage was significant.  About three hours later, a different severe thunderstorm dumped golf ball sized hail while producing 60+ mph winds in central Clay county.  Many vehicles in Clay Center were damaged and 25 windows were shattered in the Courthouse.  Corn and soybean loss totalled over two million dollars as some crops were levelled by the wind and hail.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first tornado developed near Pine Hall in Stokes County around 314 PM EST and traveled northeast about 1.5 miles before dissipating around 317 PM EST. This small F1 tornado broke out windows, lifted a car off the ground, tore the roof off a house, damaged several mobile homes and toppled trees. The second tornado developed one mile southwest of Mayodan around 325 PM EST and traveled to the northeast about 12 miles before dissipating about three miles northwest of Eden around 349 PM EST. This rather large F3 tornado damaged or destroyed 500 to 600 residences and damaged or destroyed nearly all businesses in Stoneville and some businesses in Mayodan. This tornado tossed a truck 60 feet, carried a cinder block and an empty boat trailer about a quarter mile and pushed a 25,000 pound fire truck about 60 feet. The tornado knocked out a 300 foot section of a wall and severely damaged the roof from a large building in Mayodan. Damage to this building was estimated at 25 million dollars. The tornado was generally 100 to 400 yards wide, but in one place was around 800 yards wide. Two people lost their lives and officially 27 were injured. The fatalities included an 80 year old man who was pulled from his house southwest of Stoneville and tossed 500 feet in the air and a 24 year old woman who was in her car in Stoneville when the tornado hit. The tornado tossed her car into a building and then the wall of the building collapsed on the car. There were likely another 10 to 20 injuries that were unreported as people drove themselves to the hospital or were driven by friends. Cancelled checks and papers from Stoneville were found 53 miles north-northeast in Huddleston, Virginia. In addition, material from Mayodan and Stoneville were found at several locations around Martinsville, Virginia.After the tornado lifted three miles northwest of Eden, non-tornadic wind damage continued to the Virginia State line. Thunderstorm winds knocked down trees, damaged outbuildings and barns and tore shingles from some roofs.

The most significant storm developed in Washita county at approximately 400 pm CST and intensified as it moved east toward central Oklahoma.  This storm produced at least six tornadoes as it tracked from Canadian County across Oklahoma County during the early evening. The most damaging tornado (an F2)  touched down in northeast Oklahoma City and crossed Interstate 35 near the Frontier City theme park. Other tornadoes damaged the Oklahoma City Boat Club, portions of The Village and Nichols Hills, the Highland Park neighborhood west of Broadway Extension, and the area near May and Grand Avenues in Oklahoma City. Three weak tornadoes also touched down in open country northwest of El Reno and near Yukon. In addition to damaging tornadoes, the storm produced extensive straight-line wind damage from Lake Hefner, across Nichols Hills and The Village, into northeast Oklahoma County. Winds likely exceeded 100 mph in some areas. There were no fatalities and only 21 relatively minor injuries reported in Oklahoma County. The majority of the injuries were sustained at the Frontier City theme park. Earlier, another supercell thunderstorm produced tornadoes near Longdale in Blaine County and 3 miles southwest of Guthrie.  Supercells that tracked across Noble County and northern Cleveland County produced large hail and severe winds, but no tornadoes.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado was the most intense of the day. The tornado touched down approximately 1/4 mile southwest of the corner of Bryant Avenue and Hefner Road, and moved northeast crossing Interstate 35 at the Frontier City theme park parking lot. The tornado continued northeast along northeast 122nd Street and eventually dissipated 1/4 mile northeast of Interstate 44 at Douglas Blvd. The total path length was approximately 5 1/2 miles. Maximum width was 200 yards east of Interstate 35 and south of Interstate 44. The tornado was rated F2 (At 122nd Street approximately 1-2 miles east of I-35). Seventeen minor injuries (3 transported to hospital) occurred at Frontier City. Along the track, major structural damage occurred to businesses along Interstate 35 from 122nd Street southward for approximately three-quarters of a mile. The Frontier City theme park was among the hardest hit businesses. The tornado passed through the parking lot damaging numerous vehicles before striking a two-story concrete block building at the northeast corner of the park. This building suffered partial failure of external walls and the entire roof was removed. Damage to adjacent areas of the park was mainly due to strong inflow into the tornado.On the east side of Interstate 35, a Texaco truck stop was severely damaged. Empty semi-tractor trailers located in the east parking lot of the truck stop were over turned and rolled tens of feet. One trailer was briefly airborne and landed on another empty trailer. A small portable building containing a CB radio shop in the parking area was completely swept away into a grove of trees east of the lot. Numerous homes suffered major damage to roofs, windows, and garage doors in the Nottingham and Quail Ridge Run subdivisions located along 122nd Street 1-2 miles east of I35. Several homes suffered major or nearly complete roof failure, though most exterior walls remained intact. These homes were of recent construction and were well built with brick exterior facades (some likely in excess of $200K). No means of anchoring the roofs to the exterior walls was noted. The tornado may have approached F3 at times in these neighborhoods. The most severly damaged home was located atop a small hill with garage doors on the upwind side of the home. Debris patterns suggest the garage doors failed allowing the wind to lift the roof. Without the roof in place, failure of the external garage walls occurred. The most severe damage to trees occurred in these subdivisions and areas immediately adjacent.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The most significant storm developed in Washita county at approximately 400 pm CST and intensified as it moved east toward central Oklahoma.  This storm produced at least six tornadoes as it tracked from Canadian County across Oklahoma County during the early evening. The most damaging tornado (an F2)  touched down in northeast Oklahoma City and crossed Interstate 35 near the Frontier City theme park. Other tornadoes damaged the Oklahoma City Boat Club, portions of The Village and Nichols Hills, the Highland Park neighborhood west of Broadway Extension, and the area near May and Grand Avenues in Oklahoma City. Three weak tornadoes also touched down in open country northwest of El Reno and near Yukon. In addition to damaging tornadoes, the storm produced extensive straight-line wind damage from Lake Hefner, across Nichols Hills and The Village, into northeast Oklahoma County. Winds likely exceeded 100 mph in some areas. There were no fatalities and only 21 relatively minor injuries reported in Oklahoma County. The majority of the injuries were sustained at the Frontier City theme park. Earlier, another supercell thunderstorm produced tornadoes near Longdale in Blaine County and 3 miles southwest of Guthrie.  Supercells that tracked across Noble County and northern Cleveland County produced large hail and severe winds, but no tornadoes.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado was the most intense of the day.

After a period of erratic movement, Frances settled on a northwest track that brought it ashore in the early morning hours of September 11th between Port Aransas and Port Oconner, Texas.  Due to the large pressure difference between Tropical Storm Frances and a high pressure system over the eastern United States, a prolonged period of strong east and southeast winds that occasionally reached tropical storm force affected coastal sections of southeast Louisiana.  Peak wind gusts of 60 mph at 1029 CST on the 10th and 55 mph at 1826 PM on the 10th were recorded at the Burrwood and Grand Isle C-MAN stations, respectively.  A wind gust of 62 mph was observed at a buoy in eastern Lake Pontchartrain near the Rigolets during a squall at 1510 CST on the 11th.  Significant tidal flooding occurred during the event with tides averaging 2 to 4 feet above normal along the southeast Louisiana coastline and in Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas.  The persistent strong winds and resulting high tides pushed a considerable amount of water into the tidal lakes of southeast Louisiana parishes and well inland along marshes, bayous, and other low-lying areas.  This resulted in a number of  homes outside of the levee protection systems being flooded and caused the flooding of many roadways.  The most severe flooding occurred in Terrebonne, Lafourche, and lower Jefferson Parishes.  Many businesses along the Harvey Canal in Jefferson Parish were damaged due to storm surge flooding,  and the levee along the canal was nearly overtopped.  In addition, very heavy rainfall occurred with most locations of southeast Louisiana receiving a minimum of 5 inches during the storm with some areas south of Lake Pontchartrain receiving 15 to 30 inches of rain.  The heavy rainfall resulted in widespread flash flooding south of Lake Pontchartrain.The flash flooding peaked on September 11th when intense rainfall associated with a Tropical Storm Francis rainband resulted in rainfall amounts of 5 to 7 inches within a two to three hours period over portions of the greater New Orleans area.  By late afternoon, rainfall totals had reached from 8 to 12 inches.  Rainfall runoff overwhelmed drainage pumping capacity producing widespread and deep flooding in the streets of the New Orleans metropolitan area.  Ground transportation throughout much of Orleans Parish and portions of adjacent parishes was brought to a near standstill during the afternoon by the flooding, stranding many at work, school, or in autos.  The street flooding subsided during the evening. Around 800 homes and 30 businesses were flooded in Jefferson Parish from either storm surge flooding outside of the hurricane protection levees and flash flooding from heavy rainfall.  In Orleans Parish at least 290 single family homes and 124 apartments and businesses were flooded.  A tornado developed in an outer rainband associated with Tropical Storm Francis on the evening of September 10th and followed a path approximately 4 miles long from near Cut Off to Larose killing a 22 year old male in a mobile home.  The most severe damage occurred in the first one half to three quarters mile of the path.  Several mobile homes were destroyed, 3 conventional houses had roofs taken off, two houses were moved off their piling foundation, and two businesses suffered extensive damage.  The tornado was strongest near the beginning of the track where F2 damage occurred. Over the remainder of the track, F1 damage was reported.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> .5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Three people were killed, two in Barren county and one in Metcalfe, as the tornadoes moved through. A 78 year old man  was killed by fallen debris from his house in Wisdom accounting for the Metcalfe county death. In Glasgow of Barren county, a 67 year old man was killed in his mobile home and a 47 year old man was killed by flying debris off his greenhouse. The Glasgow area of Barren county and the Pellyton area of Adair county were hardest hit sustaining F3 damage. In Glasgow, 1 house was destroyed and 45 were badly damaged. 35 mobile homes and 25 barns were also badly damaged or destroyed. Winds were estimated at around 175 mph in the Glasgow area. Another wide area area of severe destruction took place across northern Adair county from around Portland to Pellyton. There, 14 houses were destroyed or received major damage. 3 mobile homes and 27 barns were also destroyed. 146 homes and 50 barns were damaged or destroyed across Barren county, while 30 homes, 84 barns, 2 schools and 8 businesses were damaged or destroyed across Adair county. Metcalfe county also sustained minimal damage to 19 structures, major damage to 43 and destruction to 54. F2 damage was estimated across much of Metcalfe county. Many eyewitnesses across the affected counties reported two smaller sub-vortices within the parent funnels. After reviewing Doppler radar reflectivity patterns and damage patterns, it appears the first tornado moved from northern Logan county to the Barren-Metcalfe county line. Then another formed in the near Wisdom in Metcalfe county before it dissipated 2 miles east of Edmonton. A final tornado from the parent supercell formed near Portland in Adair county and moved 20 miles to Pellyton before also dissipating.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Once the tornado moved east of GA State Road 17,  it lifted. There were no further reports of damage or touchdowns  from the parent supercell until the F1 touchdown reported just west of Hardeeville, S.C., which is approximately 12 miles from the last report of damage in Effingham County, Georgia. There were 40 homes damaged along GA 17, about  5 miles south of Guyton. Six of these were mobile homes that were destroyed. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped off 10 to 15 feet above the ground.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> .5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Three people were killed, two in Barren county and one in Metcalfe, as the tornadoes moved through. A 78 year old man  was killed by fallen debris from his house in Wisdom accounting for the Metcalfe county death. In Glasgow of Barren county, a 67 year old man was killed in his mobile home and a 47 year old man was killed by flying debris off his greenhouse. The Glasgow area of Barren county and the Pellyton area of Adair county were hardest hit sustaining F3 damage. In Glasgow, 1 house was destroyed and 45 were badly damaged. 35 mobile homes and 25 barns were also badly damaged or destroyed. Winds were estimated at around 175 mph in the Glasgow area. Another wide area area of severe destruction took place across northern Adair county from around Portland to Pellyton. There, 14 houses were destroyed or received major damage. 3 mobile homes and 27 barns were also destroyed. 146 homes and 50 barns were damaged or destroyed across Barren county, while 30 homes, 84 barns, 2 schools and 8 businesses were damaged or destroyed across Adair county. Metcalfe county also sustained minimal damage to 19 structures, major damage to 43 and destruction to 54. F2 damage was estimated across much of Metcalfe county. Many eyewitnesses across the affected counties reported two smaller sub-vortices within the parent funnels. After reviewing Doppler radar reflectivity patterns and damage patterns, it appears the first tornado moved from northern Logan county to the Barren-Metcalfe county line. Then another formed in the near Wisdom in Metcalfe county before it dissipated 2 miles east of Edmonton. A final tornado from the parent supercell formed near Portland in Adair county and moved 20 miles to Pellyton before also dissipating.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Many of these thunderstorms developed rotation with some storms ultimately producing tornadoes.  The first thunderstorms of the day developed over central Oklahoma and then moved eastward toward Okfuskee County after 430 PM CDT, traversing the counties along and just north of I-40 through 730 PM CDT before exiting into Arkansas to the east of Stilwell and Sallisaw.  These thunderstorms produced large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, and two brief tornado touchdowns in Muskogee County.  Other severe thunderstorms developed behind the first cluster, producing severe weather primarily in Creek and Okmulgee Counties from 700 PM to 830 PM CDT.Other severe thunderstorms developed rapidly around 600 PM CDT along a weak cold front across the northern border counties of Oklahoma.  These storms primarily produced large hail.  Further south in southeast Oklahoma, a cap of warm air in the mid-levels of the atmosphere prevented thunderstorm development until around 700 PM CDT with the approach of an upper level disturbance.  Once thunderstorms developed in Pittsburg County, they rapidly became severe and began rotating.  These storms moved east across Haskell and northern Le Flore Counties through 900 PM CDT, producing large hail, numerous reports of funnel clouds, several brief tornado touchdownsand a tornado producing considerable damage in the small town of Calhoun in northwestern Le Flore County.  At the time of the Calhoun tornado, the WSR-88D near Fort Smith had its first algorithm-induced tornado vortex signature (TVS).<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> At 838 PM CDT, a tornado touched down in the small community of Calhoun.

The tornado touched down at 330 PM one mile west of Charlotte Pike and I-440.  A tree fell on an ROTC student at Centennial Park. He was attending an ROTC picnic. He died later on May 4 from his injuries.  The tornado went through downtown Nashville at 340 PM and on toward East Nashville, Donelson and Hermitage. The tornado blew out many windows on office buildings. The Nations Bank Office Towers were one of the hardest hit buildings in Nashville.  Tennessee Performance Arts Center (TPAC) and the Tennessee Towers  sustained damage. TPAC had over 100 windows blown out. NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts from the Tennessee Towers and was off the air for about 24 hours. 30 private airplanes were damaged at Cornelia Fort Airport. Estimated damage to the airplanes was 3 million dollars.  35 buildings in downtown Nashville were "red tagged", meaning these buildings were structurally unsound.  Many signs in Davidson county were blown down or severely damaged. The tornado blew down 3 out of 10 construction cranes on the construction site of the Tennessee Oiler's Football Stadium near the Cumberland River. The tornado continued east and hit the residential section of East Nashville. At least 300 homes were damaged in East Nashville. Many homes lost a good part of their roofs, trees were uprooted, telephone poles were knocked down. St. Ann's  Episcopal Church, which is well over 100 years old, received major damage. Uprooted trees, damaged roofs to many homes was the story across Donelson and Hermitage. Numerous windows were blown out from the Gaylord Building in Donelson. About half the trees, that is over a thousand trees, were blown down at Andrew Jackson's home, The Hermitage. The Hermitage is a 600 acre estate of the former President. Some of those trees were well over 200 years old, and a few of those trees that were destroyed were planted by Andrew Jackson himself. Mayor Phil Bredesen closed downtown Nashville of Friday, April 17. Many workers had an unscheduled holiday. The downtown area was reopened Monday, April 20. This gave time for cleanup crews to remove broken glass and repair downed power lines.

The most significant storm developed in Washita county at approximately 400 pm CST and intensified as it moved east toward central Oklahoma.  This storm produced at least six tornadoes as it tracked from Canadian County across Oklahoma County during the early evening. The most damaging tornado (an F2)  touched down in northeast Oklahoma City and crossed Interstate 35 near the Frontier City theme park. Other tornadoes damaged the Oklahoma City Boat Club, portions of The Village and Nichols Hills, the Highland Park neighborhood west of Broadway Extension, and the area near May and Grand Avenues in Oklahoma City. Three weak tornadoes also touched down in open country northwest of El Reno and near Yukon. In addition to damaging tornadoes, the storm produced extensive straight-line wind damage from Lake Hefner, across Nichols Hills and The Village, into northeast Oklahoma County. Winds likely exceeded 100 mph in some areas. There were no fatalities and only 21 relatively minor injuries reported in Oklahoma County. The majority of the injuries were sustained at the Frontier City theme park. Earlier, another supercell thunderstorm produced tornadoes near Longdale in Blaine County and 3 miles southwest of Guthrie.  Supercells that tracked across Noble County and northern Cleveland County produced large hail and severe winds, but no tornadoes.See preceding individual Storm Data entries for further details and additional reports.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> This tornado touched down 1 block west of north May Avenue and Pembroke Terrace and moved east to Woods Park in Nichols Hills. Total path length was 1.5 miles and maximum width was 75 yards. This tornado was rated F2(113-157 mph). Four persons were injured and transported to local hospitals. Considerable damage was done to the strip mall in the 7400 block of north May Avenue. Windows were blown out of several businesses, several lost roofs, power lines were downed and large signs were bent.  One business on the east side of May Ave. suffered collapse of an exterior south facing wall. On Pembroke Terrace, an RV was thrown into a house, a car was over-turned, trees were toppled, and shingles and roof decking were partially blown away. Lesser damage occurred eastward into Nichols Hills. Interestingly, this tornado rotated anticyclonically. Although the over-turned car and major damage to one wood frame house roof suggested the tornado may have reached F2 intensity in a very small area, the majority of the damage was consistent with an F1 rating.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 150K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system dragged a warm front northeastward across central New York.  A southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for severe weather that afternoon and evening as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From early in the afternoon until the evening hours, central New York was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, six separate tornadoes touched down on this day in central New York.  The most devastating twister cut a discontinuous sixty plus mile track from southeastern Tioga county across southern Broome county and into Delaware county where it finally lifted back into the cloud base.  This tornado alone damaged or destroyed more than 30 homes and injured nearly 20 people.  Very fortunately, no fatalities occurred.  Another violent tornado ripped through southern sections of Otsego county between Laurens and Milford.  Thousands of trees were snapped off or uprooted with large sections of forest completely taken out.  Several residences were leveled and many roads were impassable for days due to the fallen debris.  The damage toll from this day's tornadoes ran into the millions.     Several strong bow echo complexes also affected central New York.  From southern Chenango county through the lower half of Otsego county, one such storm took out hundreds of trees and inflicted considerable structural damage in and around Oneonta.  One man was killed in Oneonta when hit by a falling tree limb.  Throughout Onondaga county, wind gusts estimated at 90 to 100 mph caused widespread damage early in the evening between 6:00 and 6:30 pm EDT.  Two large transmission towers near Nedrow were toppled from the winds and many buildings had blown out windows and/or roof damage.     Hail as large as 3 to 4 inches in diameter accompanied some of the tornadic supercells across New York's southern tier; smashing windows, severely denting cars, and causing crop losses.  New York State Electric and Gas Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power during the height of the storms late that afternoon and evening.  Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A supercell thunderstorm became tornadic as it crossed southern portions of the county around 6:30 pm EDT.  The storm cut nearly a 5 mile path from Laurens eastward into Milford township.       This twister incurred major damage to heavily forested areas.  Thousands of trees were laid out with the width of damage varying up to nearly a half mile in spots.  Trees were blown over in a chaotic and almost circular pattern as viewed from aerial damage surveys.  Several homes within the path of the twister also sustained heavy damage.  In the town of Laurens, a well built home was nearly destroyed with only the back and a portion of the side wall left in tact.  Many local roads were closed for up to 3 days as fallen trees made them completely impassable.  This included portions of routes 12 and 44.     The cell appeared to weaken as it approached Interstate 88 just east of Milford.       County emergency officials estimated damage totals in excess of three quarters of a million dollars from this twister.  Most of it stemmed from deforestation, repair of utility poles, and other repairs to homes and public structures.  Three minor injuries were sustained from falling tree limbs and flying debris.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 800K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system dragged a warm front across northeastern Pennsylvania.  Behind this front, a southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for the development of severe weather later that afternoon as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From late in the afternoon until late that evening, northeastern Pennsylvania was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, nine separate tornadoes touched down on this day.  Overall damage estimates run into the millions with many homes and structures heavily damaged or destroyed.  The most devastating storms occurred in Pike county.  Within about a 3 hour stretch from 7 to 10 pm EDT, four different twisters affected the county.  One tornadic cell was responsible for knocking down thousands of healthy large trees in and around Promised Land State Park with several vacation homes damaged or leveled.  Fortunately, injuries were kept at a minimum.       Widespread straight line wind damage also occurred with hailstones the size of ping pong balls falling in some places.  The north side of Scranton had extensive wind damage as a storm passed through shortly before 10 pm EDT and sections of Wayne and Luzerne counties had roads closed and/or blocked from falling trees for more than 2 days after the storm.  Pennsylvania Power and Light Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power at the height of the storms on the evening of the 31st.  Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The cell that produced tornadic damage earlier both in southern Wayne county and just upstream in Promised Land State Park dropped a tornado once again across the southern and southeastern portions of Pike county.  A nearly continuous 20 mile path was uncovered via aerial storm surveys from Pecks Pond east-southeastward to near route 739 in Delaware township.  The average width of the damage path was about 200 yards.     The twister descended once again in the Pecks Pond area around 8:20 pm EDT.  At that point, the intensity was rated as F2 as the tornado cut down nearly every tree in its path on its way towards Blue Heron Lake.  At approximately 8:30 pm, the tornado struck the small vacation community surrounding Blue Heron Lake.  A summer home was leveled by the force of the twister.  The only things left standing were an interior wall and a few sturdy metal cabinets on the floor in the kitchen.  An adjacent mobile home was severely damaged as well.  Two campers near this area had minor injuries from falling tree limbs.  Otherwise, though, injuries were kept to a minimum as homes were mostly vacant.  In addition, an estimated thousands of trees were sheared off or toppled bordering Blue Heron Lake both to the west and east.  The twister's intensity increased at this point to F3.  Further downstream, the tornado continued to cut a consistent path of twisted off and/or uprooted trees across the Little Mud Pond, Silver Lake, and Deer Leap Factory areas.  The tornado appeared to skip across hilltop sections along this route with its intensity mainly in the F1 range.  Finally, just before 8:45 pm EDT, the tornado ascended once again in Delaware township as little in the way of damage was evident between route 739 and the Delaware River.     In all, emergency management and federal officials estimated that in excess of 1 million dollars damage was incurred along this approximately 20 mile path.  Many roads were closed as they became impassable due to fallen trees and wires.  Portions of routes 402 and 390 were closed for several days.  In addition, sections of Promised Land State Park were closed off to the public for about two weeks until all debris was cleared away and power was restored.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system dragged a warm front across northeastern Pennsylvania.  Behind this front, a southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for the development of severe weather later that afternoon as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From late in the afternoon until late that evening, northeastern Pennsylvania was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, nine separate tornadoes touched down on this day.  Overall damage estimates run into the millions with many homes and structures heavily damaged or destroyed.  The most devastating storms occurred in Pike county.  Within about a 3 hour stretch from 7 to 10 pm EDT, four different twisters affected the county.  One tornadic cell was responsible for knocking down thousands of healthy large trees in and around Promised Land State Park with several vacation homes damaged or leveled.  Fortunately, injuries were kept at a minimum.       Widespread straight line wind damage also occurred with hailstones the size of ping pong balls falling in some places.  The north side of Scranton had extensive wind damage as a storm passed through shortly before 10 pm EDT and sections of Wayne and Luzerne counties had roads closed and/or blocked from falling trees for more than 2 days after the storm.  Pennsylvania Power and Light Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power at the height of the storms on the evening of the 31st.  Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The cell that produced tornadic damage earlier both in southern Wayne county and just upstream in Promised Land State Park dropped a tornado once again across the southern and southeastern portions of Pike county.  A nearly continuous 20 mile path was uncovered via aerial storm surveys from Pecks Pond east-southeastward to near route 739 in Delaware township.  The average width of the damage path was about 200 yards.     The twister descended once again in the Pecks Pond area around 8:20 pm EDT.  At that point, the intensity was rated as F2 as the tornado cut down nearly every tree in its path on its way towards Blue Heron Lake.  At approximately 8:30 pm, the tornado struck the small vacation community surrounding Blue Heron Lake.  A summer home was leveled by the force of the twister.  The only things left standing were an interior wall and a few sturdy metal cabinets on the floor in the kitchen.  An adjacent mobile home was severely damaged as well.  Two campers near this area had minor injuries from falling tree limbs.  Otherwise, though, injuries were kept to a minimum as homes were mostly vacant.  In addition, an estimated thousands of trees were sheared off or toppled bordering Blue Heron Lake both to the west and east.  The twister's intensity increased at this point to F3.  Further downstream, the tornado continued to cut a consistent path of twisted off and/or uprooted trees across the Little Mud Pond, Silver Lake, and Deer Leap Factory areas.  The tornado appeared to skip across hilltop sections along this route with its intensity mainly in the F1 range.  Finally, just before 8:45 pm EDT, the tornado ascended once again in Delaware township as little in the way of damage was evident between route 739 and the Delaware River.     In all, emergency management and federal officials estimated that in excess of 1 million dollars damage was incurred along this approximately 20 mile path.  Many roads were closed as they became impassable due to fallen trees and wires.  Portions of routes 402 and 390 were closed for several days.  In addition, sections of Promised Land State Park were closed off to the public for about two weeks until all debris was cleared away and power was restored.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first two storms developed quickly over central Wisconsin and then tracked east-southeast through the Fox Cities. These two storms primarily produced large hail (1 to 2 inches in diameter) and some wind damage. A brief tornado touched down with the first storm near Menasha (Winnebago co.).  The third storm developed farther north in the northeast part of the state. This storm evolved more slowly, but went through the classic life-cycle of a tornadic supercell and spawned an F3 tornado in Door county.Large hail struck the Fox Cities, especially Appleton, producing over $5 million in damage to vehicles and roofs of buildings.  This was the second multi-million dollar hailstorm this year in Appleton.  In Sherwood (Calumet co.), hail damage to a golf course was so severe that it did not open until two days later.  In Brillion (Calumet co.), hail shattered large glass panels of a church.The most severe damage occurred when a tornado tore a path 5.1 miles long and over a half-mile wide across Door county.  The tornado came onshore from Green Bay at Murphy Park, on the Door county west coast at 630 pm.  Thousands of trees were flattened in the heavily wooded area.  About 30 homes, businesses and barns were destroyed or heavily damaged by the storm, but only two minor injuries were reported.  Some livestock, however, including five horses, were lost.  The tornado knocked down seven power poles holding electrical transmission lines, bringing blackouts to most of the north half of Door county.  Thirty adults and 17 children at a campground found refuge in a concrete building as the tornado approached the grounds.  Two minor injuries occurred at the camping resort as it took a direct hit.  The twister made it almost two-thirds of the way across the county, before dissipating about 3 miles west of the Door county east coast.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.74M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The first two storms developed quickly over central Wisconsin and then tracked east-southeast through the Fox Cities. These two storms primarily produced large hail (1 to 2 inches in diameter) and some wind damage. A brief tornado touched down with the first storm near Menasha (Winnebago co.).  The third storm developed farther north in the northeast part of the state. This storm evolved more slowly, but went through the classic life-cycle of a tornadic supercell and spawned an F3 tornado in Door county.Large hail struck the Fox Cities, especially Appleton, producing over $5 million in damage to vehicles and roofs of buildings.  This was the second multi-million dollar hailstorm this year in Appleton.  In Sherwood (Calumet co.), hail damage to a golf course was so severe that it did not open until two days later.  In Brillion (Calumet co.), hail shattered large glass panels of a church.The most severe damage occurred when a tornado tore a path 5.1 miles long and over a half-mile wide across Door county.  The tornado came onshore from Green Bay at Murphy Park, on the Door county west coast at 630 pm.  Thousands of trees were flattened in the heavily wooded area.  About 30 homes, businesses and barns were destroyed or heavily damaged by the storm, but only two minor injuries were reported.  Some livestock, however, including five horses, were lost.  The tornado knocked down seven power poles holding electrical transmission lines, bringing blackouts to most of the north half of Door county.  Thirty adults and 17 children at a campground found refuge in a concrete building as the tornado approached the grounds.  Two minor injuries occurred at the camping resort as it took a direct hit.  The twister made it almost two-thirds of the way across the county, before dissipating about 3 miles west of the Door county east coast.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 4.74M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

It moved into Central Illinois's County Warning Area (CWA) around 4 pm in Knox County and exited the CWA (Lawrence County) around 830 pm.  Damage was reported in all 35 counties with this system.  The overall general area of wind damage was produced by the passage of the bow echo's "gust front" on the leading edge of the line of thunderstorms.  Wind speeds were measured or estimated to be between 60 to 80 mph, blowing down or uprooting thousands of trees, tree limbs, power poles, and power lines.  Hundreds of trees fell onto structures causing damage ranging from just torn guttering to major roof and structural damage.  Also, hundreds of vehicles sustained damage from fallen trees and numerous outbuildings, sheds, and silos were either damaged or destroyed.  Considerable crop damage was sustained in most areas.  In some areas, more intense damage was observed, caused by stronger wind speeds.  Speeds were measured or estimated in these areas at 100 to 110 mph.  These areas of damage were apparently "microbursts" produced by a series of mesocyclones that formed on the forward edges of the bow echo.  These microbursts, or swaths of more intense wind damage were generally about 1/2 a mile in width.  In these areas significant structural damage occurred, such as peeling off roofs, blowing over freight railroad cars, bending steel power poles, and other structural damage.  A third phenomena that occurred with this event were spin-up tornadoes along the leading edge of the bow echo structure.  These tornadoes caused significant damage in narrow swaths along the bow echo's path and were often masked by the microburst damage occurring adjacent to them.  Based on valid spotter observations and mesocyclone signatures on doppler radar, the existence of these tornadoes was validated.  Overall, approximately twelve people sustained injuries and damage was estimated around $16 million.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornado touched down 3.5 miles southwest of Williamsfield.  It destroyed a steel corn crib, blew down a large tree which damaged a home.  Also, several windows were blown out on the home.  As the tornado travelled east it caused major tree damage for a mile.  Then it blew a large tree onto another home and destroyed an empty silo.  Next it destroyed a barn and two outbuildings, knocked yet another  tree onto a home, as well as, breaking several windows and blowing several 2x4s into the home.  Further down the road, the roof and east walls of two homes were destroyed.  Then for the last half of a mile, ten power poles were blown down, as well as, numerous trees and a barn sustained moderate damage.  One woman sustained minor injuries from flying glass.

This system dragged a warm front northeastward across central New York.  A southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for severe weather that afternoon and evening as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From early in the afternoon until the evening hours, central New York was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, six separate tornadoes touched down on this day in central New York.  The most devastating twister cut a discontinuous sixty plus mile track from southeastern Tioga county across southern Broome county and into Delaware county where it finally lifted back into the cloud base.  This tornado alone damaged or destroyed more than 30 homes and injured nearly 20 people.  Very fortunately, no fatalities occurred.  Another violent tornado ripped through southern sections of Otsego county between Laurens and Milford.  Thousands of trees were snapped off or uprooted with large sections of forest completely taken out.  Several residences were leveled and many roads were impassable for days due to the fallen debris.  The damage toll from this day's tornadoes ran into the millions.     Several strong bow echo complexes also affected central New York.  From southern Chenango county through the lower half of Otsego county, one such storm took out hundreds of trees and inflicted considerable structural damage in and around Oneonta.  One man was killed in Oneonta when hit by a falling tree limb.  Throughout Onondaga county, wind gusts estimated at 90 to 100 mph caused widespread damage early in the evening between 6:00 and 6:30 pm EDT.  Two large transmission towers near Nedrow were toppled from the winds and many buildings had blown out windows and/or roof damage.     Hail as large as 3 to 4 inches in diameter accompanied some of the tornadic supercells across New York's southern tier; smashing windows, severely denting cars, and causing crop losses.  New York State Electric and Gas Company estimated that hundreds of thousands of customers were without power during the height of the storms late that afternoon and evening.  Some of the more remote locations did not have power restored for the better part of a week.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A tornadic supercell ripped across southern sections of the county between approximately 5:35 pm and 6:45 pm EDT.  Tornado intensities varied from F0 to F3 along this path.  Hailstones as large as baseballs and tea cups were also observed along the cell's southern and western flanks.       A tornado which affected Apalachin in southeastern Tioga county crossed the county line and into the town of Vestal around 5:35 pm EDT.  At this point, the tornado was rated as F0 intensity with the width of the damage path around 70 yards.  Damage was primarily to trees with some large trees uprooted and/or twisted off over hilltop sections.  As the cell moved further east into the town of Binghamton, the tornado intensified to category F2 with the damage width increasing to around 100 yards.  In this location, the damage became increasingly severe with more structures affected.  The local ABC affiliate in the town of Binghamton sustained major damage.  A 1000 foot television tower was twisted and toppled to the ground.  A large trash dumpster was lifted off the ground and tossed into two satellite dishes, then thrown about 100 yards further over an embankment.  A sport utility vehicle was rolled over several times as witnessed by a television crew member.  Another vehicle was also moved and a video tape was carried over a mile and a half away from the station.  Several small trailers were also flattened in Binghamton just east of Ingraham Hill and others had minor roof damage.  Two serious injuries occurred when a trailer collapsed upon the two female occupants who were in the kitchen at the time.      Between approximately 6:20 and 6:45 pm EDT, the tornado moved further east through Conklin, Kirkwood, Windsor, and eventually to the Sanford/Deposit area.  In the towns of Conklin and Kirkwood, the tornado maintained an F2 intensity.  More than a dozen homes took on damage as the twister moved through.  For the majority of these residences, damage was restricted to shingles and/or portions of the siding torn off or damaged from falling trees.  However, there were several trailers that were nearly or completely destroyed within the direct path of the tornado in the town of Conklin.  For one such trailer, its wreckage was strewn downstream for more than a quarter of a mile.  As the twister moved into the town of Windsor, it briefly weakened to F0 intensity.  At that point, touchdown locations appeared to be restriced to a few scattered spots with damage consisting of tree tops snapped or twisted off.     Once the tornado reached the town of Sanford, it reintensified and reached category F3.  A well built house was totally destroyed.  The only part of the structure left standing was a small interior closet.  Also, a wide swath of trees were flattened near a power company sub-station.  Trees were twisted off and blown in all directions with hundreds of them estimated to be toppled.  Local residents observed hail to 3 inches in diameter near the path of the tornado.  Fortunately, as the twister reached its greatest intensity, it affected areas that were more sparsely populated.       In all, county emergency management officials estimated damage totals near 1.5 million dollars.  Dozens of structures were severely damaged or destroyed and thousands of trees were cut down.  Twelve injuries were sustained in total with very fortunately no loss of life.  In some of the more remote areas, it took the better part of a week to restore power.  Two of the three local television affiliates were knocked off the air for a time on the evening of the 31st with several radio stations also suffering through service interruptions for up to three days.  The towns of Binghamton, Conklin, and Sanford were put under a local state of emergency and also ultimately declared federal disaster areas.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1.5M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

This system dragged a warm front northeastward across central New York.  A southerly flow of warm, moist, and unstable air quickly developed.  This set the stage for severe weather that afternoon and evening as a cold front and strong upper air disturbance approached.       From early in the afternoon until the evening hours, central New York was under siege from severe thunderstorms, including several tornadic supercells.  In all, six separate tornadoes touched down on this day in central New York.  The most devastating twister cut a discontinuous sixty plus mile track from southeastern Tioga county across southern Broome county and into Delaware county where it finally lifted back into the cloud base.  This tornado alone damaged or destroyed more than 30 homes and injured nearly 20 people.  Very fortunately, no fatalities occurred.  Another violent tornado ripped through southern sections of Otsego county between Laurens and Milford.  Thousands of trees were snapped off or uprooted with large sections of forest completely taken out.  Several residences were leveled and many roads were impassable for days due to the fallen debris.  The damage toll from this day's tornadoes ran into the millions.     Several strong bow echo complexes also affected central New York.  From southern Chenango county through the lower half of Otsego county, one such storm took out hundreds of trees and inflicted considerable structural damage in and around Oneonta.  One man was killed in Oneonta when hit by a falling tree limb.  Throughout Onondaga county, wind gusts estimated at 90 to 100 mph caused widespread damage early in the evening between 6:00 and 6:30 pm EDT.  Two large transmission towers near Nedrow were toppled from the winds and many buildings had blown out windows and/or roof damage.     Hail as large as 3 to 4 inches in diameter accompanied some of the tornadic supercells across New York's southern tier; smashing windows, severely denting cars, and causing crop losses.

Two walls of the building housing the indoor pool of the Sheridan Swimming Club were blown away. The tornado had been spotted by lifeguards as it approached enabling all occupants to be moved to shelter areas. Only 1 minor injury occurred when a lifeguard was struck in the leg by flying glass.

The storm continued along federal highway(s) 50/220 to Ridgeville, rolling one mobile home, causing minor damage to nearby buildings, and destroying a barn near the Mill Creek Country Club just west of Burlington.  From there, the tornado continued over Patterson Creek Mountain and into Hampshire Co, where several mobile homes were damaged or rolled along Davy Road.  Five persons in one of the homes sustained minor injuries; only one accepted transport to a local hospital for head trauma.  A station wagon was completely turned around and sustained minor damage.  The twister then tracked three miles south of Junction, where it likely dissipated.Hail was associated with each mini-supercell - and several residents, including fruit farmers, noted varying amounts of damage due to prolonged and, in some cases, sizeable hail.

Initially, the surface warm front was located to the south of this system.  That was not actually the case aloft however.  During the predawn hours the surface front surged north and by sunrise was located across northeast Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable to the south of the front with dew point temperatures will in the 70s F.  The initial development of thunderstorms took place during the early part of the day over northeast Nebraska.  The storms became severe quickly as they moved and developed eastward into Iowa.  By mid morning, the storms had formed a nearly east to west line.  Storm relative inflow into the line was around 40 knots.  The storms produced a variety of severe weather across Iowa.  They initially moved east across the northern and central counties, but then began sinking sinking southeast.  The dominant severe weather with the storms was extremely high winds.  Damage was very widespread across the state.  Winds in excess of 100 MPH were reported with one unofficial wind speed measured at 126 MPH in the town of Washington at 1405 CST.  In one unusual story, high winds hit Mahaska County.  Three miles south of New Sharon, a puppy was tied to its dog house which was picked up by the wind.  The dog house and puppy were lifted over the top of a two car garage and a corn crib.  Both were deposited in the farm yard.  When found the dog house was upside down and the puppy, though scared, was fine.  There were several tornadoes during the event.  One of the longer track well defined tornadoes was the initial tornado.  It was on the ground for about 11 miles as it swept across Crawford County.  Several residences, outbuildings, grain bins, and trees were damaged along its path.  Reports indicate that between 30 and 50 residences were damaged by this tornado.  There were several small tornadoes in central Iowa.  They had short tracks and only touched down briefly.  One cut a mile long path east of Marshalltown through a corn field and a grove of trees.  Another in Dallas County was on the ground through mostly open country for two miles.  High winds were a major problem with these storms.  Many places reported winds over 80 MPH with incredible tree damage and numerous buildings damaged or destroyed.  At least 38 counties were declared disaster areas by the Federal Government due to the severe damage and flooding.  A final total will not be available before publication deadlines, however preliminary data have been included.  In the Des Moines County Warning Area these included:  Wright, Franklin, Butler, Bremer, Hamilton, Hardin, Grundy, Crawford, Carroll, Greene, Boone, Story, Marshall,  Audubon, Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Jasper, Cass, Adair, Madison, Warren, Marion, Adams, and Taylor.  One of the hardest hit Counties was Polk County.  Damage appeared to be from straight line winds based on a storm survey that was done following the event.  The damage occurred over the southwest semicircle of a large meso low in contact with the ground.  Due to the rapid translational speed of 50 to 75 MPH, winds were enhanced on the southwest semicircle of the meso low.  Smaller scale winds could have been embedded within this circulation as well.  There was little evidence of small scale convergent tornadic damage, however aerial surveys did make some suggestion and eye witness accounts of sightings were quite numerous in the metro Des Moines area.  All trees and debris were laid down to the south or southeast.  The major damage swath as 3 to 7 miles wide northwest of Camp Dodge, with a widening into a full blown derecho after that.  The event was born a few miles northwest of Perry, between Rippey and Berkley in southwest Boone County.  The mile wide damage path expanded to over 3 miles by the time it reached full intensity near highway 169 between Woodward and Perry.  The path continued through Granger, Camp Dodge, and Johnston.  The path was nearly 7 miles wide near Granger.  A second, smaller, meso low passed near Madrid, downing power lines.  This meso low matured near Jester Park Golf Course, causing significant structural damage to houses.  The two meso lows merged near the NWS Forecast Office in Johnston, with two miles of power poles snapped off between Johnston and Granger.  Much of the damage along the most severe track was in the F1 intensity category, with speeds in the 75 to 110 MPH range.  A few spots along the path, such as in the Granger and Camp Dodge area, sustained sufficient damage to justify F2 winds, 110 to 155 MPH.  It appears a tornado or family of tornadoes touched down southeast of Berkley and moved southeast into the Pleasant Hill area just east of Des Moines.  The track was intermittent, indicating either one tornado touching down occasionally, or one or more weak tornadoes rotating around the meso circulation.  The worst effected metro areas were the Granger area, Johnston, and the northeast side of Des Moines proper.  A duplex in Granger was flattened by the winds.  There were several reports of roofs being ripped off of stores and houses in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Several small private planes were flipped at a small air field north of Des Moines.  There were also several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being blown over on Interstate 35.  Heavy construction equipment was overturned on Interstate 35/80 just north of Des Moines.  Damage was extensive to the east side of Des Moines proper.  To make matters worse, following the passage of the main line of thunderstorms, a second line of severe thunderstorms developed and moved across the same areas already hit.  The storms were smaller, but did produce brief tornado touch downs and hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter.  The second line of storms did eventually combine with the first and moved southeast across the rest of the state.  Damage was widespread across the state and it will be months before final numbers are in.  Estimates from Polk County alone are near $100 million in damage including cleanup.  Totals were still being tallied at this writing, however a few include over $11 million in damage from initial claims in Johnston and $726,000 from West Des Moines just to city buildings and systems.  West Des Moines was on the far west edge of the major damage however.  In addition to the property damage, at least 125 people were injured during the storm.  Most of the injuries were caused by flying debris and many were not serious.  Fortunately there were no fatalities.  Heavy damage was reported by MidAmerica Energy.  On a state wide report, they indicated 200,000 homes  were without electricity, effecting over 500,000 people, at one time during the storm.  In the metropolitan Des Moines area, 100,000 homes were without electricity at the height of the storm.  That number was reduced to around 25,000 36 hours later.  The worst damaged areas were without power for 5 to 6 days.  Heavy damage was also reported by local telephone and cable systems.  In Polk County, the worst damage extended from the Camp Dodge area into the northeast parts of Des Moines.  At least 462 homes in the metro Des Moines area sustained significant damage.  Statewide, 80 homes were destroyed, 559 sustained severe damage, with 1416 others receiving moderate damage.  In the Camp Dodge area, 80 to 90 percent of the brick buildings were damaged with the roofs removed from many of them.  Lightning from the storms struck the WSR-88D in the midst of the storm.  The radar was taken out of service for more than 24 hours because of this.  In addition to the severe weather, flooding quickly became a problem.  Iowa soil was nearly saturated as the weather pattern had been very wet for six weeks previous.  Although rainfall was not extreme, one to three inches of rain fell over a several county area.  This caused widespread urban flooding across north central into central Iowa, though damage from the flooding was not serious.  Crop damage was very difficult to determine and will not likely be clear until the fall harvest.  Reports from some of the local extension agents say damage to the corn ranged up to 75% destroyed in areas with the highest wind, such as the swath that went through central Iowa in association with the tornado there.  No doubt losses will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not in the millions.   Accounts of damage were of course too numerous to document here as the areal extent of the storms was very large.  Countless reports of parts of crop fields being flattened were received.  Semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned by the high winds both in the Des Moines metro area as well as in Newton.  Trees were found on houses over a large part of the state.  One news reported wrote "there is not a power pole standing between Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa".  Though not figuratively true, this statement does point out the extensive damage that occurred with these storms.l<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Initially, the surface warm front was located to the south of this system.  That was not actually the case aloft however.  During the predawn hours the surface front surged north and by sunrise was located across northeast Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable to the south of the front with dew point temperatures will in the 70s F.  The initial development of thunderstorms took place during the early part of the day over northeast Nebraska.  The storms became severe quickly as they moved and developed eastward into Iowa.  By mid morning, the storms had formed a nearly east to west line.  Storm relative inflow into the line was around 40 knots.  The storms produced a variety of severe weather across Iowa.  They initially moved east across the northern and central counties, but then began sinking sinking southeast.  The dominant severe weather with the storms was extremely high winds.  Damage was very widespread across the state.  Winds in excess of 100 MPH were reported with one unofficial wind speed measured at 126 MPH in the town of Washington at 1405 CST.  In one unusual story, high winds hit Mahaska County.  Three miles south of New Sharon, a puppy was tied to its dog house which was picked up by the wind.  The dog house and puppy were lifted over the top of a two car garage and a corn crib.  Both were deposited in the farm yard.  When found the dog house was upside down and the puppy, though scared, was fine.  There were several tornadoes during the event.  One of the longer track well defined tornadoes was the initial tornado.  It was on the ground for about 11 miles as it swept across Crawford County.  Several residences, outbuildings, grain bins, and trees were damaged along its path.  Reports indicate that between 30 and 50 residences were damaged by this tornado.  There were several small tornadoes in central Iowa.  They had short tracks and only touched down briefly.  One cut a mile long path east of Marshalltown through a corn field and a grove of trees.  Another in Dallas County was on the ground through mostly open country for two miles.  High winds were a major problem with these storms.  Many places reported winds over 80 MPH with incredible tree damage and numerous buildings damaged or destroyed.  At least 38 counties were declared disaster areas by the Federal Government due to the severe damage and flooding.  A final total will not be available before publication deadlines, however preliminary data have been included.  In the Des Moines County Warning Area these included:  Wright, Franklin, Butler, Bremer, Hamilton, Hardin, Grundy, Crawford, Carroll, Greene, Boone, Story, Marshall,  Audubon, Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Jasper, Cass, Adair, Madison, Warren, Marion, Adams, and Taylor.  One of the hardest hit Counties was Polk County.  Damage appeared to be from straight line winds based on a storm survey that was done following the event.  The damage occurred over the southwest semicircle of a large meso low in contact with the ground.  Due to the rapid translational speed of 50 to 75 MPH, winds were enhanced on the southwest semicircle of the meso low.  Smaller scale winds could have been embedded within this circulation as well.  There was little evidence of small scale convergent tornadic damage, however aerial surveys did make some suggestion and eye witness accounts of sightings were quite numerous in the metro Des Moines area.  All trees and debris were laid down to the south or southeast.  The major damage swath as 3 to 7 miles wide northwest of Camp Dodge, with a widening into a full blown derecho after that.  The event was born a few miles northwest of Perry, between Rippey and Berkley in southwest Boone County.  The mile wide damage path expanded to over 3 miles by the time it reached full intensity near highway 169 between Woodward and Perry.  The path continued through Granger, Camp Dodge, and Johnston.  The path was nearly 7 miles wide near Granger.  A second, smaller, meso low passed near Madrid, downing power lines.  This meso low matured near Jester Park Golf Course, causing significant structural damage to houses.  The two meso lows merged near the NWS Forecast Office in Johnston, with two miles of power poles snapped off between Johnston and Granger.  Much of the damage along the most severe track was in the F1 intensity category, with speeds in the 75 to 110 MPH range.  A few spots along the path, such as in the Granger and Camp Dodge area, sustained sufficient damage to justify F2 winds, 110 to 155 MPH.  It appears a tornado or family of tornadoes touched down southeast of Berkley and moved southeast into the Pleasant Hill area just east of Des Moines.  The track was intermittent, indicating either one tornado touching down occasionally, or one or more weak tornadoes rotating around the meso circulation.  The worst effected metro areas were the Granger area, Johnston, and the northeast side of Des Moines proper.  A duplex in Granger was flattened by the winds.  There were several reports of roofs being ripped off of stores and houses in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Several small private planes were flipped at a small air field north of Des Moines.  There were also several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being blown over on Interstate 35.  Heavy construction equipment was overturned on Interstate 35/80 just north of Des Moines.  Damage was extensive to the east side of Des Moines proper.  To make matters worse, following the passage of the main line of thunderstorms, a second line of severe thunderstorms developed and moved across the same areas already hit.  The storms were smaller, but did produce brief tornado touch downs and hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter.  The second line of storms did eventually combine with the first and moved southeast across the rest of the state.  Damage was widespread across the state and it will be months before final numbers are in.  Estimates from Polk County alone are near $100 million in damage including cleanup.  Totals were still being tallied at this writing, however a few include over $11 million in damage from initial claims in Johnston and $726,000 from West Des Moines just to city buildings and systems.  West Des Moines was on the far west edge of the major damage however.  In addition to the property damage, at least 125 people were injured during the storm.  Most of the injuries were caused by flying debris and many were not serious.  Fortunately there were no fatalities.  Heavy damage was reported by MidAmerica Energy.  On a state wide report, they indicated 200,000 homes  were without electricity, effecting over 500,000 people, at one time during the storm.  In the metropolitan Des Moines area, 100,000 homes were without electricity at the height of the storm.  That number was reduced to around 25,000 36 hours later.  The worst damaged areas were without power for 5 to 6 days.  Heavy damage was also reported by local telephone and cable systems.  In Polk County, the worst damage extended from the Camp Dodge area into the northeast parts of Des Moines.  At least 462 homes in the metro Des Moines area sustained significant damage.  Statewide, 80 homes were destroyed, 559 sustained severe damage, with 1416 others receiving moderate damage.  In the Camp Dodge area, 80 to 90 percent of the brick buildings were damaged with the roofs removed from many of them.  Lightning from the storms struck the WSR-88D in the midst of the storm.  The radar was taken out of service for more than 24 hours because of this.  In addition to the severe weather, flooding quickly became a problem.  Iowa soil was nearly saturated as the weather pattern had been very wet for six weeks previous.  Although rainfall was not extreme, one to three inches of rain fell over a several county area.  This caused widespread urban flooding across north central into central Iowa, though damage from the flooding was not serious.  Crop damage was very difficult to determine and will not likely be clear until the fall harvest.  Reports from some of the local extension agents say damage to the corn ranged up to 75% destroyed in areas with the highest wind, such as the swath that went through central Iowa in association with the tornado there.  No doubt losses will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not in the millions.   Accounts of damage were of course too numerous to document here as the areal extent of the storms was very large.  Countless reports of parts of crop fields being flattened were received.  Semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned by the high winds both in the Des Moines metro area as well as in Newton.  Trees were found on houses over a large part of the state.  One news reported wrote "there is not a power pole standing between Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa".  Though not figuratively true, this statement does point out the extensive damage that occurred with these storms.l<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Initially, the surface warm front was located to the south of this system.  That was not actually the case aloft however.  During the predawn hours the surface front surged north and by sunrise was located across northeast Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable to the south of the front with dew point temperatures will in the 70s F.  The initial development of thunderstorms took place during the early part of the day over northeast Nebraska.  The storms became severe quickly as they moved and developed eastward into Iowa.  By mid morning, the storms had formed a nearly east to west line.  Storm relative inflow into the line was around 40 knots.  The storms produced a variety of severe weather across Iowa.  They initially moved east across the northern and central counties, but then began sinking sinking southeast.  The dominant severe weather with the storms was extremely high winds.  Damage was very widespread across the state.  Winds in excess of 100 MPH were reported with one unofficial wind speed measured at 126 MPH in the town of Washington at 1405 CST.  In one unusual story, high winds hit Mahaska County.  Three miles south of New Sharon, a puppy was tied to its dog house which was picked up by the wind.  The dog house and puppy were lifted over the top of a two car garage and a corn crib.  Both were deposited in the farm yard.  When found the dog house was upside down and the puppy, though scared, was fine.  There were several tornadoes during the event.  One of the longer track well defined tornadoes was the initial tornado.  It was on the ground for about 11 miles as it swept across Crawford County.  Several residences, outbuildings, grain bins, and trees were damaged along its path.  Reports indicate that between 30 and 50 residences were damaged by this tornado.  There were several small tornadoes in central Iowa.  They had short tracks and only touched down briefly.  One cut a mile long path east of Marshalltown through a corn field and a grove of trees.  Another in Dallas County was on the ground through mostly open country for two miles.  High winds were a major problem with these storms.  Many places reported winds over 80 MPH with incredible tree damage and numerous buildings damaged or destroyed.  At least 38 counties were declared disaster areas by the Federal Government due to the severe damage and flooding.  A final total will not be available before publication deadlines, however preliminary data have been included.  In the Des Moines County Warning Area these included:  Wright, Franklin, Butler, Bremer, Hamilton, Hardin, Grundy, Crawford, Carroll, Greene, Boone, Story, Marshall,  Audubon, Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Jasper, Cass, Adair, Madison, Warren, Marion, Adams, and Taylor.  One of the hardest hit Counties was Polk County.  Damage appeared to be from straight line winds based on a storm survey that was done following the event.  The damage occurred over the southwest semicircle of a large meso low in contact with the ground.  Due to the rapid translational speed of 50 to 75 MPH, winds were enhanced on the southwest semicircle of the meso low.  Smaller scale winds could have been embedded within this circulation as well.  There was little evidence of small scale convergent tornadic damage, however aerial surveys did make some suggestion and eye witness accounts of sightings were quite numerous in the metro Des Moines area.  All trees and debris were laid down to the south or southeast.  The major damage swath as 3 to 7 miles wide northwest of Camp Dodge, with a widening into a full blown derecho after that.  The event was born a few miles northwest of Perry, between Rippey and Berkley in southwest Boone County.  The mile wide damage path expanded to over 3 miles by the time it reached full intensity near highway 169 between Woodward and Perry.  The path continued through Granger, Camp Dodge, and Johnston.  The path was nearly 7 miles wide near Granger.  A second, smaller, meso low passed near Madrid, downing power lines.  This meso low matured near Jester Park Golf Course, causing significant structural damage to houses.  The two meso lows merged near the NWS Forecast Office in Johnston, with two miles of power poles snapped off between Johnston and Granger.  Much of the damage along the most severe track was in the F1 intensity category, with speeds in the 75 to 110 MPH range.  A few spots along the path, such as in the Granger and Camp Dodge area, sustained sufficient damage to justify F2 winds, 110 to 155 MPH.  It appears a tornado or family of tornadoes touched down southeast of Berkley and moved southeast into the Pleasant Hill area just east of Des Moines.  The track was intermittent, indicating either one tornado touching down occasionally, or one or more weak tornadoes rotating around the meso circulation.  The worst effected metro areas were the Granger area, Johnston, and the northeast side of Des Moines proper.  A duplex in Granger was flattened by the winds.  There were several reports of roofs being ripped off of stores and houses in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Several small private planes were flipped at a small air field north of Des Moines.  There were also several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being blown over on Interstate 35.  Heavy construction equipment was overturned on Interstate 35/80 just north of Des Moines.  Damage was extensive to the east side of Des Moines proper.  To make matters worse, following the passage of the main line of thunderstorms, a second line of severe thunderstorms developed and moved across the same areas already hit.  The storms were smaller, but did produce brief tornado touch downs and hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter.  The second line of storms did eventually combine with the first and moved southeast across the rest of the state.  Damage was widespread across the state and it will be months before final numbers are in.  Estimates from Polk County alone are near $100 million in damage including cleanup.  Totals were still being tallied at this writing, however a few include over $11 million in damage from initial claims in Johnston and $726,000 from West Des Moines just to city buildings and systems.  West Des Moines was on the far west edge of the major damage however.  In addition to the property damage, at least 125 people were injured during the storm.  Most of the injuries were caused by flying debris and many were not serious.  Fortunately there were no fatalities.  Heavy damage was reported by MidAmerica Energy.  On a state wide report, they indicated 200,000 homes  were without electricity, effecting over 500,000 people, at one time during the storm.  In the metropolitan Des Moines area, 100,000 homes were without electricity at the height of the storm.  That number was reduced to around 25,000 36 hours later.  The worst damaged areas were without power for 5 to 6 days.  Heavy damage was also reported by local telephone and cable systems.  In Polk County, the worst damage extended from the Camp Dodge area into the northeast parts of Des Moines.  At least 462 homes in the metro Des Moines area sustained significant damage.  Statewide, 80 homes were destroyed, 559 sustained severe damage, with 1416 others receiving moderate damage.  In the Camp Dodge area, 80 to 90 percent of the brick buildings were damaged with the roofs removed from many of them.  Lightning from the storms struck the WSR-88D in the midst of the storm.  The radar was taken out of service for more than 24 hours because of this.  In addition to the severe weather, flooding quickly became a problem.  Iowa soil was nearly saturated as the weather pattern had been very wet for six weeks previous.  Although rainfall was not extreme, one to three inches of rain fell over a several county area.  This caused widespread urban flooding across north central into central Iowa, though damage from the flooding was not serious.  Crop damage was very difficult to determine and will not likely be clear until the fall harvest.  Reports from some of the local extension agents say damage to the corn ranged up to 75% destroyed in areas with the highest wind, such as the swath that went through central Iowa in association with the tornado there.  No doubt losses will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not in the millions.   Accounts of damage were of course too numerous to document here as the areal extent of the storms was very large.  Countless reports of parts of crop fields being flattened were received.  Semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned by the high winds both in the Des Moines metro area as well as in Newton.  Trees were found on houses over a large part of the state.  One news reported wrote "there is not a power pole standing between Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa".  Though not figuratively true, this statement does point out the extensive damage that occurred with these storms.l<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Initially, the surface warm front was located to the south of this system.  That was not actually the case aloft however.  During the predawn hours the surface front surged north and by sunrise was located across northeast Nebraska across northern Iowa.  The airmass was very unstable to the south of the front with dew point temperatures will in the 70s F.  The initial development of thunderstorms took place during the early part of the day over northeast Nebraska.  The storms became severe quickly as they moved and developed eastward into Iowa.  By mid morning, the storms had formed a nearly east to west line.  Storm relative inflow into the line was around 40 knots.  The storms produced a variety of severe weather across Iowa.  They initially moved east across the northern and central counties, but then began sinking sinking southeast.  The dominant severe weather with the storms was extremely high winds.  Damage was very widespread across the state.  Winds in excess of 100 MPH were reported with one unofficial wind speed measured at 126 MPH in the town of Washington at 1405 CST.  In one unusual story, high winds hit Mahaska County.  Three miles south of New Sharon, a puppy was tied to its dog house which was picked up by the wind.  The dog house and puppy were lifted over the top of a two car garage and a corn crib.  Both were deposited in the farm yard.  When found the dog house was upside down and the puppy, though scared, was fine.  There were several tornadoes during the event.  One of the longer track well defined tornadoes was the initial tornado.  It was on the ground for about 11 miles as it swept across Crawford County.  Several residences, outbuildings, grain bins, and trees were damaged along its path.  Reports indicate that between 30 and 50 residences were damaged by this tornado.  There were several small tornadoes in central Iowa.  They had short tracks and only touched down briefly.  One cut a mile long path east of Marshalltown through a corn field and a grove of trees.  Another in Dallas County was on the ground through mostly open country for two miles.  High winds were a major problem with these storms.  Many places reported winds over 80 MPH with incredible tree damage and numerous buildings damaged or destroyed.  At least 38 counties were declared disaster areas by the Federal Government due to the severe damage and flooding.  A final total will not be available before publication deadlines, however preliminary data have been included.  In the Des Moines County Warning Area these included:  Wright, Franklin, Butler, Bremer, Hamilton, Hardin, Grundy, Crawford, Carroll, Greene, Boone, Story, Marshall,  Audubon, Guthrie, Dallas, Polk, Jasper, Cass, Adair, Madison, Warren, Marion, Adams, and Taylor.  One of the hardest hit Counties was Polk County.  Damage appeared to be from straight line winds based on a storm survey that was done following the event.  The damage occurred over the southwest semicircle of a large meso low in contact with the ground.  Due to the rapid translational speed of 50 to 75 MPH, winds were enhanced on the southwest semicircle of the meso low.  Smaller scale winds could have been embedded within this circulation as well.  There was little evidence of small scale convergent tornadic damage, however aerial surveys did make some suggestion and eye witness accounts of sightings were quite numerous in the metro Des Moines area.  All trees and debris were laid down to the south or southeast.  The major damage swath as 3 to 7 miles wide northwest of Camp Dodge, with a widening into a full blown derecho after that.  The event was born a few miles northwest of Perry, between Rippey and Berkley in southwest Boone County.  The mile wide damage path expanded to over 3 miles by the time it reached full intensity near highway 169 between Woodward and Perry.  The path continued through Granger, Camp Dodge, and Johnston.  The path was nearly 7 miles wide near Granger.  A second, smaller, meso low passed near Madrid, downing power lines.  This meso low matured near Jester Park Golf Course, causing significant structural damage to houses.  The two meso lows merged near the NWS Forecast Office in Johnston, with two miles of power poles snapped off between Johnston and Granger.  Much of the damage along the most severe track was in the F1 intensity category, with speeds in the 75 to 110 MPH range.  A few spots along the path, such as in the Granger and Camp Dodge area, sustained sufficient damage to justify F2 winds, 110 to 155 MPH.  It appears a tornado or family of tornadoes touched down southeast of Berkley and moved southeast into the Pleasant Hill area just east of Des Moines.  The track was intermittent, indicating either one tornado touching down occasionally, or one or more weak tornadoes rotating around the meso circulation.  The worst effected metro areas were the Granger area, Johnston, and the northeast side of Des Moines proper.  A duplex in Granger was flattened by the winds.  There were several reports of roofs being ripped off of stores and houses in the metropolitan Des Moines area.  Several small private planes were flipped at a small air field north of Des Moines.  There were also several reports of semi-tractortrailer trucks being blown over on Interstate 35.  Heavy construction equipment was overturned on Interstate 35/80 just north of Des Moines.  Damage was extensive to the east side of Des Moines proper.  To make matters worse, following the passage of the main line of thunderstorms, a second line of severe thunderstorms developed and moved across the same areas already hit.  The storms were smaller, but did produce brief tornado touch downs and hail up to 2.5 inches in diameter.  The second line of storms did eventually combine with the first and moved southeast across the rest of the state.  Damage was widespread across the state and it will be months before final numbers are in.  Estimates from Polk County alone are near $100 million in damage including cleanup.  Totals were still being tallied at this writing, however a few include over $11 million in damage from initial claims in Johnston and $726,000 from West Des Moines just to city buildings and systems.  West Des Moines was on the far west edge of the major damage however.  In addition to the property damage, at least 125 people were injured during the storm.  Most of the injuries were caused by flying debris and many were not serious.  Fortunately there were no fatalities.  Heavy damage was reported by MidAmerica Energy.  On a state wide report, they indicated 200,000 homes  were without electricity, effecting over 500,000 people, at one time during the storm.  In the metropolitan Des Moines area, 100,000 homes were without electricity at the height of the storm.  That number was reduced to around 25,000 36 hours later.  The worst damaged areas were without power for 5 to 6 days.  Heavy damage was also reported by local telephone and cable systems.  In Polk County, the worst damage extended from the Camp Dodge area into the northeast parts of Des Moines.  At least 462 homes in the metro Des Moines area sustained significant damage.  Statewide, 80 homes were destroyed, 559 sustained severe damage, with 1416 others receiving moderate damage.  In the Camp Dodge area, 80 to 90 percent of the brick buildings were damaged with the roofs removed from many of them.  Lightning from the storms struck the WSR-88D in the midst of the storm.  The radar was taken out of service for more than 24 hours because of this.  In addition to the severe weather, flooding quickly became a problem.  Iowa soil was nearly saturated as the weather pattern had been very wet for six weeks previous.  Although rainfall was not extreme, one to three inches of rain fell over a several county area.  This caused widespread urban flooding across north central into central Iowa, though damage from the flooding was not serious.  Crop damage was very difficult to determine and will not likely be clear until the fall harvest.  Reports from some of the local extension agents say damage to the corn ranged up to 75% destroyed in areas with the highest wind, such as the swath that went through central Iowa in association with the tornado there.  No doubt losses will be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars if not in the millions.   Accounts of damage were of course too numerous to document here as the areal extent of the storms was very large.  Countless reports of parts of crop fields being flattened were received.  Semi-tractortrailer trucks were overturned by the high winds both in the Des Moines metro area as well as in Newton.  Trees were found on houses over a large part of the state.  One news reported wrote "there is not a power pole standing between Fort Dodge and Oskaloosa".  Though not figuratively true, this statement does point out the extensive damage that occurred with these storms.l<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 10M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The primary focusing mechanisms were a strong mid level shortwave and surface cold front that approached the region during the evening of the 2nd.  Strongly veering wind profiles that increased with height contributed significantly to the development of tornadic supercells.     Two long tracked supercells produced tornadic damage across northeastern Pennsylvania during this event.  The first tornado touched down in southwestern Susquehanna county in Auburn towship just after 9 pm EDT.  This tornado tracked along a 12 mile path through Springville and Lathrop townships.  Several mobile homes were damaged or destroyed and the roof of a small storage building was torn away.  The twister also cut down scores of trees along the way.  Its intensity was rated as F1.  Fortunately, no injuries resulted.     The other twister tracked along approximately a 35 mile path from extreme southeastern Bradford county across the length of northern Wyoming county and into northwestern Lackawanna county before weakening.  The most devastation occurred in the small vacation community of Lake Carey in Wyoming county.  The tornado strengthened to F3 intensity at Lake Carey and killed two people and injured a total of fifteen.  More than 40 homes immediately surrounding the lake were either heavily damaged or destroyed.  Additional residences were damaged or leveled further to the east through East Lemon township in northern Wyoming county.  Isolated structural damage and considerable tree damage was the rule from Terry township in Bradford county eastward to just west of Lake Carey and also from East Lemon township eastward to near Lackawanna State Park where the tornado finally dissipated.  In all, over 50 homes were damaged or destroyed and total damage estimates in the three county area exceeded three million dollars.     Other smaller scale bow echo complexes produced widespread wind damage in the form of downed trees and power lines primarily across the northern tier counties and sections of the Poconos.  Portions of Bradford, Susquehanna, and Wayne counties were without power for most of the night as electrical crews could not keep up with reports of downed wires.       The most severely damaged areas including the Lake Carey vicinity needed assistance from the National Gaurd to clean up excess debris and help with repairs.  Much of northeastern Pennsylvania qualified for federal disaster assistance.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> The same tornadic supercell that affected southeastern Bradford county moved eastward into northern Wyoming county around 10 pm EDT.  Aerial damage surveys indicate that intervals of tree damage occurred from Meshoppen eastward to near Valentine Hill on the border of Lemon township.  This damage was primarily in the form of twisted off tree sections at canopy level and also some uprooted trees on hilltop areas.       Between 1010 and 1015 pm, the tornado lowered again down the east side of Valentine Hill, skipped across the far north end of Stevens Lake, and carved a path over a small hill just west of Lake Carey.  Several residences along this path had heavy tree damage and minor siding and roof damage to their homes.  The twister then seemed to temporarily turn towards the south and cross a portion of the long axis of Lake Carey.  It was here within this small vacation community that the most severe damage occurred along with loss of life.  Eyewitness accounts indicate that the tornado crossed State Route 1003 (a small causeway across the short axis of the lake in an west-east orientation) at about 1020 pm.  Every structure located along this narrow strip of land crossing Lake Carey either sustained substantial damage or was completely leveled.  It was here where two fatalities occurred as an elderly woman and her grandson were literally sucked out of the second floor of a house and thrown into an adjacent building.  Every nearby tree was snapped off, uprooted, or otherwise toppled in chaotic patterns.  At that point, the tornado made a jog to the left and resumed its eastward course.  It crossed over State Route 1005, which parallels the eastern end of Lake Carey, then skipped up over a small hill.  Again, heavy damage was inflicted upon homes in the path of the tornado both along the east end of the lake and also going up the hill.  A dozen or more small boats which were anchored along the eastern end of the lake were thrown up out of the water and onto the shoreline.  One home going up the hill towards the east was reduced to only its foundation and a portion of the back wall.  Massive tree damage continued to be evident with a swath of trees cut down in a narrow path going over the hill and down its eastern side towards East Lemon township.  A total of 42 homes in and around Lake Carey suffered considerable damage or were totally destroyed.  The character of damage in this area indicates that the tornado strengthened and reached F3 intensity.  The damage path was over a third of a mile wide at times.       As the tornado pushed further to the east through East Lemon township, it encountered more rugged terrain and less populated areas.  Still, however, it did encounter three additional homes and heavily damaged all of them.  One had its roof completely torn away and its garage flattened.  Another had its back deck destroyed and all of the back windows blown out.  Swaths of tree damage were interspersed amongst these houses.  Fortunately, two of the homes were unoccupied at the time with only one other minor injury associated with the storm in East Lemon township.  The tornado was rated as F2 intensity at this point with damage widths varying from 250 to 400 yards.       As the cell approached Factoryville and the Lackawanna county line after 1035 pm EDT, it weakened a bit with the tornado skipping over hilltop sections for the most part.  Mostly tree damage was evident from aerial surveys between Route 92 and Lake Sheridan.  The tornado's intensity had decreased to F1 along this segment of its path with the width of damage narrowing to under 100 yards in spots.     In total, county emergency management officials estimated that in excess of 2 million dollars worth of damage was incurred with over 50 homes destroyed or heavily damaged.  Fifteen injuries were directly tied to the tornado along with the two deaths mentioned earlier.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2.2M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The tornado first touched down in the South Ridge Subdivision where at least 20 homes were virtually destroyed. On Lakespur Court, 5 homes here suffered considerable roof and wall damage as the tornado quickly reached F2 strength. The tornado moved north-northeast and crossed Churchill Street. The upper half of a two-story house in this area was completely destroyed. As the tornado continued northeast, it briefly reached F3 intensity at the corner of Saratoga and Lupine Drives. A ranch home in this area was completely levelled. Other nearby homes in this area sustained severe roof and wall damage. Large trees that were downed fell in a definite convergent pattern.  The tornado tracked northeast across Balmoral and Caliente Courts and Hialeah Drive. About 15 homes in this area sustained major damage. Several homes in this area were speared by 2 by 4 boards driven by the wind. Severe roof damage was also noted on several homes on Solano Court. The tornado caused significant damage to seven large homes on Le Mesa Drive. It was noted in this area that the walls of two homes were drawn in toward the center axis of the tornado. The tornado crossed Highway 63 and caused at least $400,000 in damage in the Concorde Office and Industrial Plaza. Metal roofs and walls and loading dock doors were blown away on several buildings. At one warehouse, the damage tripped the sprinkler system which then flooded the inside of the building.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 6M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

A mobile home was picked up and pushed westward.  It was then rolled over and destroyed.  Two people inside the trailer at the time were injured.  A double-wide modular home lost its entire roof and was essentially totalled.  A two-story frame home was severely damaged, with parts of the roof and walls blown off.

A mobile home was picked up and pushed westward.  It was then rolled over and destroyed.  Two people inside the trailer at the time were injured.  A double-wide modular home lost its entire roof and was essentially totalled.  A two-story frame home was severely damaged, with parts of the roof and walls blown off.

Strong to severe thunderstorms developed rapidly in northern Maryland and tracked east-southeast into east-central and lower southern Maryland during the early evening.  The main culprits for damage were gusty winds and lightning, through a few occurrences of large hail were noted.Initial thunderstorms produced large hail in central Baltimore and northern Carroll Cos during the mid afternoon.  The real action began during the early evening commuting hours, when a severe thunderstorm knocked down numerous trees and large limbs on an east-southeast trek from Reisterstown to Essex.  The same cell produced wind-driven hail which broke windows of several automobiles in Reisterstown.  The flying glass shards injured one occupant of a vehicle; the shards had to be removed from his scalp.  Other wind damage was noted across southern Carroll Co and central Montgomery Co.The final round of storms fired during the mid-evening, producing damaging wind gusts (mainly trees and power lines), first in northern and eastern Anne Arundel Co.  Other storms developed over lower southern Maryland, producing tree and wire damage in St Mary's and Calvert Cos.Lightning was a major factor with the storms.  A lightning death occurred in southwest Baltimore City at 1730EST when two youngsters were running home to escape the storm.  They made it to the shelter of a large tree, which was struck.  The attendant current burned over half of the deceased's (a nine-year old girl) body.   Her 8 year-old friend survived with lesser burns.  Farther south, a small house fire was ignited by a lightning strike in Arnold.  Power outages of at least 33,000 Southern Maryland Electric Co. customers were directly attributed to a lightning strike at a supply station in St Mary's Co.  In all, at least 50,000 Maryland residents west of the Chesapeake Bay lost electricity during the outbreak of storms.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

In spite of the instability, the atmosphere was capped by very warm air aloft.  Temperatures at the 700 mb level were between 12 degrees C and 14 degrees C.  As a result, thunderstorms had a difficult time forming.  The atmosphere was primed with CAPE values in the 4000 to 6000 J/kg range by late morning.  Helicity values were near 300 M2/S2.  One cell was able to break the cap and became severe.  It was a prolific hail producer as well as spawning several tornadoes.  Hail reports indicated frequent baseball size hail with a few reports to softball size and larger.  The largest report was an incredible 5 inch diameter stone north of Gilbert in Story County.  The damage caused was incredible.  In some town, every north facing window was broken out by the hail.  On one building, the hail was so large that it broke the stone tile roof in the building, smashing it into pieces.  Property damage was extensive in a swath from Sac County through Marshall County.  Total property damage was estimated to be well in excess of $5,000,000.  In Calhoun County, the town of Lohrville was hard hit by baseball size hail.  Damage in the town was estimated at $1 million as the hail knocked out windows in almost all of the 225 buildings in town.  One injury was reported in Lohrville as a woman was treated for an eye injury as shards of glass flew into her eye from a car windshield broken by the hail.  Crop damage was difficult to assess, but was extensive.  Thousands of acres of crops were shredded by the hail.  In Webster County, estimates of crop damage indicated 24,000+ acres had total crop loss and 20,000+ acres suffered 30-50% loss.  Crop loss in the county was expected to be over $14 million.  In addition to the crop loss, property loss was estimated at between $2 and $4 million.  Many emergency managers described the hail event as the worst in 25 years in some areas to the worst they have ever seen in others.  To give some idea of the severity, the hail was large enough to shatter tile roofs.  Scenes of broken tiles falling off of houses were common.  The hail also took a toll on wildlife.  Numerous Pheasants, rabbits, and other small animals were killed by the hail, not to mention the smashed birds eggs.  The thunderstorm cell itself was a classic cell on WSR-88D radar.  It contained a clear hook echo and bounded weak echo region.  In spite of the structure looking text book perfect, the cell had a hard time producing a tornado.  Several brief touchdowns were reported from northwest of Boone to the vicinity of Boone.  The cell became better organized as it moved into central Iowa.  A tornado touched down in Story County and moved into Marshall County.  This tornado was fairly small and had a very intermittent track.  Storm chasers indicated that the tornado lifted several times during its life.  Damage was limited as the tornado tracked totally across open country and caused only crop damage for the most part.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 1M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Insurance companies reported over 3000 vehicle claims from policy holders.  One insurance company reported damage to more than 100 insured homes.  Total damage to property from the storms in Waushara, Winnebago, Outagamie, Brown and Calumet counties topped $10 million.  Due to the time of year, cash crop damage was minimal.  An elderly women near Wild Rose (Waushara co.) was injured by golfball-size hail when she was caught outside as the storm struck.  A women was injured near Oconto (Oconto co.) when a hailstone hit her shoulder.Lightning struck a couple in Shawano (Shawano co.) while they were in their back yard, tending to their garden.
