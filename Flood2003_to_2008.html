Repetitive showers formed, as dew points of 60 to 65 degrees fed the system from Kentucky.  The heaviest rain rates came toward the end of this prolong period, mainly from 1530E to 1730E, with rates peaking around an inch per hour.  South of the training showers, across Logan and Mingo Counties, the heavy rain was more sudden, the result of the last shot of enhanced rain during the late afternoon.  The heaviest rain totals ran west to east, from Wayne County and southern Cabell County, through northern Lincoln County, central Kanawha County, southern Clay County, and into central Nicholas County.  Branchland's rain total was 4.7 inches.  Hamlin measured 4.4 inches.  The National Weather Service office at Ruthdale had 4.1 inches.  Mount Nebo measured 3.8 inches.  The 3.66 inches at Charleston was the 5th heaviest 24 hour total on record, for any month of the year.   Richwood observed 3.4 inches.  Clendenin and Clay both measured around 3.1 inches.          Severe flooding occurred along streams feeding into the Mud River in Lincoln County, including the Straight Fork.  Homes and businesses around Hamlin were also flooded.  Damage assessment In Lincoln County counted 35 homes destroyed, 80 with major damage, and 80 with minor damage.  The Griffithsville Elementary School was flooded and sustained heavy damage.  It was closed and will not likely reopen.  Duval High School had minor damage.  There were about 20 swift water rescues in the Duval area.  One rescue was an unusual example.  An Army National Guard black hawk helicopter was in the air, practicing night rescues near Parkersburg.  When the request came in for help, the crew raced 65 miles south to Lincoln County and rescued 3 people from a flooded truck.   The Griffithsville Post Office had several feet of water inside.In Kanawha County, one of the hardest hit drainages was Davis Creek, which flows from Kanawha State Forest through Loudendale to South Charleston.  The main branch of Davis Creek, plus its Middle Fork were hit harder, compared to its Trace Fork.  One Loudendale resident said, "It's flooded, but never this bad."  Some homes had 3 feet of water inside.  A 62 year old male drove into the flooded creek around 2000E on the 12th.  Apparently, he had stopped his car for about 5 minutes in the road, since the local fire department had the road barricaded.  Then, it appeared the man was going to turn around in a parking lot, but instead drove between a house and a small store, and into the swollen creek.  His body was recovered the next day, inside the vehicle, about a miles down the stream.  Two South Charleston firefighters rescued a woman along Davis Creek.  One firefighter said, "She was hanging onto a tree limb.  She was hanging on for dear life.  The only thing sticking out of the water was her head and her arm."   Other flooded areas in Kanawha County included Campbells Creek, Georges Creek at Malden, Witcher Creek and Winifrede hollow, plus the Rabol-Broundland-Olcott Roads.  Inside the city limits of Charleston, a woman was rescued after having her body pinned by flood waters against the lip of a culvert.  This occurred along Lick Branch and South Ruffner Road.  The city emergency director described the street as a "rushing river."   In Kanawha County, 44 homes were destroyed, 150 had major damage, and 88 homes had minor damage.   Several private bridges were also destroyed.The crest on the Mud River in Cabell County occurred around 1300E on the 13th, flooding homes and businesses in Milton.  Milton Middle School was damaged.  Damage assessment counted 8 homes destroyed with major damage to 52 and minor damage to 56 dwellings.                     Further east, in Webster and Nicholas Counties, numerous roads were flooded, but damage to homes was less.  Yet, this rain event would set up the town of Richwood and much of this area, for more severe flooding a week later.In Wayne County, most of the damage was in the Dunlow area.  In Logan County, Garrett Fork and the Sharples area flooded.  In Mingo County, the East Fork of Twelvepole Creek saw flooding.  Besides the flood on the Mud River, the Coal and Elk Rivers saw minor flooding.  Crests on the Elk and Coal Rivers would be even higher the following week.This event initiated a federal disaster.  See FEMA disaster #1500.  More counties would be added to the declaration, after the flooding on the 19th into the 20th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 6.6M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

Lowland flooding occurred along the East Fork White River in Jackson County.  The White River in southern Indiana rose to bankfull levels.  This was the result of the melting snow cover.With warm air over Indiana, a storm system brought 2 to 4 inches of rain to much of central and southern Indiana from the 1st through the 3rd.  Because of the saturated soil conditions, widespread local flooding occurred in central and southern Indiana.  The major rivers in the state were flooding by the 4th. Another storm system quickly followed from the 4th through the 6th. This storm system tracked across southern Indiana and brought 2 to possibly 5 inches of rain to central and southern Indiana.  Because much of this rain fell as freezing rain just north of Indianapolis, two very significant weather events occurred; a major ice storm and flood.Major flooding resulted along the White, East Fork White and Wabash River in southern Indiana.  Flood levels that had not been seen in 40, 50 or more than 90 years occurred just south of the Indianapolis area.  New record stages were set at the White River at Edwardsport and the Wabash River at Mount Carmel.  The White River at Hazleton approached its record stage.Flooding in southern Indiana was much worse than the January 1991 flood.  Areas affected in the January 1991 flood were affected again and more severely.  These included Shelbyville, Rushville, Seymour, Wheeler Hollow, Bedford, Shoals, Spencer, Elnora, Edwardsport, Petersburg area, Hazleton, East Mount Carmel and New Harmony.  Numerous state roads and local roads flooded by several feet.  Many local agricultural levees were overtopped.As this flood unfolded, cold air behind this storm system shut off the rain but left several inches of snow covering central and northern Indiana on the 7th and 8th.  Flooding fighting in southern Indiana occurred during rather harsh January conditions from the 7th through the 10th.  Milder conditions returned on the 11th.Some of the significant events during this flood include:Columbus, a large city in southern Indiana, had only one access road to I-65 causing long traffic delays.   Sandbagging efforts to save a power substation that served much of Rushville.A flood fight in Shelbyville to keep the Big Blue River from portions of the town.At least 70% of Jackson County was flooded.  Evacuations occurred in Rockford, Shields and Brownstown area.A levee failed along the Eel River in the Jasonville area.  Flood waters rose to within 10 inches of a power box for the Jasonville water system.  Power was shut down and the town lost its water until flood levels receded.Spencer lost wastewater treatment service.  This closed nearly all the restaurants in town.  Flood waters were within 2 ½ blocks of the Owen county courthouse.Flood waters at the Columbus wastewater treatment plant reached so high that employees were evacuated.  The plant was operated by the automated system for 12 hours.Personnel of the Indiana National Guard waged a major flood fight to save the Hazleton levee that protected nearly ½ of the town.  At times the levee partially failed but was reinforced.Personnel of the Indiana National Guard sandbagged at State Road 64 to protect East Mount Carmel, Indiana.  Sandbagging occurred on the Illinois side near Rochester.Potential major problems at the Edwardsport Power Plant on the White River were averted.Coal shipment to a major power plant in Gibson County was threatened by high levels on the Wabash River.  The situation was monitored closely.Local Sandbagging in the Elnora area saved several homes.While major flooding was spreading throughout southern Indiana, central Indiana experienced extensive flooding on the White River from Muncie through Indianapolis and the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes.  Sandbagging was necessary in Anderson and Ravenswood areas.   The warmer temperatures on the 11th began to melt the snow and ice that covered central and northern Indiana.  An additional 1 to 4 inches of rain fell in much of central Indiana late on the 11th.  This caused flash flooding in portions of Delaware, Madison, Tipton and Howard Counties.  The most serious flooding was in the towns of Alexandria and Kokomo.  Significant flooding occurred in Albany and Eaton.  Flooding returned to the White River in central Indiana as a result of the rain on the 11th.   After reaching a crest, the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes began to rise again.  January 12 was the warmest and one of the driest days in the New Year.  Temperatures in central and southern Indiana soared into the 60s.  Mild conditions were short lived.As cold air pushed through Indiana on the 13th, an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain fell in central and southern Indiana.  This rain caused widespread local flooding.  Major flooding developed along the White River in Hamilton and northern Marion Counties.  Flood levels approached those of January 1991 in this area.  Evacuations occurred in the Ravenswood area.  Some homes had their power turned off because of high water levels.Major flooding developed on the Wabash River from Lafayette to Vincennes as a result of the rain on the 13th.  Flood levels in the Lafayette and Covington areas reached their highest levels since July 2003.  Flooding from Montezuma to near Vincennes was the highest since June 1958.As this major flood crest was moving downstream along the Wabash River, flood fighting occurred under very brutal conditions.  Temperatures fell below freezing late on the 14th.  Snow of 1 to 4 inches fell in much of eastern Illinois and central Indiana on the 16th.  Temperatures dropped below zero on the 17th and 18th in the Hutsonville and Vincennes areas.  Temperature moderated to more normal levels by 19th.Areas along the Wabash River most severely flooded included, Montezuma, Clinton, Taylorville and Riverview in Indiana and Darwin, York, and Hutsonville in Illinois.  Flood waters overtopped many local agricultural levels.  Flood waters affected the cemetery at Palestine, Illinois. As the Wabash River approached record levels at Hutsonville, the Island Creek levee across from the Hutsonville Power Plant failed during the late evening on the 17th.  The level of the Wabash River fell 5 inches immediately in the town of Hutsonville.  Daylight revealed the levee breach was 300 to 500 feet wide and covered 5,000 acres of farmland with 7 to 8 feet of flood waters.  This breach damaged State Road 154 between Hutsonville and Grayville.  Now a short 5 mile drive for local residents was a 70 mile one way journey. The breach of the Island Creek levee caused the Wabash River to crest immediately at Hutsonville and very soon afterwards at Riverton.  The river crested at Vincennes within a day after the levee failure.  Water flowing back into the river from the area protected by the Island Creek levee caused another crest at Riverton and Vincennes.  This level was slightly lower than the crest after the breach.Rain on the 11th and 13th fell as the rivers were near crest in the Petersburg, Hazleton and Mount Carmel areas.  The combination of rain and very cold temperatures hindered flood fighting in these areas.  By the 13th the rivers crested at Petersburg, Hazleton, Mount Carmel and New Harmony.  Flood waters would continue to recede for the remainder of January, although at times very slowly. The flood crest at New Harmony was the highest since January 1950.Another crest followed the major flood that had occurred along the White and East Fork White Rivers in much of southern Indiana.  This crest was 2 to 3 feet lower on the White River from Centerton to Edwardsport.  On the East Fork White River this crest was more than 8 feet lower in the Columbus and Bedford areas and 1 ½ feet lower at Seymour.  These crests washed out as they approached Petersburg.  The great flood of January 2005 began to wind down at all locations on the 20th.  Mother Nature had thrown every type of severe winter weather at the residents in the Wabash River Valley. Upwards of 30 inches of snow and 12 inches of water had fallen during the prior 30 days.By the end of January flooding had ended everywhere in the Wabash River Valley except for lowland flooding along portions of the Wabash River.  Millions of dollars in flood damage had occurred since the beginning of winter.  The great flood of January 2005 was the most extensive in areal coverage for Indiana since March 1913 and possibly unprecedented.  At least 4,000 homes and businesses flooded and more than 7,000 people displaced.  One person died while attempting to cross the extensively flooded Wabash River in Warren County.Crests on the major rivers in central Indiana were as high as 15.5 feet above flood stage.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> A man attempted to cross a bridge over the swollen Wabash River and was swept to his death.  It was after dark, and water was over the road approaching the bridge.  It is believed that the man crawled through the car window in an attempt to get to safety and was swept away by the strong current.  The search was called off on 12 January to wait until the waters receded, due to the hazardous nature of the search.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 500K<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

To the south of the boundary, dew points were in the 50 to 55 degree range.  The heaviest rain amounts were from Perry County on north and east into eastern Ohio and western Pennsylvania.  Preliminary 5 day totals were 5.2 inches for New Lexington, 4.6 inches at McConnelsville, 4.5 inches at Nelsonville, 4.2 inches at McArthur and Beverly, 3.4 inches at Athens, and 2.9 inches at Marietta.  Small stream flooding started during the morning hours on the 5th, across Perry, Athens, Morgan, Vinton, and Washington Counties.  Some of the flooded streams included Jonathan Creek in northern Perry County, plus Monday and Sunday Creeks in southern Perry County and northern Athens County.   Sunday Creek crested at 15.8 feet on the 6th at Glouster, and near 23 feet at Millfield.  On Monday Creek, the gauge at Doanville crested at 19.1 feet on the 6th.  In Perry County, 9 families were evacuated.  The small stream flooding across Vinton County was limited to flooded roads.  Significant river flooding occurred on the Muskingum, the Hocking, and the Ohio River.  The crest on the Hocking River at Athens was 23.7 feet around 1100E on the 7th.  This was the highest level since the 24.65 feet observed on the 25th of May in 1968. It was the highest stage since the river was rechanneled in 1972. The crest level was also the 5th highest on record for Athens.  Communities such as Nelsonville and Chauncey were flooded.  The lowest and most vulnerable sections of Chauncey had water inside dwellings and other buildings.  In Athens, the storm drainage system backup into the business area along East State Street.  Some homes on Blick Avenue were flooded.  West Union Street was also flooded and closed.  Elsewhere in Athens County, the high water along the Ohio River affected Hockingport.  All total, about 73 homes in Athens County had minor damage, 56 homes had major damage, and 11 homes were destroyed.  About a dozen businesses applied for disaster loans.In McConnelsville of Morgan County, the Muskingum River crested at 13.45 feet around 1400E on the 6th.  This was the highest level since the 13.8 feet seen back in March 1964.  Water rescues were performed by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the county sheriff department.  An 85 year old woman was rescued from her flooded mobile home along the Muskingum River on the 6th.  She did not want to evacuate earlier and had her pets inside.  When finally rescued, she was sitting on a chair, with water almost up to her knees.  Her feet were swollen.  She never recovered from the hypothermia, and died several days later.   A second crest would occur less than a week later, from additional rain and dam releases.  See the 12th for details.  In Morgan County, around 142 homes had minor damage.  One furniture store in McConnelsville had flood waters inside.     In Washington County, small stream and river damage was less severe than in September 2004.  The Ohio River crested at 41.0 feet at Marietta 2SW during the predawn hours of the 8th.  The crest was 42.4 feet the previous September.  Flood stage is 34 feet.  Downtown Marietta streets and businesses were still flooded, but sandbags protected most 1st floors.  Further down the Ohio River, Racine Lock and Dam crested at 48.9 feet.  The crest at Pomeroy was 50.5 feet around 0000E on the 9th.  Flood stage is 46 feet at Pomeroy.  Back in September 2004 the crest was 51.2 feet.  Water still got into businesses.  All total, Meigs County had 17 homes with minor damage, 2 homes with major damage, and 3 homes destroyed.  Five businesses had major damage and 1 business was destroyed.     The crest near Gallipolis, at the RC Byrd Lock and Dam was 50.3 feet around 1400E on the 9th.  This was just over the 50 foot flood stage.  For the Chesapeake to South Point reach of the river, the Huntington gauge crested at 51.8 feet during the evening hours of the 9th.  This was about 6 inches higher than in September 2004.  Flood stage at Huntington is 50 feet.  Around 0845E on the 6th, just north of the Belleville Lock and Dam, the tugboat Jon Strong was heading up the Ohio River.  After passing through the lock chamber, 9 of the 12 barges came loose in the strong currents.  Three of barges sank under the gates of the dam, while 3 others were forced up against the dam pier houses.  Three other barges went through the structure and were recovered downstream.  Salvage crews did not remove all the damaged barges until the last day of the month.  Since the gates could not be closed, the pool above Belleville Lock and Dam dropped 10 to 15 feet below normal.  River traffic was suspended on the 19th.  River bank slippage occurred around Hockingport during the unusually low levels late in the month.  This caused damage to roads and a few homes. Water levels returned toward normal in early February.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 2M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The relatively warm air ahead of the storm raised snow levels and rain fell on an already deep snowpack and resulted in the second costliest natural disaster in state history. An estimated $300 million in damage was reported from flooding along the Santa Clara and Virgin Rivers in Washington County. One man was killed in the flooding near Quail Creek Reservior and three people perished in avalanches. The Virgin River water level reached a 25-year high and the Santa Clara River rose above any previously recorded level. 30 homes were destroyed as the Santa Clara changed course and cut through a portion of the community. Approximately 20 more homes were significantly damaged during this record flood event. This storm system also brought heavy and wet snowfall to elevations above 8000 feet. Many avalanches occurred throughout the state following the storm. A large avalanche killed a snowboarder in Ephraim Canyon. East of Mount Pleasant, a slide took the life of a snowmobiler. Some of the higher snowfall and water equivalent totals include: Cedar Breaks 70" and 10.70" water, Kolob-Zion Park 60" and 8.70, Alta 58 and 9.13, Solitude 55 and 9.71, Brian Head 51, Laketown 47 and 3.67, Snowbird 32 and 5.46, Randolph 32 and 2.18, The Canyons 31 and 3.55, Long Valley<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> nan<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 300M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];

The worst flooding occurred along the Raritan and Passaic River Basins. It was the worst flooding in the Raritan Basin since Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Bound Brook and Manville were once again hit hard as were communities on the other side of the Raritan River in Middlesex County. Along the Passaic Basin, Lincoln Park also was hit hard. The nor'easter also brought strong to high winds as well as some snow to the state on the 16th. Numerous streams and rivers flooded, but the flooding along the Delaware River was minimal.  |Statewide damage was estimated at $180 million dollars. It was the second worst rain storm (not related to a hurricane) in the state's history. Acting Governor Richard J. Codey declared a state of emergency on the 16th. About 5,000 people were evacuated in 11 of the state's 21 counties. At one time over 70 major roadways and interstates were closed including New Jersey State Routes 20, 23, 38, 46, 70 and 73 as well as U.S. Route 30 and Interstates 80 and 380. There were over 700 traffic accidents indirectly caused by the flooding and heavy rain. Three people in the state drowned. The strong winds caused about 120,000 homes and businesses in the state to lose power. Power was not completely restored until the 18th. The combination of the snow, wind (power outages) and flooding caused many school districts to either cancel classes or have delayed openings on the 16th. Even Rutgers University was closed on the 16th and 17th. In the Raritan Basin, school closings lasted into the week of April 23rd. The nor'easter was so nasty that even the Internal Revenue Service extended the tax deadline for 48 hours in affected areas. The heavy and flooding rains was expected to delay the spring planting on farms. Garden center and nursery business which was already slow because of the unseasonably cold weather was dealt another set-back. Twelve counties in the state were declared federal disaster areas and included Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, Mercer, Middlesex, Morris and Somerset Counties.   |Rain began falling throughout the area during the late evening on the 14th. It started briefly as snow over some of the higher terrain of Susse County. The rain fell at its heaviest from about 3 a.m. EDT on the 15th to about 3 a.m. EDT on the 16th. As the upper air disturbance moved across New Jersey, the rain did change to snow for a couple of hours around sunrise on the 16th and accumulated about an inch or two on grassy areas in western New Jersey. The steady precipitation ended during the afternoon and early evening on the 16th. Event precipitation totals averaged 3 to 6 inches. Event snowfall totals were an inch or two in most areas, mainly on grassy areas. |The strongest winds occurred as the nor'easter pulled northeast of the region on the 16th from the early morning into the afternoon. The combination of the heavy rain, even some snow and the winds helped knock down numerous trees and power lines. Peak wind gusts averaged between 40 and 60 mph.|The nor'easter low pressure system initially formed in the southern Rockies on the 12th and moved to Arkansas on the morning of the 14th. At 8 p.m. EDT on the 14th, there were two low pressure systems, one in Kentucky and the other in western Alabama. The southern low pressure system became the predominate one overnight and at 8 a.m. EDT on the 15th, it (996 millibar low) was located in western North Carolina. As the 15th continued, it moved northeast and intensified rapidly. At 2 p.m. EDT the nor'easter (989 millibars) was near Raleigh, North Carolina. At 8 p.m. EDT, the nor'easter was a 979 millibar low pressure system near Virginia Beach, Virginia. Another low pressure system formed on its warm front during the afternoon over Chesapeake Bay and at 8 p.m. EDT it (982 millibars) was over extreme southwest New Jersey. The lows consolidated into one again overnight and a very intense 973 millibar low pressure system was located over Monmouth County, New Jersey at 2 a.m. EDT on the 16th. At 8 a.m. EDT on the 16th the nor'easter was down to 968 millibars and located over New York City. That was a drop in central pressure of 28 millibars in 24 hours which qualified it as a meteorological bomb (a drop in central pressure of at least 24 millibars in 24 hours) low pressure system. The nor'easter bottomed at a pressure of about 966 millibars (28.53 inches) at 11 a.m. EDT just south of Long Island, New York. To put into prospective how low the pressure was with this nor'easter, that central pressure is near the border of the pressure defined category 2 and category 3 hurricane once used on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. As the 16th continued, the nor'easter weakened and meandered across southwest New England and the New York and New Jersey coastal waters. By 2 a.m. EDT on the 17th, the nor'easter's central pressure rose to 988 millibars and a second storm formed on the triple point of its fronts south of Nova Scotia. This became the main low pressure system. The low pressure system then slowly moved southeast over the next couple of days. The heaviest precipitation fell as the low pressure system was rapidly intensifying on the 15th into the early part of the 16th. The strongest winds ceased after the low pressure system started to fill on the afternoon of the 16th.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> In Middlesex County, nearly every municipality suffered flood damage or had roads closed due to flooding. Many major roads were flooded including U.S. Routes 1 and 9 and New Jersey State Routes 18 and 27. Nearly 1,000 people were evacuated and 129 homes suffered severe damage. A 52-year-old man drowned in Woodbridge after he drove his vehicle into a flooded underpass (Leesville Avenue). The three other family members in the car were able to be saved. Many sewage treatment plants were overwhelmed and raw sewage backed into police stations and basements of homes. |In Carteret Borough, 25 roads were closed. In Woodbridge Township, about 300 people were evacuated. The Queens Gardens Apartment Complex and the Ideal Mobile Home were evacuated. Flooding occurred along both the Woodbridge Creek and the Rahway River. The worst flooding occurred in the Avenel section of the township.

In Piscataway Township, about 300 people were evacuated and 8 roadways were closed. The Bridge for the New Market Pond collapsed. The flooding's epicenter was around River Road. The Mayflower, Birchview and Rivercrest Apartments were evacuated. |In New Brunswick, major traffic headaches occurred because of the Raritan River flooding of New Jersey State Route 18. The Interchange 9 exit was closed on the New Jersey Turnpike. Rutgers University cancelled classes on both the 16th and 17th. In Sayreville Borough, residents along Weber Avenue and near the Old Bridge section near the South River were evacuated. In South River Borough, evacuations occurred around the Causeway Bridge and Water Street. About 75 homes were flooded. In Milltown Borough, a flooded substation caused 7,000 people to lose power. The borough's post office suffered extensive flood damage. The Lawrence Brook flooded.|In East Brunswick, evacuations occurred on their side of Old Bridge near the South River. In South Brunswick, limited evacuations occurred at the Oakdale Mobile Home near U.S. Route 1. Flood waters tore away chunks of U.S. Route 1. About 50 dogs were rescued from a flooded kennel. Eighteen roads were closed and thirty-six homes were flooded. In Monroe Township, nine families were evacuated from the Mill Lake Manor section. Fifteen roadways were closed. In Cranbury Township, Brainard Lake overflowed. In Plainsboro Township, so many roads were flooded that the township was practically an island until the 17th.|The Raritan River at Bound Brook (Somerset County) was above its 28 foot flood stage from 644 p.m. EDT on the 15th through 350 p.m. on the 17th. It crested at 38.38 feet at 1245 p.m. EDT on the 16th.  It was the 2nd highest crest on record, second only to the crest from Hurricane Floyd on September 17th, 1999. The Bound Brook at Middlesex was above its 9 foot flood stage from 655 p.m. EDT on the 15th through 717 p.m. EDT on the 16th.

This intense low in combination with high pressure over eastern Canada produced Overview: An area of low pressure intensified rapidly as it moved slowly from the southeastern United States on the morning of Sunday, April 15th to near New York City by the morning of Monday, April 16th.  The intense low over New York City in combination with high pressure over eastern Canada produced a very intense pressure gradient across the area which caused strong east to northeast winds to develop across the region.  Over land, the strong winds downed numerous trees.  The downed trees caused widespread power outages, especially near the coast, and numerous road closures.  Over the marine areas, the strong winds caused a storm surge and large ocean waves of up to 30 feet to develop.  The combination of astronomical high tides, storm surge, and large waves contributed to coastal flooding in coastal areas of the state and severe coastal erosion in areas south of Portland.|The storm also brought heavy rain to the region which, when combined with snow melt, produced widespread flooding across much of the region.  The flooding of small rivers and streams was worst in southern and coastal areas and led to numerous road closures.   In the mountains, the rain was preceded by heavy snow.  Flooding was minor on most mainstem rivers, however, in southern Maine, the Presumpscot River reached near record levels. |The intense low drifted very slowly eastward from Monday morning through Friday morning as it gradually weakened.  During this time, the pressure gradient slowly relaxed, the winds gradually diminished, and the seas slowly subsided.  However, rain continued into Tuesday across the region and each high tide during the period brought a reoccurrence of coastal flooding and erosion to the area.  Power outages persisted, and stream and river flooding continued across the region during this period.  Many roads remained closed.|On Friday, April 20, high pressure built eastward from the Great Lakes ending the influence of the Atlantic storm.  |  |Wind: The pressure gradient associated with the storm brought high winds to the region.  The damage observed in the hardest hit areas was typical of wind gusts of 60 to 80 mph.  While most observing sites reported winds below this range, topography, elevation, and exposure were likely factors in determining the amount of wind damage any location experienced.  In addition, the heavy rain brought strong wind gusts to the ground level and contributed to the sporadic nature of the heaviest wind damage.  In addition to the meteorological factors, damage from the wind was exacerbated because of the heavy rain that accompanied the wind and the soft, wet ground caused by the spring thaw.|The wind knocked over numerous trees and branches throughout the region and caused numerous and prolonged power outages throughout the region.| |Coastal Flooding/Storm Surge/Waves:  The coastal storm hit during a period of very high (and very low) astronomical tides.  In addition to the astronomical tides, the prolonged period of strong northeast winds caused a prolonged storm surge along the coastline.  Also during this period, the strong winds caused large and battering waves along the coast.  The storm tides and large waves caused significant flooding and coastal erosion. |In Portland, flood level is 12 feet.  During the storm, storm tides reached or exceeded the 12 foot flood level during 7 tidal cycles.  In addition, due to the large waves, coastal erosion occurred throughout the week of April 15th to 20th when the Portland gauge was above or near the 12 foot flood level.  Communication was lost with NOAA���s Portland Weather Buoy shortly after 6 am Monday when it was reporting 31 foot seas.|Precipitation:  Rain developed across the southern part of the state early Sunday afternoon, April 15th and spread northward.  The rain became heavy during the afternoon and overnight.  By Monday morning, 3 to 7 inches of rain had fallen in York County with rainfall amounts decreasing to 1 to 4 inches to the north and east.    In the mountains of Maine, 2 to 7 inches of snow fell by Monday morning.  Although the heaviest precipitation fell from Sunday afternoon into Monday afternoon, precipitation persisted into Tuesday.  Rainfall in Southern Maine was near the 100 year recurrence interval at Sanford and Eliot.|Flooding:  The heavy rain combined with snow melt to cause flooding of small rivers and streams in much of southern and central Maine.   The worst flooding occurred on the smaller rivers in York County.  Damage to infrastructure was severe (roads, bridges, waste water treatment plants, public buildings). Homes and businesses were also damaged. In York County, two people were killed when they attempted to cross a flooded road on foot and were swepted away. The crest on the Presumpscot River was just below the crest recorded during Hurricane Bob in August of 1991.<br><br>                <b>Event Narrative:</b> Flooding and damages were countywide.<br><br>                <b>Damage:</b> 25.00M<br><br>               </div>`)[0];
